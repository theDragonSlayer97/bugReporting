Without this, proper support for a client/server split and job-based parallelism with communication through channels will be practically impossible. I'm working on the graphics side of things, so I'd like to work on decoupling the GUI first.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this design goal, we unfortunately have to get rid of all the `GuiLink`s as they stand, as well as any other links to non-GUI engine components (e.g. `EngineQMLInfo`). From a very high-level viewpoint, the initial idea of how we could replace this is a callback system, where all communication proceeds solely through the `Gui` class, with an API of something like:\r\n```c++\r\nclass Gui {\r\npublic:\r\n  Gui (SDL_Window*, util::Path const& source, util::Path const& root_dir); // no EngineQMLInfo\r\n\r\n  void register_on_X_cb(std::function<..> callback); // registers a function to be called when X happens in the GUI\r\n\r\n  void enqueue_event(SDL_Event*); // stores an event to be processed\r\n  void process_events(); // actually processes events and calls callbacks\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n  internal state\r\n};\r\n```\r\nObviously, we will need more than just the above in practice, but the general idea is that the GUI is an event-based component like any other. By itself it doesn't do anything. The user registers functions that they want called on GUI state changes. To give an example, currently changing properties of a game involves a `GameControlLink` that directly manipulates `Engine` members. This is unfortunate, because it will result in completely unpredictable behaviour in a concurrent execution context. Instead, what we would have is a `on_game_property_changed` callback which is called from `process_events` whenever the GUI detects that one of the enqueued events is a mouse click on something that triggers a game property change. It is up to the user to ensure threadsafety for that callback, and what we would in fact do is either make that callback send an event on the `WorldUpdater` concurrent input channel or directly modify some property of the `PresentationState`, which is local to the `Presenter` class - the user of the GUI.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to hear thoughts on this, especially from @ChipmunkV, who I understand is the principal author of the GUI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/854","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/854/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/854/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/854/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/854","id":233961916,"number":854,"title":"[WIP]Python profiling utility","user":{"login":"ohn0","id":12635016,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12635016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ohn0","html_url":"https://github.com/ohn0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ohn0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ohn0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ohn0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ohn0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ohn0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ohn0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ohn0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ohn0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ohn0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":142056555,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/nice%20new%20thing%20%E2%98%BA","name":"nice new thing ☺","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":142245512,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/python","name":"python","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-06T17:09:47Z","updated_at":"2017-06-21T11:02:53Z","closed_at":"2017-06-21T11:02:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/pulls/854","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/854","diff_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/854.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/854.patch"},"body":"This is for #826.
