For an installed game, this should be `/usr/share/openage` (installed by the package) and `~/.openage` (the user-writable \"userasset\" folder).\n\nYou can also specify further paths to look for packs.\n\nThe userasset folder is used for storing files that are created by the user (e.g.: datapacks (converted game assets)), savegames, screenshots, etc.\n\nThe \"asset locating mode\" may be specified via `--assets={dev, installed}`. If not specified, it's auto-determined from the files in the folder where the executable lies (does `openage_version` exist?). `dev` => look in ./assets.\n\nPerformance optimization feature: Support packing folders in (tar) archives.\n\nThe AssetLoader takes an asset path (such as `termcolors.docx`) and an optional \"on-modification\" callback function (think inotify, manual \"reload-assets\" instruction) and returns a file-like object for reading (or raise an Exception).\n\nAll code in openage should rely on the AssetLocator instead of directly opening files.\n##

related to the conversion targets (#79) and the version detection (#61) is the support of converting media and game files from setup disk images. The Python module `openage.cabextract` provides cab extraction features needed by the `.cab` files on the disc.\r\n1. Pass ISO mount point of the original CD (or even call the `udiskctl` command)\r\n2. Detect version of the disk image\r\n3. Use `fslike` abstraction to mount all archives on disk.\r\n4. Convert contents of mounted archives.\r\n\r\nThe invokation should originate from `openage/convert/driver.py`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/82/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/81","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/81/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/81/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/81/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/81","id":47524809,"number":81,"title":"Add
