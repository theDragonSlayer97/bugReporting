the fps are only capped by vsync.\n\nOn my machine, vsync is deactivated once the game windows is move to background (no longer visible), and the fps skyrocket and heat up my machine to 96°C.\n\nThere should be some capping which could be configurable through a command line option `--fps 60`. \n\nThis is obviously enabled additionaly to vsync, so when vsync is active, the fps limit should not prevent frame skips (e.g. just use 70 as limit).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/169","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/169/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/169/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/169/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/169","id":49817046,"number":169,"title":"Ensure
