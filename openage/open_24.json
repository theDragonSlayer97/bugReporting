This aims to close that issue, and enables openage to be built on MSYS2 with traditional `cmake` by stubbing not yet implemented (and coincidentally, unused) features under WIN32. \n\nA better solution is to implement the features (I think this is desirable on os.cpp functions), or strip the entire feature from all platforms if it's not useful (I never used the console tests, they seem dated).\n\nNeeds #218 so it should be merged first, and this branch should be rebased. If you want to test, just pull TheJJ/math-constants into master, and then this branch into the result, it should build.\n\nIn contrast with mappu's guide, this doesn't modify`./configure` nor `buildsystem/simple`. Also, the majority of the patches that mappu required are no longer necessary due to better code quality :) Oh, and we now have opusfile on the MSYS2 repos, so no manual compiling of that dep.\n\nTL;DR: \n\n```\n# convert assets or copy them already converted\nmkdir build && cd build\ncmake -G \"MSYS Makefiles\" .. #configures flawlessly\nmake #compiles flawlessly\ncd .. #changes directory flawlessly\n./build/cpp/openage #runs flawlessly\n```\n\n---\n\nThis was on a Windows7 32bit VM.
