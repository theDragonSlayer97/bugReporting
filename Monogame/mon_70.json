VB and IB were disposed.  I was then going to write this issue saying we need to implement the same checks and exceptions in MonoGame.\n\nBUT\n\n![snip](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/103522/7861056/71b8980c-0513-11e5-807f-ab89979cc7f0.PNG)\n\nXNA does not throw any exceptions or errors in this case...  In fact it happily draws correctly to the screen... doesn't matter how long it runs.\n\nSo I suspect what is happening is a side effect of DirectX being COM based.  COM is reference counted.  So when the VB and IB are set on the GraphicsDevice the underlying `ID3D9GraphicsDevice` is taking a reference to those resources.  When the `Dispose()` is called by the code above it basically does nothing as the resource is still owned by the DX9 device.\n\nSecond issue...  although XNA doesn't throw exceptions in this case, should we fix MonoGame to protect against these mistakes?  This behavior is very weird... and tied to the fact that XNA uses DirectX which is COM reference counted.\n\nIMO we shouldn't allow this behavior...  it is hard to replicate across all platforms, it is non-intuitive, and you basically loose control over when your resources are freed.  I think the rule we should follow is simple:\n\n>  You can dispose resources immediately after a draw, but no future draws with that resource should work.\n\nSimple rule... easy to replicate reliably on all platforms.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4854","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"98DC:572A:6DBBE6:F6EBAE:59D6A754","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=71>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=200>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=69>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"416ea782c1bd29d89b0146e1377b9b80\"","status":"200 OK"}}
