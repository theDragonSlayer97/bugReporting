I do wonder if this could be fixable by letting the position of the directional light be the center of a region where the PSSM shadow-maps are calculated (and as such shadowing will not exist beyond it). That way I can use a parenting setup to move the directional light, and as such the shadow field with the player and eliminate the distance limit (and perhaps reduce the resolution needed for decent shadows as well).\n\nThoughts, I think my suggestion may be possible to do with the current OpenGL-ES2

Opus is unmatched for interactive speech and music transmission over the Internet, but is also intended for storage and streaming applications. It is standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as RFC 6716 which incorporated technology from Skype's SILK codec and Xiph.Org's CELT codec.\n> \n> Opus can handle a wide range of audio applications, including Voice over IP, videoconferencing, in-game chat, and even remote live music performances. It can scale from low bitrate narrowband speech to very high quality stereo music. Supported features are:\n> - Bitrates from 6 kb/s to 510 kb/s\n> - Sampling rates from 8 kHz (narrowband) to 48 kHz (fullband)\n> - Frame sizes from 2.5 ms to 60 ms\n> - Support for both constant bitrate (CBR) and variable bitrate (VBR)\n> - Audio bandwidth from narrowband to fullband\n> - Support for speech and music\n> - Support for mono and stereo\n> - Support for up to 255 channels (multistream frames)\n> - Dynamically adjustable bitrate, audio bandwidth, and frame size\n> - Good loss robustness and packet loss concealment (PLC)\n> - Floating point and fixed-point implementation\n\nOpus compression performs better than Vorbis compression, which is the main rationale to implement it.\n\nAs far as I know, Godot does not support Opus, neither the Opus container (.opus) which is preferred nor Ogg Opus (.ogg).

current head. Win32 version.\nOS : Windows 8.1 64bits.\n\nWhen the \"set path as relative\" option is enabled into the Editor Settings and save your scene, there is an extra slash bar added to relative paths after depth -1 relation.\n\nDepth -1, Ok : \"../script.gd\"\nDepth -2, Bug : \"../..//script.gd\"\nDepth -3, Bug : \"../../..//script.gd\"\n\nBecause I'm not sure if the explanation is clear enough, here is how to replicate :\n- activate the \"set path as relative\" option\n- create a new scene with a TestCube as root node.\n- set material override to FixedMaterial and attach the \"res://icon.png\" as diffuse texture.\n- save your scene into \"res://sub/sub/your_scene.scn\"\n- now, reopen the scene you've just saved, and the texture will be gone.\n\nSave it again to XML and you'll see the relative path for the texture is \"../..//icon.png\".\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1693","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1693/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1693/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1693/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1693","id":68486866,"number":1693,"title":"Windows
