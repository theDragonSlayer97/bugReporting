(This is guaranteed to always be a path followed by the results, so there's no risk of lost information.)\n- The fuzzy file finder now implements `nak` as well. It takes about a second to perform a full retrieve on `~/github/github`, without includes. (The dir-walker I wrote is actually the fastest part, and you can also set up file/dir ignores.)\n- By default, `nak` includes your ignore files. `config.set(nak.addVCSIgnores, true)` if you need them excluded.\n\nMy questions:\n- I'm not particularly proud of `project.previewList = @previewList` in _command-panel-view.coffee_, but I didn't know how else to pass the previewList object to _select-all-matches-in-project.coffee_.\n- There's a lot of leftover `@operations` crud in _preview-list.coffee_--should I get rid of it? I didn't know if it did anything else.\n- I don't know how to run the tests :crying_cat_face:. `rake test` started downloading the `node` tar and that seemed like a waste of time.\n- In addition to _.gitignore_, you can also set up a _.nakignore_. That's not in the code here but it's something to consider.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/459","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/459/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/459/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/459/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/459","id":12526004,"number":459,"title":"wfarr

Loading a package has no side effects. It just performs the I/O necessary to load all its resources, which are later installed when the package is

isn't quite how I'd like it because it still emits a global 'grammars-loaded' event after all the packages have been loaded. It uses a queue to serialize the loading of each package's grammars, then emits this event when the queue is empty. Instead, I'd like to fire an event every time a grammar is added and have a `LanguageMode` switch to that grammar if it is a better match. Then any time a grammar is added we can respond appropriately with the currently open edit sessions. But I want to clean up package loading first so this was a good way to get this merged to master now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/447","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/447/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/447/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/447/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/447","id":12343671,"number":447,"title":"WIP:
