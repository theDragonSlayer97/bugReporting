Running the command below will help if you still cannot reproduce the error:\n\n``` bash\n$ sudo nice -n -20 stress --io 8 --cpu 8\n```\n\nBack to the randomly failing tests! :fire: \n### Why did they fail, then?\n\nOur `spec-helper` is supposed to clear all the state from previous tests during `beforeEach` and `afterEach`: in practice, however, it doesn't do so for `setInterval` and `clearInterval`. The specs which use those two methods, either directly or indirectly, need to make sure to clean the state themselves or even mock those functions if they need them to write a particular expectation.\n\nSpecifically, the root of the failures resided in a dirty `ViewRegistry` which contained an active `setInterval` function instantiated by the previous SUT (e.g. `SelectListView` uses a `TextEditorView`, which in turn uses a `TextEditorComponent`, which in turn uses a `ViewRegistry` via `@pollDocument`) and which were being triggered during `TextEditorComponent` tests. The reason why they presented to ourselves in a randomized fashion, was because the _unmocked_ `setInterval` method was used during `SelectListView` specs and the system triggered the timeout independently from our `advanceClock`.\n### A solution\n\nMy first reaction was to always mock `setInterval` and `clearInterval`, as `TextEditorComponent` does, in our `spec-helper`, but then I noticed this in `text-editor-presenter-spec.coffee`:\n\n``` coffee\n# These *should* be mocked in the spec helper, but changing that now would break packages :-(\nspyOn(window, \"setInterval\").andCallFake window.fakeSetInterval\nspyOn(window, \"clearInterval\").andCallFake window.fakeClearInterval\n```\n- A quick workaround could be to mock such methods only while running core tests. The question is: do we have a way to recognize when we're in such environment?\n- An alternative could be to mock those two methods in `select-list-view-spec`, but we wouldn't use them at all for our test assertions and I'd love not to bother with this stuff every time we deal with a SUT which uses those methods internally (also because we may not be aware of that).\n\nThat said, I have decided to put a `@stopPollingDocument` right inside `ViewRegistry#clearDocumentRequests` which, to be fair, seems a quite reasonable tradeoff to me. This seems to have fixed those spurious errors once for all (https://travis-ci.org/atom/atom/jobs/58576153) and I cannot reproduce them locally anymore :tada: \n\nI'd :heart: to hear your feedback on this :bow: \n\n/cc: @kevinsawicki @maxbrunsfeld

In both cases, there wasn't a good reason why they should have failed and, therefore, I decided to fix them :green_heart: \n\nPlease note that, although my ultimate goal is to make every spec bullet-proof, the changes here proposed are deliberately not comprehensive: there are a bunch of other tests which need to be inspected (see #6274) but I think it's better to address each of them incrementally, without creating gargantuan pull requests.\n\nAlso, I think this highlights the importance of running specs on every platform: even though all the tests hereby addressed were failing because of a bug in the test itself (and not in our production code), there's a quite high risk of introducing bugs on other platforms without noticing it.\n\nAn additional pair of :eyes: is most welcome, especially for some changes (in which I am going to write an additional comment).\n\nThanks :bow: \n\n/cc: @maxbrunsfeld @nathansobo @kevinsawicki
