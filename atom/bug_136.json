box (Gentoo, Awesome WM without other graphic environments) After one or two switches Atom crashesh displaying error \"The Editor has crashed ...\". After reloading the window it works unless I switch the desktops again.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. launch atom\n2. Switch to other desktop and switch back\n3. Repeat the step 2. several times fast enough (I noticed that when I'm switching desktop every 15-20 seconds, the issue appears but not so often. If I switch it in 1-5 seconds it appears almost always).\n4. The error appears. Restart Atom -> point 1\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\n\nThe app should not crash.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\n\nThe app Crashes.\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.7.3\nElectron: 0.36.12\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 5.10.1\npython 3.4.3\ngit 2.7.3\n\nOs: Gentoo linux (rolling release, no version)\n\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line.

Go to a package with at least one config field of type string. (for example, Ignored Name field in fuzzy-finder package)\n- Try typing something like `#{ a }` to the string field\n- Atom will display an error message saying that config.cson cannot be loaded. And configuration will not work anymore unless you go to the config.cson file and delete the error line manually.\n\nThis probably is because config.cson is treated as a regular coffee script file and `\"#{ a }\"` is treated as a coffee script string interpolation which translated to `\"...\" + a + \"...\"` in javascript. Since `a` is not presented in the scope, it causes the error.\nI think sanitizing the string before writing to config.cson should make this problem go away.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11739","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11739/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11739/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11739/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11739","id":154387338,"number":11739,"title":"Atom helper occupies high CPU resource","user":{"login":"Shikugawa","id":17607122,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17607122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shikugawa","html_url":"https://github.com/Shikugawa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shikugawa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shikugawa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shikugawa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shikugawa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shikugawa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shikugawa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shikugawa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shikugawa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shikugawa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-12T03:07:07Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T18:46:20Z","closed_at":"2016-05-12T12:28:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When I use atom on mac(OS X 10.11.4), atom is very dull behavior, so I check Activity monitor, and I discovered that atom helper occupies high CPU resource.

When the app is running, subsequent attempts to use the `atom` command do not work.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Ensure installation of shell commands from the atom menu.\n2. Quit Atom. \n3. Open Terminal\n4. execute `atom my_file.txt` (works!)\n5. execute `atom my_other_file.txt` (doesn't work :-/)\n\n**Expected behavior:** The `atom` command should open files/folders upon subsequent attempts.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Subsequent attempts do quickly flash the Mac menu bar's active application from **Terminal** to **Atom**, but the file never opens.\n### Versions\n\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line.

The dev console doesn't show any information either.\n\nHappens when editing a local file, while typing. \n\nMaybe this is related? #11590 talks about this happening while having lots of uncommited files. In my case just one is enough. Using atom in safe mode and editing a file that is not under version control works fine.\n\n[operation_log.txt](https://gist.github.com/andrinheusser/7c753cf2552dc3c75f7dda96647d06f3)\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Use Atom v1.7.2 for a while on Windows 10 x64.\n2. Editor crashes almost every hour when I'm regularly typing in the editor.\n\nExpected behavior: Should not crash that often.\n\nActual behavior: Crashes frequently.\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.7.3\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.3\ngit\nvisual studio\n\nWin 10 x64\nIntel i5-2500 @ 3.3 GHz\n16 GB Ram\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11735","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11735/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11735/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11735/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11735","id":154282782,"number":11735,"title":"Lazy evaluation of search results may fail if the app window gets resized","user":{"login":"fabiospampinato","id":1812093,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1812093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato","html_url":"https://github.com/fabiospampinato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-05-11T16:12:09Z","updated_at":"2016-05-15T13:22:34Z","closed_at":"2016-05-12T12:30:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nLazy evaluation of search results gets triggered on scroll, that's way the initial showed results are a bit more than what can be displayed without scrolling.
