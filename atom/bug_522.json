talked with @nathansobo a bit about this in Kona. Basically, one of Emacs' best features is it doesn't couple splits to buffers, which makes opening and closing splits really powerful.\n\nWhat I'm proposing is:\n- Decouple buffers from splits on the backend\n- Maintain the current Cmd-W behavior (that closes buffers and then eventually a pane)\n\nThis way the crazy Emacs-loving types like myself don't get frustrated with the splits, but the ST2-style behavior can remain default for everybody else. \n\nHere's basically what I'm proposing to be able to do, in slightly Emacs-ish terms:\n\n```\nwindow.keymap.bindKeys '*',\n  'ctrl-x 0':

This branch  prefixes core atom events similarly. I think this will help organize the events and make the system more comprehensible. The prefix scheme is basically describing what piece of the system is intended to receive the event.\n\nThere are 3 new prefixes:\n- `core:` This is for all events that have universal meaning, like moving, selecting, copying, pasting, etc. These could be interpreted by the editor, but also extensions.\n- `editor:` This is for events that only make sense in the context of the editor.\n- `root-view:` A handful of events, like switching panes or changing the font size, are handled mainly by the root view.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/57/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/56","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/56/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/56/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/56/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/56","id":7339258,"number":56,"title":"Support command extensions","user":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2012-10-04T00:52:56Z","updated_at":"2014-09-30T20:59:58Z","closed_at":"2013-01-07T17:43:12Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/56","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/56","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/56.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/56.patch"},"body":"### Goal\n\nMake it easier to write extensions that only operate on editors and do not contribute any UI such as commands that alter the currently selected text.\n\nThere are two initial command extensions for upper-casing and lower-casing the selected text included in this PR.\n### Example\n\nA simple command extension to remove vowels from the selected text.  The parent class, `EditorCommand`, handles registering the keymaps in all current and future editors and calls the `execute` method defined.  `EditorCommand` provides a helper to alter the current selection with some replacement text.\n\n``` coffeescript\nclass VowelRemover extends EditorCommand\n  @getKeymaps: (editor) ->\n     'meta-V': 'devowel'\n\n  @execute: (editor, event) ->\n    @replaceSelectedText editor, (text) ->\n      text.replace(/[aeiouy]/gi, '')\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/56/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/55","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/55/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/55/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/55/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/55","id":7338587,"number":55,"title":"Event palette","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2012-10-04T00:08:26Z","updated_at":"2012-10-19T22:19:32Z","closed_at":"2012-10-19T20:08:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/55","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/55","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/55.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/55.patch"},"body":"The event palette is similar to Sublime's command palette.
