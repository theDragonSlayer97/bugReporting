I had an indentation error come back from the compiler, so I had to go through the file line by line in order to compare the position of my line indents.\n\nWhat I noticed, is that the column count can be different depending on if user uses a tab vs a space.\n\nSo for example, \n![screen shot 2016-01-20 at 4 25 59

character (which is the whitespace char leading line 9) -- and then replace this whitespace char with spaces (spacebar), then column position is 4, not three\n\n![screen shot 2016-01-20 at 4 27 22

with spacebar spaces... \n\ncol position is 4 under this use case\n\nplease address this so that column count is found uniformly, it would make it much easier to troubleshoot \nfiles where indentation

to launch Atom in specific states is a bit of magic that is only known to a few. Some features are more obvious like Dev Mode and Safe Mode, but even then the full effects of each of these modes are not fully documented anywhere and therefore they are often misunderstood even by people who use these modes often. The purpose of this Issue initially is to capture the list of initial states that people want to launch Atom into. Eventually we will create a plan and design for making each of them easy, well understood and as obvious as possible to newcomers to Atom. If possible, I'll add links to other Issues, PRs, Discuss topics and other sources to illustrate.\n## Atom Launch Modes\n\nThese are the modes that Atom more-or-less supports or are implied by the modes that Atom does support.\n- Project (whether with single or multiple roots)\n- No project &mdash; Open specific files with no tree view\n- Restore last state (project or no project)\n- Restore specific project state\n- Dev Mode &mdash; Since this is designed as an aid for Atom development, it mostly only makes sense in combination with the project mode (but perhaps I'm overlooking something)\n- Safe Mode &mdash; Can be combined with any of the above modes (other than Dev Mode)\n\nEach of these should have an obvious and unambiguous way of launching them both from the command line and from the GUI.\n### Additional Command Line Thoughts\n\nSometimes people want to modify the state of Atom from the command line and sometimes they don't. Some consideration should be given to these scenarios:\n- Add a file to an open session of Atom\n- Add a project root to an open session of Atom\n- Launch Atom in any mode when an open session of Atom is running (even when it may seem the user may want one of the two above but doesn't ... for instance \"open a file that exists in the project that is open in the current session of Atom, but I want it in a new Atom session with **no** project\")\n## Mode State\n\nThere are things that are serialized and stored when Atom exits. It is completely non-obvious what items belong to this set and what items do not as well as how to restore the saved items when next launching Atom. Decisions should be made about whether some of these items belong to the specific mode that Atom is in or if they are more global state that people expect to be in place the next time Atom is launched (or even an individual file is opened post-launch) no matter what mode Atom is launched in.\n- List of open tabs\n- Editor state &mdash; Where the cursor is in the file, etc\n- Unsaved changes to files\n- Untitled buffers\n- Per file indentation settings\n- Per file line ending settings\n- Per file encoding settings\n- [Pane configuration](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10545)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10517/reactions","total_count":15,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10516","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10516/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10516/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10516/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10516","id":127662170,"number":10516,"title":"Unsaved untitled buffers don't survive an OS crash","user":{"login":"ekantola","id":507125,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/507125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantola","html_url":"https://github.com/ekantola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekantola/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-01-20T11:26:00Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T21:08:29Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T21:08:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Unsaved buffers in Atom 1.4.0 (Windows) don't seem to get restored in case of an OS hard reset or equivalent, even though they AFAIK should (ref: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/942).
