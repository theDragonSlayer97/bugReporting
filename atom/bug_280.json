love to have this here `will-remove-item` event on Pane. The motivation is for oggy/tab-switcher#11, where I want to determine in a `did-change-active-item` hook if an item is being activated because the user clicked the tab, or if it's just because the active item was removed and this was next to it (which I could do by setting a flag between `will-remove-item` and `did-remove-item`).\n\nThere are probably many possible solutions here, but this seemed the most generic.

https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6733#issuecomment-113870997:\n\n> Hey, awesome work on the tile rendering! I've got one problem with it, however, as it breaks my block-cursor package.\n> \n> To have a block-cursor, I used to add a (opaque) background color to the cursor element, and set its z-index to -1. That way, the cursor would render behind the text, and text would still be legible.\n> \n> Now, with the new tile rendering, all the lines are inside a new element with an opaque background, so I can't render the cursor behind the lines anymore (or it would also be behind the tile, and thus invisible anyway)...\n> \n> There's the option to set a very low alpha value on the cursor color, and render it in front of the text, but that way the cursor changes the text color, and it's tricky to find a value that produces a nice color and keeps text legible.\n\nFrom that same thread:\n\n> > Hmmm, I just thought that highlights might suffer from the same issue, but then I found that a highlights container is added to each tile. I wonder if this is also possible for the cursors, or would it be too much of a performance issue? Or just too much work for too little gain?\n> \n> Given that tiles have an opaque background, I am afraid this is the only possible solution. Moreover, that would be consistent with how we handle highlights, as you’re pointing out.

I followed the [build instructions for Linux](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/docs/build-instructions/linux.md) but as with my [previous attempt](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6774) issues where encountered at the `script/build` line. I looked at the [package.json](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/package.json) file to look for dependencies I might be missing, but many of these packages are either not available on Ubuntu or are differently named in the Ubuntu repositories. \n\nI was wondering if anyone here might know what they are all called on Ubuntu as I suspect that not having all the build dependencies may be why I can't seem to build Atom on Ubuntu from source. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7377","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7377/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7377/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7377/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7377","id":90227053,"number":7377,"title":"Add cross-platform \"About Atom\" view","user":{"login":"mnquintana","id":823545,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/823545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana","html_url":"https://github.com/mnquintana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":163641905,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/atom","name":"atom","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":193722948,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-06-22T22:13:24Z","updated_at":"2015-07-28T23:20:48Z","closed_at":"2015-07-27T17:42:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/7377","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7377","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7377.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7377.patch"},"body":"Closes https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3377\nCloses https://github.com/atom/about/issues/2\n\nThis PR adds a new package - [`about`](https://github.com/mnquintana/atom-about) - dedicated to viewing information about your Atom installation within Atom, across all platforms.\n\n![About screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mnquintana/atom-about/master/resources/about-atom.png)\n\n_Note: The color on the Atom logo is the hover state._\n\nRight now it doesn't do a whole lot (you can copy the version number though), but I have several enhancements planned right now (showing all Atom org contributors, checking for updates, checking if latest commit if using built Atom, installed packages, etc), but that should make it a bit easier to review.
