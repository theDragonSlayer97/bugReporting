This is due to the fact that [Electron](http://github.com/atom/electron), as of `v0.29.0` now builds an [ARM compatible distribution](https://github.com/atom/electron/releases/tag/v0.29.0) :sparkles: (as an aside, this is really, really great news for future applications and tinkerers). But the latest versions of Electron use a newer version of Chrome and have not been tested against Atom which [currently uses](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/package.json#L15) `v.22.3` of Electron (at this time Electron was still named Atom-Shell). Typing and clicking don't work at all and/or trigger lots of exception notifications and render the application pretty useless. This could be because of the new Electron compatibility issues, but we can't be quite sure as we don't really know yet what those issues are. \n\n**What will it take to get there?**\n\nThese errors will have to be sorted out and fixed. This is not on any roadmap right now and could be a lot of work (patches welcome! :raised_hands:). Getting Atom upgraded to the latest Electron will help answer this question but it's not there just yet (https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6877). \n\nIt's worth noting that  even if Atom were on the latest Electron, you will still need to build it yourself because it requires some other adjustments (see below). \n\n**Want to try it out?**\n\nMaybe it will _just work_ on your machine! I have a [gist with the steps](https://gist.github.com/jlord/7ffaf94d041982346934) to build. It involves using forks of both apm (Atom's package manager) and Atom so that you can build apm with [io.js](https://iojs.org) instead of Node.js since the later does not support ARM. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7822/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":2,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7821","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7821/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7821/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7821/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7821","id":94171334,"number":7821,"title":"Uncaught BufferedProcessError: Failed to spawn command `/usr/local/share/atom/atom`.
