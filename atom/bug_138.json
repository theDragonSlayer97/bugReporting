Description\n\nWhen searching in regular expression mode, some expressions ending in a zero-length assertion, match but do not actually replace.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create a new file containing:\n\n``` js\n//foo\n//bar\n```\n1. Find in `.*` (regular expression) mode either `//\\b` or `//(?=\\S)` and replace with any text replacement.\n2. Click Find, then Replace and Replace. Matches occur but replacements do not. \n3. Now search for `..\\b` and observe correct matches for `//`, `oo` and `ar` but only the latter get replaced.\n### Versions\n\n```\n> atom --version\n\nAtom    : 1.7.3\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n\n> apm --version\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.11\ngit 1.9.5.msysgit.0\nvisual studio 2013\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11688","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11688/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11688/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11688/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11688","id":152923342,"number":11688,"title":"Fixed open empty editor on start bug (issue #10623)","user":{"login":"Persing","id":14056163,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14056163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persing","html_url":"https://github.com/Persing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Persing/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722948,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":193722964,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/requires-changes","name":"requires-changes","color":"fef2c0","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-05-04T03:41:07Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T21:01:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11688","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11688","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11688.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11688.patch"},"body":"There seems to be a lot of confusion about the function of the \"Open Empty Editor On Start\" option in the settings. From what I was able to tell the intent of the option was to open a new blank file for editing if when Atom starts if there are no files open. In my build of the current master branch this option has no effect. I have modified the function according to these assumptions. Because many people expected this option to open Atom with all previously open files closed. With this demand in mind I made a new menu option for this feature. It works by closing all files that were to be reopened upon launching Atom. When Atom is closed is stores even the unsaved buffers, so on launch with this option checked it will still ask the user if they would like to save the file. \nHere is a link to a screen capture to demonstrate the way the bug fix and new feature work:

Download atom-windows.zip version 1.7.3 and extract the files to a folder.\n2. Open the command line and do one of the following:\n   1. Change to the directory where Atom was extracted.\n   2. Append the directory where Atom was extracted to the PATH variable.\n3. From the command line, run `atom.exe`\n\n**Expected behavior:** Atom should load without outputting any message to the command line.\n\n**Actual behavior:** A bunch of error messages are output to the command line.\n### Versions\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.7.3\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n```\n\nI believe the problem exists for all of the 1.7 versions.\n\n```\n'apm' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file.\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11685","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11685/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11685/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11685/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11685","id":152894573,"number":11685,"title":"Caching doesn't work on Travis OS X machines","user":{"login":"50Wliu","id":2766036,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2766036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu","html_url":"https://github.com/50Wliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98445015,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-03T23:07:46Z","updated_at":"2016-08-27T20:37:52Z","closed_at":"2016-08-27T20:37:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"(All prerequisites N/A)\n\nCaching takes longer than 180s on the OS X machines, which causes it to timeout.

Symbols are all global.\\n* Range for each occurence. Globals are provided in every file, file locals only in the file of origin and locals only in the code block where they were used. The code block consists of indented lines with an unindented line as the first line.\\n* It is an assignment or not. This info is used in go-to-definition.\\n* Any comment before the code block is attached to the first name after it.\\n\\n### Error reporting\\n\\nCurrently only indentation errors and bracket mismatches are reported.\\n\\n### References and definitions\\n\\nYou can open the reference view for any symbol or name. Put the cursor on it and select from the context menu`KDB-Q/Find references`or press <kbd>ctrl+shift+r</kbd>. The reference panel will appear, you can select any row or close it with the close button.\\n\\nYou can jump to the definition (assignment) of any name. Put the cursor on it and select from the context menu`KDB-Q/Find definition`or press <kbd>ctrl+alt+d</kbd>. If there are several definitions do this several times. After the last definition you will return to the original place.\\n\\n### QDoc support\\n\\nQDoc is implemented along JavaDoc and is compatible with the already existing QDoc schemas. All standard functions and .Q/.z functions are already documented.\\n\\nAll tags are mutiline except @name, @file, @see, @noautocomplete and @module. @module and @file are not supported atm. All QDoc lines should start with /, all\\nlines with more than one / are ignored allowing you to add private comments. The Q function or variable name should be on the next line after\\nthe comment block. Note that QDoc doesn't need the code to be correct.\\n\\nThe following tags are supported:\\n* @name Name - Alternative name for the QDoc entry.\\n* @desc text - Any html.\\n* @param Name TypeExpr text - Parameter 'Name' with type defined in 'TypeExpr', text can be any html.\\n* @key Name TypeExpr text - Key of a dictionary, should follow @param.\\n* @column Name TypeExpr text - Column of a table, should follow @param.\\n* @returns TypeExpr text - Description of the returned value.\\n* @throws Name text - Description of a possible exception. If there are several throws it is better to group them together.\\n* @example code - Any Q code, it will be shown as if in the editor itself (editor is not used though).\\n* @see name1 name2 ... - List of QDoc names, links will be added.\\n* @link as {@link link} or {@link Some descr|link} where link is either a foreign http(s) link or a QDoc name. It can be used inside @desc.\\n* @noautocomplete - suppress autocomplete for the current name. It can be used in general help articles.\\n\\nTypeExpr is type or (type name) or (type 1|type 2).\\n\\nExample:\\n``\\n/ The verb xkey sets the primary keys in a table.\\n/ The left argument is a symbol list of column names, which must belong to the table.\\n/ The right argument is a table. If passed by reference, it is updated. If passed by value, a new table is returned.\\n/ @param x (symbol|symbol list) Columns.\\n/ @param y (symbol|table)  Table to be keyed.\\n/ @returns (symbol|table) Table is keyed, what is returned depends on the second argument.\\n/ @example `sym xkey `trade\\n/ @see cols xcol xcols\\nxkey\\n``\\n\\nIf you press <kbd>F1</kbd> on xkey you'll see this:\\n![help](./resources/keyhelp.png)\\n\\nNote that QDoc also adds a link to the definition and allows you to request all references to the displayed name.\\n\\n## settings\\n\\nAutocomplete looks for`.autocomplete-kdb-q.json`file in each project directory. This file can contain some settings:\\n* includePaths - list of paths (relative or absolute) to include into this project.\\n* ignorePaths - list of paths (relative or absolute) to ignore.\\n* ignoreRoot - ignore all files or dirs in the project's root directory.\\n* ignoreNames - ignore these names (like \\\".svn\\\").\\n* cache - path (relative or absolute) where to save cached data to reduce the start time in large projects.\\n\\nExample:\\n``\\n{\\n  \\\"ignorePaths\\\": [\\\"node_modules\\\"],\\n  \\\"includePaths\\\": [\\\"C:\\\\\\\\somepath\\\\\\\\test.q\\\",\\\"C:\\\\\\\\somedir\\\"],\\n  \\\"ignoreNames\\\": [\\\"a2014.q\\\",\\\".git\\\"],\\n  \\\"cache\\\": \\\".cache\\\"\\n}\\n``\\n\",\"downloads\":396,\"stargazers_count\":1},{\"name\":\"autocomplete-xml\",\"main\":\"./lib/main\",\"version\":\"0.8.3\",\"description\":\"Autocomplete+ provider for XML via XSD\",\"keywords\":[\"xml\",\"xsd\",\"autocomplete\"],\"activationCommands\":{},\"repository\":\"https://github.com/pleonex/atom-autocomplete-xml\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"engines\":{\"atom\":\">=1.0.0 <2.0.0\"},\"dependencies\":{\"xml2js\":\"0.4.15\",\"uuid\":\"^2.0.1\"},\"providedServices\":{\"autocomplete.provider\":{\"versions\":{\"2.0.0\":\"getProvider\"}}},\"consumedServices\":{\"status-bar\":{\"versions\":{\"^1.0.0\":\"consumeStatusBar\"}}},\"readme\":\"# Autocomplete XML Atom Package\\n\\n![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/apm/dm/autocomplete-xml.svg)\\n![Version](https://img.shields.io/apm/v/autocomplete-xml.svg)\\n![License](https://img.shields.io/apm/l/autocomplete-xml.svg)\\n![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/pleonex/atom-autocomplete-xml.svg)\\n\\n\\nXML tag autocompletion for Atom text editor!\\n\\n![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pleonex/atom-autocomplete-xml/master/demo.gif)\\n\\n**NOTE:** The autocompletation feature is only available when:\\n* The XSD file follows the W3C standard.

See all open issues at [GitHub issues](https://github.com/keskiju/autocomplete-java/issues)\\n\\nOfficial page for package at atom.io: [autocomplete-java](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-java)\\n\\n## Preview\\n\\n![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/keskiju/autocomplete-java/master/screenshot.gif)\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nConfigure [classpath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classpath_%28Java%29) via a .classpath file. A simple project would typically contain a single .classpath file that is placed at the root directory of the project. A large project would contain a separate .classpath file for each module. An example of .classpath file contents:\\n\\n    ./classes:./lib/*:../api/classes\\n\\nThere is an example of multimodule classpath setup on [linter-javac Wiki](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-javac/wiki/classpathFilename#multiple-classpaths).\\n\\nYou can alter the default .classpath filename and other autocomplete behavior with package settings.\\n\\nNOTE:\\n* The package requires that either [JAVA_HOME](http://javarevisited.blogspot.fi/2012/02/how-to-set-javahome-environment-in.html) environment variable is set or JDK tools (javap, jar) are found in path. Alternatively you can set JAVA_HOME in package settings.\\n* The package requires compiled classes to function, but it does not compile classes from source. Use other tools for compiling.\\n* If you want autocomplete to show method argument names, compile your classes with the -parameters switch of Javac.\\n* If you compile classes manually, disable the 'refresh class on save' setting and run 'refresh project' manually after compilation (ctrl-alt-shift-R). Also try to avoid running refresh command and your build scripts at the same time.\\n* **Scanning all classes in classpath is still unoptimized. It might take a few minutes until autocomplete fully kicks in after opening a project, so please be patient.**\\n* **Class resolution for variables and method return values is still a quick hack and it will be improved in the future. If the package fails to resolve class automatically, you can still examine methods with a class name if you know the class yourself (e.g. ArrayList.con...).**\\n\\n## Tips\\n\\nAt first, compile all your classes using your favorite build tool, and start your app. While editing java source files, lint and compile changed classes automatically with [linter-javac](https://atom.io/packages/linter-javac), and the autocomplete-java package will refresh changed classes automatically on save. You can also reload changed classes automatically in JVM with [spring-loaded](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-loaded) or some other JVM agent. This way you can develop your app while the app is running.\\n\\nNOTE: Current version of linter-javac performs bad in case of slow hard drive and large amount of classes to be linted. If you experience freezing during file save, consider disabling linter-javac, at least for now.\\n\\nNOTE: Error in one class may prevent compilation of multiple classes. Therefore once you fix an error, multiple classes might be recompiled at once. So sometimes you might have to run 'project refresh' manually after you fix an error (ctrl-alt-shift-R). See issue [#19](https://github.com/keskiju/autocomplete-java/issues/19).\\n\\n## Contribute\\n\\nContributions are welcome.

What cool things can you expect?\\n  \\* Autocompletion of class members, built-in constants, built-in PHP functions, ...\\n  \\* Autocompletion of class names and automatic adding of `use` statements where needed.\\n  \\* Alt-clicking class members, class names, etc. to navigate to their definition.\\n  \\* Annotations in the gutter for methods that are overrides or interface implementations.\\n  \\* Tooltips for methods, classes, etc. that display information about the item itself.\\n  \\* IntellJ-style variable annotations `/** @var MyType $var */` as well as `/** @var $var MyType */`.\\n  \\* Shortcut variable annotations (must appear right above the respective variable) `/** @var MyType */`.\\n  \\* ...\\n\\n## What do I need to do to make it work?\\nCurrently the following limitations or restrictions are present:\\n  \\* You must use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for dependency management.\\n  \\* You must follow the PSR standards (for the names of classes, methods, namespacing, etc.).\\n  \\* You must write proper docblocks for your methods. There currently is no standard around this, but we try to follow the draft PSR-5 standard (which, in turn, is mostly inspired by phpDocumentor's implementation). Minimum requirements for proper autocompletion:\\n    \\* `@return` statements for functions and methods.\\n    \\* `@param` statements for functions and methods.\\n    \\* `@var` statements for properties in classes.\\n    \\* (Type hints in functions and methods will also be checked.)\\n\\nSome features may or may not work outside these restrictions. Composer is primarily used for its classmap, to fetch a list of classes that are present in your codebase. Reflection is used to fetch information about classes.\\n\\nThe package also requires a one time setup, To configure the plugin, click on \\\"package\\\" in your preferences, and select \\\"settings\\\" on atom-autocomplete-php plugin.\\n\\n- **Command to use composer** : it's highly recommended to write here the full path to your composer.phar bin. E.G on unix systems, it could be /usr/local/bin/composer. Using an alias is not recommended at all!\\n- **Command php** : Command to execute PHP cli in your console. (php by default on unix systems). If it doesn't work, put here the full path to your PHP bin.\\n- **Autoload file** : Write here, a coma separated list of all the different path to the autoload files. By default, it's \\\"vendor/autoload.php\\\" for composer projects ;)\\n- **Classmap files** : All paths to PHP files that returns an array of \\\"className\\\" => \\\"fullPath to the file where the class is located\\\". The default one for composer is vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php\\n\\nYou can test your configuration by using a command (cmd - shift - p) : `Atom Autocomplete Php : Configuration`\\n\\n### Linux\\n![Configuration](http://i.imgur.com/LYBcaHE.png)\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n### Windows (WAMP and ComposerSetup)\\n![Settings](http://i.imgur.com/hY5ypG2.png)\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n## Framework integration\\n  \\* [Symfony2 plugin](https://github.com/Peekmo/atom-symfony2)\\n\\n## What Does Not Work?\\n  \\* Most of the issue reports indicate things that are missing, but autocompletion should be working fairly well in general.\\n\\n### Won't Fix (For Now)\\n  \\* \\\"Go to definition\\\" will take you to the incorrect location if a class is using a method with the exact same name as one in its own direct traits. You will be taken to the trait method instead of the class method (the latter should take precedence). See also issue #177.\\n  \\* `static` and `self` behave mostly like `$this` and can access non-static methods when used in non-static contexts. See also issue #101.\\n\\n## What's Next & Contributing\\nKeep in mind that this plugin is under active development.

This is saved within a file in your projects root directory named`.ac-poly.json`. This file needs to built for each polymer project and updated when elements are changed or added (including bower components). It is recommended that the file is added to your`.gitignore`.  \\n\\nWhenever you need to build / update the autocompletion dictionary (`.ac-poly.json`) then run the`Update Project Completions Dictionary`command in the autocomplete-polymer package menu (`Packages  ->  Autocomplete Polymer`) in the top toolbar.  \\nYou can also call`Autocomplete Polymer:Update`from the command palette (`cmd + shift + p`) or use the keyboard shortcut`ctrl + alt + p`.\\n\\n### How it works\\nThe package builds a list of autocompletions by:\\n- Scanning your projects directory for all`js`and`html`files that are not within a folder named`test`or`demo`.\\n- then it searches through those files for the Polymer element registration calls (`Polymer({ is: '...'})`).\\n- The identified scripts containing the Polymer calls are then parsed and analysed by`esprima`such that we can pull out the elements names and a list of it's properties.\\n- A JSON object is written to the projects root folder which contains all the element names and the properties associated with those elements.\\n\\n### Important Notes\\n- Probably not compatible with atom projects which have multiple root folders.\\n- Will ignore any files placed within a`test`or`demo`folder.\\n- Only scans`js`and`html`files.\\n- Required to run the update command whenever there is a need to refresh the completions dictionary.\\n\\n### Recommended Packages for Atom\\n- For Polymer snippets check out: [atom-polymer](https://atom.io/packages/atom-polymer)  \\n- Html autocompletions: [autocomplete-html](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-html)  \\n- Automatic closing of html tags: [autoclose-html](https://atom.io/packages/autoclose-html)  \\n- File path autocompletions: [autocomplete-paths](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-paths)\\n- Html code linter: [linter-htmlhint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-htmlhint)\\n\\n\\n### Acknowledgements\\nThis project is a fork of the [autocomplete-html](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-html) project.  The project makes use of [scandal](https://github.com/atom/scandal) for directory scanning and file searching, [esprima](http://http://esprima.org/) for the javascript analysis and [estraverse](https://github.com/estools/estraverse) for the transversal of the abstract syntax tree.\\n\\n### Bugs, Improvements, Requests\\nPlease add an issue in the GitHub repository if you find any bugs, have improvement ideas, or requests.\\n\\n### Contributing\\nAny pull requests will be greatly welcome since I'm sure there is plenty of room for improvement.\\n\\n### Author\\nMark Silverwood\\n\",\"downloads\":2270,\"stargazers_count\":14},{\"name\":\"autocomplete-js-import\",\"version\":\"1.0.1\",\"description\":\"Autocompletes commonjs and es6 import statements\",\"main\":\"lib/index.js\",\"scripts\":{\"test\":\"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"},\"repository\":{\"type\":\"git\",\"url\":\"https://github.com/DanielGarcia-Carrillo/autocomplete-js-import.git\"},\"keywords\":[\"autocomplete\",\"atom\",\"es6\",\"es2015\",\"require\",\"import\"],\"author\":\"Daniel Garcia-Carrillo\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"bugs\":{\"url\":\"https://github.com/DanielGarcia-Carrillo/autocomplete-js-import/issues\"},\"engines\":{\"atom\":\">=1.0.0 <2.0.0\"},\"providedServices\":{\"autocomplete.provider\":{\"versions\":{\"2.0.0\":\"provide\"}}},\"homepage\":\"https://github.com/DanielGarcia-Carrillo/autocomplete-js-import#readme\",\"devDependencies\":{\"eslint\":\"^2.5.1\"},\"dependencies\":{\"lodash.uniq\":\"^4.2.0\"},\"readme\":\"# autocomplete-js-import\\nAutocomplete+ provider for JS import statements\\n\\nThis allows the completion of any files relative to the current directory.\\nAdditionally, there are settings to enable autocompletion of dependent packages found in the current\\nproject's root package.json file.\\n\\n![import local files screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanielGarcia-Carrillo/autocomplete-js-import/master/misc/autocomplete-screenshot.png)\\n\\n# TODO\\n* Changing settings doesn't do anything until atom restart\\n\\n# Wontfix issues\\n* Editing package.json dependencies doesn't reflect in suggestions until restart\\n  * Requires me to watch files which could be a heavy operation for large package.json\\n\",\"downloads\":540,\"stargazers_count\":0},{\"name\":\"autocomplete-abl\",\"main\":\"./lib/autocomplete-abl\",\"version\":\"0.1.2\",\"description\":\"Autocomplete-plus for OpenEdge ABL\",\"homepage\":\"https://github.com/tomasgreen/autocomplete-abl\",\"repository\":{\"type\":\"git\",\"url\":\"https://github.com/tomasgreen/autocomplete-abl.git\"},\"license\":\"MIT\",\"bugs\":{\"url\":\"https://github.com/tomasgreen/autocomplete-abl/issues\"},\"engines\":{\"atom\":\">=0.174.0 <2.0.0\"},\"dependencies\":{},\"providedServices\":{\"autocomplete.provider\":{\"versions\":{\"2.0.0\":\"provide\"}}},\"readme\":\"# autocomplete-abl\\nAutocomplete-plus for OpenEdge ABL\\n\",\"downloads\":229,\"stargazers_count\":1},{\"name\":\"autocomplete-php\",\"main\":\"./lib/main\",\"version\":\"0.3.7\",\"description\":\"Autocomplete-php is a PHP provider for autocomplete+\",\"repository\":\"https://github.com/Azakur4/autocomplete-php\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"engines\":{\"atom\":\">=0.174.0 <2.0.0\"},\"providedServices\":{\"autocomplete.provider\":{\"versions\":{\"2.0.0\":\"getProvider\"}}},\"readme\":\"# autocomplete-php package\\nAn Atom PHP autocompleter for`autocomplete-plus`\\n\\n**Now is mandatory have PHP in the enviroment PATH**\\n\\nBeta version.\\n\\n![Demo](https://raw.github.com/Azakur4/autocomplete-php/master/assets/img/demo.gif)\\n\\n### Requirements:\\n- Atom`autocomplete-plus`package\\n  - (instll with`apm install autocomplete-plus`)\\n- Now is mandatory have PHP in the enviroment PATH\\n\\n### Installation\\n-`apm install autocomplete-php`\\n- or install through Atom's UI\\n\\n### To-Do\\n- [x] Get local variables from current file\\n- [x] Get local functions from current file (Included snippets with params)\\n\\n### Maybe\\n- [ ] Update option for list of internal php functions\\n\\n### Thanks to:\\n- [@amp343](https://github.com/amp343) - Add snippets to php internal functions\\n- [@fbereche](https://github.com/fbereche) - Help me with some ideas in the new way to get autocomplete\\n\\n[![Share the love!](https://www.paypalobjects.com/pt_BR/BR/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=AMS87WQKEVEHG)\\n\",\"downloads\":44568,\"stargazers_count\":137},{\"name\":\"autocomplete-gml\",\"version\":\"0.1.4\",\"main\":\"lib/main.js\",\"description\":\"GML autocompletions in atom.

This package offers a fuzzy match function which is useful for uncertain words.\\n\\n这个插件需要提前安装[autocomplete-plus](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus) 和 [fuzzaldrin](https://github.com/atom/fuzzaldrin).\\n其中[fuzzaldrin](https://github.com/atom/fuzzaldrin) 是Atom的核心包，默认应该已经安装，[fuzzaldrin](https://github.com/atom/fuzzaldrin) 提供模糊匹配功能，对于不能准确记忆的单词非常有效。\\n\\n# Usage  使用\\nFor the defined file types, it will complete automatically. Like the figure shows below.\\n\\n对于默认设置中包含的文件类型，该插件将自动起作用，根据输入的英文字母提示匹配的单词，如下图所示。\\n\\n![A screenshot of the package using](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wushuaibuaa/autocomplete-en-cn/master/complete-en-cn-demo.gif)\\n\\n The default setting includes text file, latex file, markdown file, null grammar file. If you need to add your file type, add the type string in the setting panel.\\n\\n 默认设置的文件类型包括文本文件(.txt)，latex源文件(.tex)，markdown文件(.md)，无格式文件（无后缀）。如果需要添加另外的文件类型，将文件类型相应的字符串填入设置的框中即可。\\n\\n![A screenshot of the setting page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wushuaibuaa/autocomplete-en-cn/master/setting.png)\\n\\n\\nTo enable completion for your current file type, open one of the file and put your cursor in, open the Command Palette (cmd+shift+p or ctrl+shift+p), and run the: \\\"Log Cursor Scope\\\" command. This will trigger a notification which will contain a list of scopes. The first scope that's listed is the one you should add to the list of scopes in the settings for the package. Here are some examples: .source.gfm (markdown file), .text.plain (text file), .text.tex.latex (latex file).\\n\\n要了解文件对应的字符串，可以打开一个所希望的文件类型，然后在当前文件窗口下输入(cmd+shift+p or ctrl+shift+p)打开命令面板，输入\\\"Log Cursor Scope\\\" ，回车，就会弹出一个小的提示窗口，列出了文件类型对应的字符串，记录之后填入包的设置面板即可。\\n\\n# Acknowledgement\\nInspired by [autocomplete-APPLEASMx64](https://github.com/OrionNebula/autocomplete-APPLEASMx64).\\n\\n# License\\n[MIT](hhttps://github.com/wushuaibuaa/autocomplete-en-cn/blob/master/LICENSE.md) © [Shuai Wu](https://github.com/wushuaibuaa)\\n\",\"downloads\":22,\"stargazers_count\":1},{\"name\":\"autocomplete-nunjucks\",\"version\":\"0.5.0\",\"private\":true,\"description\":\"autocomplete+ provider for nunjucks\",\"main\":\"./lib/main.coffee\",\"scripts\":{\"test\":\"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"},\"repository\":{\"type\":\"git\",\"url\":\"git+https://github.com/puranjayjain/autocomplete-nunjucks.git\"},\"keywords\":[\"njk\",\"nunjucks\",\"autocomplete\",\"autocomplete-plus\",\"autocomplete+\",\"atom\",\"mozilla\"],\"engines\":{\"atom\":\">=0.174.0 <2.0.0\"},\"providedServices\":{\"autocomplete.provider\":{\"versions\":{\"2.0.0\":\"provide\"}}},\"author\":\"Puranjay Jain\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"bugs\":{\"url\":\"https://github.com/puranjayjain/autocomplete-nunjucks/issues\"},\"homepage\":\"https://github.com/puranjayjain/autocomplete-nunjucks#readme\",\"readme\":\"# autocomplete-nunjucks\\nAutocomplete+ provider for nunjucks templating engine for atom text editor\\n\\n## Language support\\nThe language support for package is at [language-nunjucks](https://github.com/alohaas/language-nunjucks)\\n\\n## Working sample\\n\\n![Screen gif 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puranjayjain/autocomplete-nunjucks/master/screengif/screen2.gif)\\n\\n## Special thanks to\\n\\n[language-nunjucks](https://github.com/alohaas/language-nunjucks) and their contributors.\\n\\n## Note\\nThis might break occasionally.

ERROR\nThe `Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library` kicks out an error upon adding a git repository with submodules as a project folder.\n\n<pre><code>Assertion failed!\n\nProgram: ...ed\\node_modules\\nodegit\\build\\Release\\nodegit.node\nFile: ..\\..\\vendor\\libgit2\\src\\submodule.c\nLine: 1673\n\nExpression: error !=

is trying to process the submodules in some way but then fails.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Install Atom using the windows installer from <a href=\"atom.io\">atom.io</a>\n2. Try to add a local git repo with submodules as a project folder.\n3. Read `Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library` errors.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Just add the repo and get on with it like it does with a normal repos.\n**Actual behavior:** nodegit errors out and causes atom to crash.\n### Versions\n\nAtom 1.7.3\nMicrosoft Windows 10 x86_64 (Upgraded from preinstalled Windows 7)\nAcer Aspire 5334 Laptop [_hardware list here_](http://www.lapspecs.com/detail/acer+aspire+5334)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11674","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11674/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11674/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11674/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11674","id":152675992,"number":11674,"title":"Visual Basic .NET syntax highlight","user":{"login":"CuteLeon","id":17419770,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/17419770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CuteLeon","html_url":"https://github.com/CuteLeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CuteLeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CuteLeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CuteLeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CuteLeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CuteLeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CuteLeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CuteLeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CuteLeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CuteLeon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-03T00:32:38Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T03:25:28Z","closed_at":"2016-05-03T03:25:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I need Visual Basic .NET syntax highlight!

Atom should not be able to get into this state.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Launch Atom\n2. Ensure there is only one pane in the window\n3. Press <kbd>Cmd+Alt+-</kbd> multiple times\n\n**Expected behavior:** Nothing to change\n\n**Actual behavior:** The pane area for the single pane shrinks even though the window does not change size\n###

Description\n\nI updated my package [language-markdown](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown) yesterday and I received the following issue report: https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/108\n\nI haven't heard back from @MGallow yet, but I'm relatively certain that the issue is related to what I've mentioned in my initial response to the issue report. **The underlying issue** (I think): Whenever I add a new option to `atom.config` in an update, this causes the package to malfunction when it is updated.\n\nI haven't experienced this issue on my development machine (because I think the new config item is already created during development), but I have seen it multiple times when updating on my secondary computer. Reloading Atom fixes the issue.\n### Prerequisites\n- I'm sure I can technically reproduce this, but it's quite the hassle. Each reproduction gives only a single opportunity to look at what's wrong. I'm also relatively certain (at least I hope so) my own code isn't the cause of these issues. See https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/blob/master/lib/main.coffee (L22-26 for config, L50-51 for subscriptions, and L166-180 for execution)\n- Atom v1.7.3 (detected on earlier versions too) on Mac OS X 10.11.4\n- Haven't found any relevant issues; search terms are rather generic.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4093","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"9D10:366F:BE3974:172CEC1:59D92926","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=139>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=137>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"5cec014b739c075b851304c689656203\"","status":"200 OK"}}
