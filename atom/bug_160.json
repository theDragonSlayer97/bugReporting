If you then type a `)`, this character is merged into the other one, so that you don't accidentally do this: `())`. This feature is available for `\"` as well.\n\nThis merging does not occur if a `)` or `\"` is typed directly after a backslash, which I assume is because a backslash is often used to escape these characters as literals. What doesn't make sense is that merging does not occur on the subsequent character, either: so typing `(\\z)` on your keyboard renders `(\\z))` in your file. This is especially annoying when it comes to strings, because something like `\"\\n\"` will become `\"\\n\"\"` unless the user is specifically wary of this bug.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a new file\n2. Type (as in, literally hit these keys) `(\\z)`\n\n**Expected behavior:** The file to contain `(\\z)`\n\n**Actual behavior:** File contains `(\\z))`\n### Versions\n\natom 1.5.3, apm
