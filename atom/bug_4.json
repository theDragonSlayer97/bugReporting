This also affects windows explorer. It gives an error that the folder cannot be renamed because it is in use by another program.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce found here: https://github.com/johnpyp/atom-canary-isolation\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Folder renames normally even if file is changed\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Folder (in Atom) does not have permission to change and (in explorer) doesn't get renamed due to \"the folder being open in another program\".\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% (3 tests so far, fairly thorough in terms of testing order of things and different operations to try to affect it. Two different folder and file structures analyzed to reproduce)\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nAtom    : 1.21.0-beta2\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\napm  1.18.5\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython\r\ngit 2.14.1.windows.1\r\nvisual studio\r\n\r\nTested on Windows 10 and Windows 7,  not sure what versions.\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nAny additional information, configuration or data that might be necessary to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Seems to be a long-standing bug in normal Atom too, just happens to be a case I have only really run in with using the Beta (though I do remember this error popping up in normal Atom).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15748","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15748/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15748/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15748/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15748","id":260802400,"number":15748,"title":"Unsigned Application Warning","user":{"login":"tedivm","id":121709,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/121709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedivm","html_url":"https://github.com/tedivm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedivm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedivm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedivm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedivm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedivm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedivm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedivm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedivm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedivm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-26T23:39:31Z","updated_at":"2017-09-27T06:05:56Z","closed_at":"2017-09-27T06:05:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When I downloaded the 1.20.1 version of Atom and attempted to install it over an existing install I got a warning from OSX saying that the application was unsigned.

Rename a file (.eslintrc => .eslintrc.bak)\r\n2. Make a soft link from a file from other place (ln -s /Users/baoquanyu/Documents/code/my/my_config_files/.eslintrc .eslintrc)\r\n3. Press `alt-cmd-i` to open the devTool\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** devTool open.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** It blocked and next time I relaunch it, it just crashed.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** One time, after that, every time I relaunch it, it will crash.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.21.0-beta1\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\napm  1.18.4\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 3.6.1\r\ngit 2.11.0\r\n\r\nSierra 10.12.6 \r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n#### screen snapshot\r\n<img width=\"471\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-09-24 at 12 32 09 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2340296/30779480-c640f530-a0b7-11e7-9850-48f9c0a04ad5.png\">\r\n\r\n**Atom**: 1.21.0-beta1 x64\r\n**Electron**: 1.6.9\r\n**OS**: Mac OS X 10.12.6\r\n**Thrown From**: Atom Core\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack Trace\r\n\r\nUncaught TypeError: this.childProcess.send is not a function\r\n\r\n```\r\nAt /Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/task.js:113\r\n\r\nTypeError: this.childProcess.send is not a function\r\n    at Task.module.exports.Task.send (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/task.js:113:33)\r\n    at Task.module.exports.Task.start (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/task.js:104:18)\r\n    at Function.module.exports.Task.once (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/task.js:23:24)\r\n    at Object.startTask (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/fuzzy-finder/lib/path-loader.js:24:31)\r\n    at Object.startLoadPathsTask (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/fuzzy-finder/lib/main.js:119:45)\r\n    at /Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/fuzzy-finder/lib/main.js:33:30\r\n    at _combinedTickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:67:7)\r\n    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:98:9)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commands\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Non-Core Packages\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### dump\r\n\r\n<details>\r\nProcess:               Atom Beta [78207]\r\nPath:                  /Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom Beta\r\nIdentifier:            com.github.atom\r\nVersion:               1.21.0-beta1 (1.21.0-beta1)\r\nCode Type:             X86-64 (Native)\r\nParent Process:        ???

It’s a half circle with > or < that allows one to toggle these panes.

It’s working correctly when the Atom interface is anything else except Maximized\r\n\r\nOn the Git Tab it does not show up when the tab is closed and one hovers close to the edge or on the edge AND the app window is maximized. It worked as expected when this feature first came available but the last 4, or so, updates it has not worked correctly. If I don’t have the editor sized maximized I can use it by hovering over the right edge of the editor. The half circle slides into view.\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.
