PR aims to improve the experience of running tests in Atom in a few ways.\n- Package authors will be able to specify an `atomTestRunner` field in their `package.json` containing a require path. If the field is present, Atom will resolve the path relative to the package's root, expecting the required module to export a function which it will invoke with an object containing the following parameters.\n  - `testPaths` An array of paths to tests to run. Could be paths to files or directories.\n  - `buildAtomEnvironment` A function that can be called to construct an instance of the `atom` global (it won't automatically be assigned to `global.atom`, that is left to the test runner to decide.\n  - `logFile` An optional path to a log file to which test output should be logged.\n  - `headless` A boolean indicating whether or not the tests are running headless.\n  - `legacyTestRunner` This function can be invoked to run the legacy Jasmine runner, giving packages a chance to transition to a new test runner while maintaining a subset of their tests in the old environment.\n- The test runner function will be expected to return a promise that resolves with an exit code. When tests are being run in headless mode Atom will exit with this code when the promise resolves. In interactive mode the promise will be ignored.\n- Running tests via the `atom` CLI has been streamlined. Simply run `atom --test path1 path2` to invoke the test runner on the listed paths, expanded relative to the working directory. The `--spec-directory` option will be deprecated.\n- The `buildAtomEnvironment` function will construct a clean Atom environment whose state can be reset via a call to `reset` in between test runs.\n\nRefs #8917\n/cc @bolinfest @maxbrunsfeld\n### Additional Thoughts\n\nAtom's current testing environment has been around since the very first day of Atom development, and is quite a mess. We assign all kinds of globals and mock the clock in evil and inconsistent ways that can cause quite a few headaches when writing tests for new packages.\n\nThis PR will give us a good way to make a fresh start. Ideally, a default test runner isn't something we should be supporting in Atom core. Every package should specify its preferred runner, which it can pull in as a development dependency and which Atom can interact with via an evolving interface. It would be good to have a recommended test framework. As it stands I'd probably want to switch bundled packages over to Mocha/Chai, unless people have other suggestions. Someday in the distant future we can finally delete the tangled mess that is our current default testing environment, but we'll keep it around for now.\n### Tasks\n- [x] Basic clean up around test window initialization\n- [x] Support specifying multiple test paths as arguments from the CLI.\n- [x] Support `atomTestRunner` field containing a path.\n- [x] Support multiple test paths in the default jasmine test runner.\n- [x] Clean up Atom environment construction so we can instantiate the Atom environment without assigning to globals.\n- [x] Pass `buildAtomEnvironment` to test runners and use it to assign the `atom` global in the default test runner, rather than in the test window initialization script.\n- [x] Rename `Atom` to `AtomEnvironment`\n- [x] Add a `reset` method to Atom environment\n- [x] Pass `legacyTestRunner` parameter.\n- [x] Fix docs generation.\n- [x] Drop the `--spec-directory` CLI option\n  - [ ] Stop using `--spec-directory` in `apm test` (https://github.com/atom/apm/pull/445)\n  - [x] Stop using `specDirectory` parameter when running tests interactively\n- [x] Drop the `Run All Tests` command from Atom since it's broken.\n- [x] Shim `process.stdout.write` and `process.stderr.write` in the test window\n- [x] Support a timeout flag\n- [x] Expect the test runner to return a promise\n- [x] Update packages to not use deprecated methods\n  - [x] https://github.com/atom/welcome/pull/39\n  - [x] https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview/pull/316\n  - [x] https://github.com/atom/language-php/pull/105\n  - [x] https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/pull/592\n  - [x] https://github.com/atom/snippets/pull/176\n  - [x] https://github.com/atom/autosave/pull/49\n  - [x] https://github.com/atom/tabs/pull/214\n  - [x] https://github.com/atom/language-javascript/pull/239\n  - [x] https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/pull/551\n  - [x] https://github.com/atom/language-c/pull/93\n  - [x] https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/pull/552\n  - [x] https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/pull/144\n- [x] Add user-facing documentation for the new workflow and options \n- [x] Move remaining uses of APIs that interact with main process such as `ipc` to methods on `ApplicationDelegate`\n- [x] Assign the `defaultTarget` of the keymaps in the `AtomEnvironment` constructor.\n- [x] Parameterize the `configDirPath` and don't attempt any disk I/O in `Config` or `AtomEnvironment` if it is undefined.

It seems as though Atom naïvely calculates `N` as two separate characters. I would expect Atom to treat it as a single character. However, I understand that some might not agree.\n<img width=\"945\" alt=\"early soft wrapping\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/997507/10106444/51c972f8-637a-11e5-9d34-62c637c75156.png\">\n\nAdditionally, if one resizes the window appropriately, they can see that the second code point in `N` can be separated and wrapped independent of the first code point, as shown in the following image. Obviously, Atom does not do this for `O`.\n\n<img width=\"845\" alt=\"soft wrap separating code points in a code sequence\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/997507/10106742/117551ca-637c-11e5-9490-367e4ff38fb7.png\">\n\nThis lack of canonical equivalence can also be demonstrated via the search feature, as shown in the following images. Neither `N` is considered a match for `O` nor vice-versa. Atom should either match all characters that have that code point in the code sequence or all characters whose entire coded character sequence is a match. In regard to the third following image, I do not currently have a guess as to what could cause the depicted result.\n\n<img width=\"894\" alt=\"searching for N\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/997507/10106588/359570b8-637b-11e5-9288-ae5c89f4a042.png\">\n\n<img width=\"894\" alt=\"searching for O\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/997507/10106592/390bdc28-637b-11e5-8dac-04c1910af496.png\">\n\n<img width=\"894\" alt=\"searching for “a”\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/997507/10106809/700da12e-637c-11e5-9a24-90666e558725.png\">\n\nIn regard to a fix for this bug, note that the following code sequences, though visually `Q = S ≠ R = T = U`, are in fact all considered canonically equivalent.\n- `Q = (U+0061, U+0301, U+0305)` should render as ā̇\n- `R = (U+0061, U+0305, U+0301)` should render as ǡ\n- `S = (U+0101, U+305)` should render as ā̇\n- `T = (U+0227, U+0301)` should render as ǡ\n- `U = (U+01E1,)` should render as ǡ\n\nNote that `R` does not render correctly, as shown in the following image. Upon initial research, this seems to occur for all characters in which the subsequent code points in the corresponding code sequence are not in ascending order.\n\n<img width=\"386\" alt=\"improperly rendering R\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/997507/10107806/12ebae1c-6383-11e5-9854-eb7de7e3d78d.png\">\n## Compatibility Issue\n\nCompatibility comes into play for characters that might have distinguishable appearances but have the same meaning. Compatible characters are not necessarily canonically equivalent, but canonically equivalent characters are always compatible (as I understand).\n\nConsider the typographic ligature “ﬀ” (code sequence `(U+FB00,)`). The string “ff” (code sequence `(U+00FF, U+00FF)` is compatible with the ligature. However, in this particular case, care should be taken to not consider them compatible if the latter one is followed by a combining character.\n\nNote that compatible sequences shouldn't _always_ necessarily be treated the same way. It depends on the situation.\n## Similar Issues\n\nThis appears to be related to #1783, but based on my findings, these appear to be separate bugs. #1783 appears to be caused by inconsistent character widths in the font. This issue differs in that code points are not being properly combined. It appears that there are many duplicates of #1783 that are unrelated to this issue. Some of the duplicates even initially appear similar to this one.\n\nAt first glance, this appears related to #1894, but I do not believe that they are related in any way.\n\nThere seem to be many issues related to this, but none touch on the underlying problem of this one: Unicode equivalence.\n## Closing Remarks\n\nA partial solution would be to normalize the underlying representation of the text. Users might expect the coded character sequences to not be modified (i.e. normalized), so that could potentially introduce some challenges, particularly in terms of memory usage.\n\nA fix should only be effective for Unicode codings. At the time of this writing, the only supported Unicode encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16 BE, and UTF-16 LE.\n\nSince this is a silent, semantic issue, there are no error reports to include.\n\nAll of the screenshots and described behavior are from Atom 1.0.15 on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5. No changes to the UI (e.g. switching themes, directly modifying the theme, etc.) seem to affect any of the aforementioned issues.\n\nMore information in regard to the Unicode aspect can be found in [“Chapter 3” of _The Unicode Standard: Version 7.0 – Core Specification_](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch03.pdf). Additionally, an overview can be found on the [“Unicode equivalence” article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4924","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"B3F4:366F:BEEF70:1742B72:59D92A83","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=229>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=227>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"df330b1443fda6202e67f072d394cbc2\"","status":"200 OK"}}
