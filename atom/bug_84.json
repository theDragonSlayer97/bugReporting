What I see as a problem (I understand this is not a bug, but a implementation decision, though IMO it would be better to change it) is that when Atom is not able to create an IPC socket (or on any other significant, though not critical error), it silently ignores the error and continues as if everything was OK. Then we observe a degradation in user experience without understanding the real cause. In my case it was that Atom was not detecting correctly that there was already a running instance so it was creating a new window for each new file opened externally (via shell/cli). Though, it does create an error file ~/.atom/nohup.out with the following content:\r\n\r\n```\r\nApplication server failed { Error: listen EACCES ~/.tmp/atom-1.12.3-userx.sock\r\n    at Object.exports._errnoException (util.js:1008:11)\r\n    at exports._exceptionWithHostPort (util.js:1031:20)\r\n    at Server._listen2 (net.js:1240:19)\r\n    at listen (net.js:1289:10)\r\n    at Server.listen (net.js:1378:5)\r\n    at AtomApplication.module.exports.AtomApplication.listenForArgumentsFromNewProcess (/opt/atom/resources/app.asar/src/main-process/atom-application.js:282:14)\r\n    at AtomApplication.module.exports.AtomApplication.initialize (/opt/atom/resources/app.asar/src/main-process/atom-application.js:120:12)\r\n    at Function.module.exports.AtomApplication.open (/opt/atom/resources/app.asar/src/main-process/atom-application.js:59:38)\r\n    at App.<anonymous> (/opt/atom/resources/app.asar/src/main-process/start.js:68:21)\r\n    at emitTwo (events.js:111:20)\r\n    at App.emit (events.js:191:7)\r\n  code: 'EACCES',\r\n  errno: 'EACCES',\r\n  syscall: 'listen',\r\n  address: '~/.tmp/atom-1.12.3-userx.sock',\r\n  port: -1 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a comparison (and this is how the error was discovered) Visual Studio Code (which is also node-based) reports the error on initialization and fails to start.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13325","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13325/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13325/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13325/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13325","id":191609244,"number":13325,"title":"Open folder not shown and text on open files are erased after machine reboot","user":{"login":"ShanikaEdiriweera","id":10475891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10475891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShanikaEdiriweera","html_url":"https://github.com/ShanikaEdiriweera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShanikaEdiriweera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShanikaEdiriweera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShanikaEdiriweera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShanikaEdiriweera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShanikaEdiriweera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShanikaEdiriweera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShanikaEdiriweera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShanikaEdiriweera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShanikaEdiriweera/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":372218233,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/data-loss","name":"data-loss","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":505038679,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2016-11-25T01:23:14Z","updated_at":"2017-09-20T18:36:39Z","closed_at":"2017-09-20T18:21:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nOpen folder not shown and text on open files are erased after machine reboot.\r\nFortunately when I close the files it prompts to save.

However in the tree-view and settings panel the scrolling works as expected, but in the editor window the scrolling only works if i scroll faster. The scrolling behaviour in the tree-view and settings panel is the same as in the rest of the system (like in the Finder, Chrome, etc.)\r\n\r\nI've recorded a video to demo it:\r\n\r\n[www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA6kkavus5E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA6kkavus5E)\r\n\r\nI know that there's a setting for the scroll sensivity and I've played around with the value, but it didn't help.\r\n\r\nWe've tested it on 3 Mac System which all do have this problem and on a Linux machine, where it seems to work fine. The Linux machine has the same mouse as one of the the Mac systems.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom\r\n2. Open a project with long files and a large filetree\r\n3. Move the mousewheel very slightly in the editor view and compare it to the scrolling in the tree-view\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The scrolling should be similar in every view.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The scrolling in the editor view differs from the other views.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nOS      : macOS 10.12.1\r\nAtom    : 1.12.5\r\nElectron: 1.3.9\r\nChrome  :

it does result in the shell exiting as expected without consuming 100% of a CPU core\r\n  * Adding `detached: true` to the options used for `child_process.spawn` _does_ fix the issue and retains the desired behavior, but it requires additional code to manage the process lifecycle if Atom exits or an Atom window is reloaded while the shell process is still running\r\n\r\nThe below is a copy of https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13084#issuecomment-262507036, included here to open up a new issue:\r\n\r\n@phw says:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nI debugged this a bit and can reproduce it with the following test script (extracted from [src/update-process-env.js](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/1b2d2f029945c58cf4cd474ef1423856b35cf26c/src/update-process-env.js)):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst childProcess = require('child_process')\r\nconst cmd = 'command env'\r\nconst shell = process.env.SHELL  // zsh or bash doesn't matter, behavior is the same\r\n// const shell = '/bin/bash'\r\n\r\nconst child = childProcess.spawn(shell, ['-ilc', cmd], {\r\n   encoding: 'utf8',\r\n  //  detached: true,\r\n  stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', process.stderr]\r\n})\r\nchild.on('error', (e) => {\r\n  console.log('error', e)\r\n})\r\nchild.stdout.on('data', (data) => {\r\n  console.log(data.toString('utf8'))\r\n})\r\nchild.on('close', (code, signal) => {\r\n  console.log('close', code, signal)\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nLaunching this directly from a shell works, even if I set an empty environment like so:\r\n\r\n    env -i SHELL=/bin/bash node spawn.js\r\n\r\nLaunching the same from a desktop file in Gnome 3.22 leads to the shell task endlessly consuming 100% of CPU. I used the following desktop file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Desktop Entry]\r\nName=Spawn Node Test\r\nExec=env SHELL=/bin/bash node /home/phw/devel/spawn.js\r\nIcon=atom\r\nType=Application\r\n```\r\n\r\nTwo things help to solve this issue:\r\n\r\na) Enable `detached: true` when spawning the child process\r\nb) Remove the `-i` flag from the shell call\r\n\r\nI think b) would actually be correct anyway, since this is in no way an interactive shell.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just to be clear: I still don't know exactly *why*  this is happening, I just know the issue can be circumvented removing the `-i` flag.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13316","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13316/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13316/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13316/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13316","id":191331421,"number":13316,"title":"Autocomplete behaviour","user":{"login":"Aggroblut","id":5066584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5066584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aggroblut","html_url":"https://github.com/Aggroblut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aggroblut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aggroblut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aggroblut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aggroblut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aggroblut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aggroblut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aggroblut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aggroblut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aggroblut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-11-23T17:09:55Z","updated_at":"2016-11-25T17:10:17Z","closed_at":"2016-11-25T17:10:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\n![2016-11-23](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5066584/20571418/a97e3b4c-b1a7-11e6-999f-b109e09a412d.GIF)\r\n\r\nMay my way to use autocomplete is retarded.

The edit tool do not support the hotkey \"ALT+mouse drag\"  and \"CTRL+mouse drag\", \"ALT+mouse drag\" should be able to select the same column from different rows which is Adjacent, besides, editing the same column(identical) can not affect the content behind the edit place.the Effects as notepad++.\r\n3.
