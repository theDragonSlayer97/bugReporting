reproduce:\nCreate a project on a drive that is not able to send deleted files to the trash, either because it does not have permissions or is not the owner.\nOpen project in Atom.\nAttempt to delete file from tree view. No error will be thrown, file will remain.\nAtom is however able to delete from projects located on drives that can access the trash.\n\nRunning version 1.0.4\nUbuntu 15.04\n\nWould it be possible for Atom to give the option to permanently delete the file? If not, would it be possible for Atom to throw some kind of even generic error, so it doesn't appear that deletion itself is broken in the app?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9181","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9181/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9181/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9181/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9181","id":111918353,"number":9181,"title":"Make Error.prepareStackTrace read-only (again)","user":{"login":"maxbrunsfeld","id":326587,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/326587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-10-16T21:58:04Z","updated_at":"2015-10-16T23:46:07Z","closed_at":"2015-10-16T23:46:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/9181","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9181","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9181.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9181.patch"},"body":"Stack traces were incorrect for babel-compiled JS files again, because the require order had changed such that coffee-script once again clobbered our Error.prepareStackTrace.

It seems like nearly all of these issues could be solved by a couple things:\n1. Create all tabs as 'permanent' by default and only open in a preview tab in a couple cases:\n   - Single clicking in the tree-view\n   - Single clicking in project find results pane\n   - And eventually (when open files is suuuper fast) opening preview tabs when arrowing through the fuzzy finder\n2. Close the preview tab when it loses focus\n\nThe issues\n- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/170\n- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/206\n- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/202\n- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/196\n- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/180\n- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/173\n- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/170\n- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/164\n- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/207\n- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/163\n- https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/issues/108\n## The short term approach\n\nCurrently preview-tabs is implemented entirely in the tabs package. When a new pane item is opened, the tabs package closes the old pane item associated with the preview tab, and creates a new tab. So atom core (or other packages) has no idea that there are preview tabs. This is kind of crappy as\n- There are hacks in the tabs package to handle things like double clicking in the tree view to make a tab permanent.\n- There is no way for other packages to open preview tabs, or even know about them without accessing the tabs package\n- Along the same lines, a couple folks want an API, and the only way to provide an API would be to add a service or hack to the tabs package.\n  - https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/188\n  - https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/185\n\nThat said, we could probably do a quick fix to change the default behavior to open a 'permanent' tab, and hack the other packages to open preview tabs in the exceptions listed above.\n## The long term approach\n\nA cleaner and more robust approach would be to bake the notion of a preview pane item into atom core. Packages could then decide to open preview items if they so choose. Then there would be no hacks: tree-view and the find results could open a preview item on single click; tabs could watch for preview items and have them all share one tab element.\n\n@nathansobo @maxbrunsfeld not sure how much effort this longer term approach would be. Can you estimate how long it would take to add a new option to `open()` indicating the notion of a preview pane-item + related events?\n\ncc @atom/feedback\n\n_Copied from original issue: atom/tabs#218_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9165/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9164","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9164/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9164/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9164/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9164","id":111685617,"number":9164,"title":"Fix auto update UX","user":{"login":"benogle","id":69169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle","html_url":"https://github.com/benogle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":163641905,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/atom","name":"atom","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":246604266,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/auto-updater","name":"auto-updater","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":35,"created_at":"2015-10-15T19:04:41Z","updated_at":"2017-08-23T16:37:39Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Our automatic update process is pretty bad.

What's up?\n- Atom restarts again after 5 - 15 seconds\n- Notice that the release notes are up in the reloaded window. They are still out of date, and still have the 'Restart and Update' button showing and enabled\n- Notice that the squirrel icon is still showing, and still blue, with the same tooltip text\n- I click the squirrel because it's still there, and not going away. It focuses the release notes. Ok.\n- I'm thinking: is there another update??!? What is happening?\n- I check the atom menu\n  - Click the 'About' item, theres no information saying it's the latest version\n  - I notice there is a version number, and a 'Check for update'\n  - Nothing indicates I'm at the latest version\n- On reload, squirrel goes away; still nothing tells me I'm at the latest version.

of considering every character to have the same width when we perform soft-wrapping, we now make a distinction between default characters, double width characters, half width characters and Korean characters .\n\nThe strategy consists in measuring these kinds of characters once when sampling font styles and then using the calculated width to find where a certain line wraps.\n\nPlease, note that this won't work with non-monospaced fonts, but it's consistent with how we currently handle soft-wrapping for latin characters.\n\n/cc: @nathansobo @maxbrunsfeld
