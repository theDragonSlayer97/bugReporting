The following snipplets are from the latest git build (latest commit: bc0e5ad4c33c1a72470680b3478715513b6c0b46).

(BTW: The .deb distributed via the official website is also affected). Compared these two debs with  the deb from 0.193 the file is there (atom-0.193-deb-content.txt). \n\nFor me it looks like, as if something in the build process is broken and it would be cool to have a working editor back :-) \n![Uploading Bildschirmfoto von »2015-04-29 22:01:17«.png…]()\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6617","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6617/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6617/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6617/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6617","id":72708954,"number":6617,"title":"An idea for easing the coming deprecation apocolypse","user":{"login":"mark-hahn","id":811455,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/811455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-hahn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-05-02T22:29:34Z","updated_at":"2015-05-06T19:26:45Z","closed_at":"2015-05-06T19:26:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have an idea for reducing the number of deprecations that make it to June 1.
