But when trying to do an interactive rebase the editor crashes after input or delete 4 letters (number of letters inputted can vary depending on cursor position). I can navigate fine with the arrow keys, so it's not keypresses that trigger this but rather modifying the displayed text.\n\nCopy / Cut works fine, but pasting causes the crash. Sometimes I can paste 1 time and the crash happens, sometimes I can go up to 3 times. The number of times I can paste something stays consistent when I paste the same thing at the same position.\n\nTried rebasing another repository, I had to copy paste a line ±10 times to reproduce\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Set atom as git editor\n2. Do an interactive rebase \n3. Type a couple of things\n4. Watch atom crash\n\n**Expected behavior:** Nothing, I would expect the text to be entered normally and no crash\n\n**Actual behavior:**  Crash\n### Versions\n\n```\n$ atom --version\n1.5.4\n\n$ apm --version\napm  1.6.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.10\ngit 2.5.4\n```\n\nOS X El Capitan v10.11.3\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11154","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11154/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11154/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11154/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11154","id":140536217,"number":11154,"title":"Deleting project folder causes path to change to the directory one level above","user":{"login":"dkulakov2014","id":14017602,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/14017602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulakov2014","html_url":"https://github.com/dkulakov2014","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulakov2014/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulakov2014/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulakov2014/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulakov2014/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulakov2014/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulakov2014/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulakov2014/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulakov2014/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulakov2014/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-03-13T22:21:55Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T20:11:15Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T20:11:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi all,\n\nI'm trying to fix a bug related to issue #10212 on how atom handles project paths.\n### Description\n\n If you delete a folder that is open as a project and then close and reopen atom, the project path changes to the directory one level above the deleted folder instead of just removing the project path altogether.\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1) Create a folder in your desktop, populate it with some random files.\n2) In atom, select the option to add the project folder to the workspace.\n3) Manually delete the project from your desktop.\n4) If you close and reopen atom, the project folder will be gone, but in its place atom will include the directory one level above it (in this case, the Desktop).\n\nIn my mind, deleting the folder you were working on should not make atom choose to open another directory in its place, which could cause all sorts of problems if you unintentionally modify it. I'm hoping to change it so that when a folder gets deleted, all links to the folder and its files will be removed from the workspace.\n### Versions\n\n1.6.0-dev atom\napm  1.6.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.6\ngit 1.9.1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11153","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11153/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11153/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11153/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11153","id":140531096,"number":11153,"title":"Fix node env","user":{"login":"lee-dohm","id":1038121,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1038121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm","html_url":"https://github.com/lee-dohm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-03-13T21:23:26Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T17:17:50Z","closed_at":"2016-03-14T16:35:43Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11153","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11153","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11153.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11153.patch"},"body":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11054 wasn't preserving the `NODE_PATH` environment variable when the `process.env` was changed.

(folder) that open views with a very limited width, see screenshots below (taken in SAFE MODE).\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open [my setup repo](https://github.com/MoOx/setup) (not sure if that's related to some local cache). **Note that this only happen in this folder** (from what I see), didn't find any other yet).\n2. Open a new document (cmd+n) or about or settings page\n\n**Expected behavior:** Normal (full) view width, with correct tab visibility\n\n**Actual behavior:** View/tabs are not visible as they used to be\n\n_Screenshots taken in safe mode_\n\n![screen shot 2016-03-13 at 06 34 51](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/157534/13727146/fff9d3da-e8e6-11e5-8e4e-088105cffdf5.png)\n![screen shot 2016-03-13 at 06 35 00](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/157534/13727148/0002249a-e8e7-11e5-9b6a-9253f1e60c00.png)\n![screen shot 2016-03-13 at 06 35 12](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/157534/13727147/fffd3ec6-e8e6-11e5-8082-72c0951ce0c3.png)\n\nHere is a detailed view. I don't see anything that might take some space here\n\n![screen shot 2016-03-13 at 06 47 01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/157534/13727163/7aeae02a-e8e7-11e5-931a-b29ef82121f3.png)\n\nIs there a way I can find some local cache about the opened folder to see if that can fix the issue?\n**I previously installed nuclide**, so maybe that is related ?\nThis bug did not happened when I installed nuclide, but some days after, after I changed some nuclide  config. I disabled nuclide and a lot of plugin, reverted my atom config (from the one versionned in setup repo) and still have the issue in safe mode.\n### Versions\n\n❯ atom --version\n1.5.4\n\n❯ apm --version\napm  1.6.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.10\ngit 2.7.2\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11147","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11147/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11147/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11147/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11147","id":140449883,"number":11147,"title":"Something broke Atom","user":{"login":"PierBover","id":226483,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/226483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover","html_url":"https://github.com/PierBover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-03-13T05:17:16Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T22:08:39Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T22:08:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I was working with Atom and then I noticed a keyboard shortcut wasn't working.

the last week or so Atom has stopped working on my Windows 10 machine. I use the same packages/extensions as on my mac machine and that's working fine, so I don't think it's a package problem.\n\nThe Editor loads but appears blank. Once I resize the window the black editor screen appears along with the tabs of opened files from my last session/project. But nothing responds.\n### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)\n  Yes it happens in Safe Mode. Here's the output:\n\n[http://resource-centre.net/files/atom-error.jpg](http://resource-centre.net/files/atom-error.jpg)\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n  Yes.\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging)?\n  I can't load any of the config screens, but the menus appear.\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n  I think so.\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n  Yes, different people have different causes/solutions.\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\n[Description of the bug or feature]\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. [First Step]\n   Load Atom in Windows. 10\n2. [Second Step]\n   Nope that's it!\n3.
