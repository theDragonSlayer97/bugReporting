I don't know if this Enhancement Suggestion belongs in atom/atom or in atom/language-ruby.  I do suspect that this enhancement also applies to other languages such as Python, Perl, etc., not exclusively to Ruby; given its display-oriented nature, it does seem (to me) to be Atom/core rather than syntax/language- (Ruby-) dependent.\n2. See attached screenshots for comparison between what Sublime Text 3 does and what Atom does not yet do... but should.  These two screenshots show exactly the same file/lines of code in both Atom and in Sublime Text.  The Atom screenshot was taken in v1.1, but the same behavior exists in v1.3 (my current Atom).\n3. In Ruby (also in other languages), a constant (or variable) can be declared as at Line 31 (in both screenshots), for example a constant ESC (an \"Escape\" character code) which has a single character code (integer) value.  Other instances of this sort of thing would include CSI (Control Sequence Introducer), SI (Shift-In), SO (Shift-Out) char-code values, etc.\n\nOnce declared, Sublime Text will render a graphic, e.g., a reverse-video'd \"ESC\" wherever that character-code value occurs in subsequent character strings... Atom does not.\n\nSee Lines 32--59 for the Sublime Text screenshot, which clearly shows \"ANSI Escape Sequence\" strings of characters (including in comments!) -- the corresponding lines in the Atom screenshot do not, thus implying that these \"ANSI Escape Sequence\" characters strings are malformed and missing the leading ESC character.\n1. Suggestion/request is to enhance Atom (or syntax/language packages, especially Ruby) to recognize such character-code constants (&/or variables) and render them visibly as part(s) of character strings where these occur (mimicking Sublime Text in this regard).\n2. My environment/versions:\n   $ atom -v\n   1.3.0\n   $ uname -a\n   Linux alikot 3.13.0-74-generic #118-Ubuntu SMP Thu Dec 17 22:52:10 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n3. Sample screenshots: Atom (#1) and Sublime Text (#2)\n   ![rubyconstants-in-atom-v1-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1362449/12023462/f1c5de60-ad56-11e5-8c99-181fed03082f.png)\n

The suggestions move out of view (as I expected them to) only after going past the end of the bottom-most pane.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n- **1)** Have panes open in the editor arranged similarly to the ones in the image below.\n\n![Panes](http://i.imgur.com/UzlEnjS.png)\n- **2)** Enter part of a tag, selector, etc. etc. and let autocomplete suggest the rest of it for you in its tab.\n- **3)** Scroll with the mousewheel. The autocomplete tab will move in the unwanted way.\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nI expected the autocomplete tab to move out of view, while staying inside the correct pane, when scrolling out of view, and to be viewable again once I got back to where the suggestions originated. \n\n[Here's a GIF showing this issue.](https://imgur.com/EKTaHQD)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10191","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10191/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10191/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10191/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10191","id":123958239,"number":10191,"title":"atom doesn't save last session on Windows 10","user":{"login":"cuteUser","id":16449061,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16449061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuteUser","html_url":"https://github.com/cuteUser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuteUser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuteUser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuteUser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuteUser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuteUser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuteUser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuteUser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuteUser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuteUser/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-12-27T03:38:04Z","updated_at":"2015-12-27T04:22:58Z","closed_at":"2015-12-27T04:22:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I installed save-session package\nI checked autosave enabled\nI checked save-session enabled \nBut my atom doesn't save last session.

However, performance, especially UX performance has always been the major factor stopping me from switching from ST (I am guessing that I am not alone in this)\n\nAnd at the moment it seems like VS Code has the edge in that respect. Its editor has better performance compared to Atom.\n\nFor example, when I test the _Find_ command in  this file: https://github.com/YemSalat/spark-lang/blob/master/src/parser/parser.js\n\nAnd search for things like 'peg', 'this', etc. A clean install of Atom takes between _1s - 1.5s_, while VS Code does it almost instantly (I would say no more then _250ms_). It is also much better at 'live-updating' the search results as you are typing. I am testing this on a 3 year old i5 8GB laptop.\n\nI think looking into their implementation could be helpful, as in my opinion improving editor performance can highly increase the editor adoption rates among developers who have not made the switch yet.\n\nPS The VS Code editor can be found here: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/src/vs/editor\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10188/reactions","total_count":70,"+1":65,"-1":2,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10187","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10187/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10187/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10187/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10187","id":123947547,"number":10187,"title":"Atom has strange redrawing issues on my machine","user":{"login":"a-vasyliev","id":1255946,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1255946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-vasyliev","html_url":"https://github.com/a-vasyliev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-vasyliev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-vasyliev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-vasyliev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-vasyliev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-vasyliev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-vasyliev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-vasyliev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-vasyliev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-vasyliev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193717188,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/blocked","name":"blocked","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-12-26T20:39:01Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T21:09:18Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T21:09:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, \n\nI've issues with latest Atom release on my Dell Inspiron 7548 (4k display).
