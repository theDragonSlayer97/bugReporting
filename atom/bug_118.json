As of right now, there are a few things that need to be dealt with before that can happen.\n\nThe primary problem is that as of Electron v1.1.0, Node.js was upgraded to v6 and that causes some issues. ~~I believe (and hope) that the only major issue is the usage of older version of graceful-fs in a few of our dependencies. Once those have been resolved, I think we'll be able to sort out the remaining issues in Atom core without too many problems.~~ OK, there are more problems than first anticipated — I'll keep updating the task list below as I identify (and fix) problems.\n\nThere is another concern though, since Electron v1 removed some [deprecated module `require` bits](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/5373).\n\nI propose that in this PR, we perform the upgrade process in stages, one minor version bump at a time, to minimize the number of issues and hopefully keep it reasonable.\n\n---\n- [x] Upgrade to v1.0.x\n- [x] Upgrade to v1.1.x\n  - [x] Resolve breaking changes to `path` module.

[x] Fix use of removed `ATOM_SHELL_INTERNAL_RUN_AS_NODE` env variable in `exports/atom.js`\n  - [x] Fix beforeunload handler to conform to new contract\n  - [x] Open issue on atom-package-deps (https://github.com/steelbrain/package-deps/issues/57)\n- [x] Upgrade to v1.3.x\n  - [x] Upgrade oniguruma to work with Node 6\n  - [x] Upgrade marker-index to work with Node 6\n  - [x] Investigate why `atom-pane-resize-handles` are positioned incorrectly, making it impossible to resize panes with the mouse.\n- [x] Add deprecated shims for legacy electron APIs (where feasible)\n- [x] Open issues on packages that use removed Electron APIs that we aren't able to shim (because they involve methods called on remote proxy objects).\n  \n  APIs:\n  - `remote.require`\n  - `WebContents.prototype.loadUrl` (renamed to `loadURL`)\n  - `WebContents.prototype.getUrl` (renamed to `getURL`)\n  \n  Packages:\n  - [x] atom-cos-studio (https://github.com/MDevelopmentGroup/Atom-COS-Studio/issues/35)\n  -

too many times spent far too long (and even given up) trying to find grammar names. Sometimes `.source` comes before the language; sometimes after. For some reason HTML has `.basic`.\n\nThere's no clear pattern to follow, and the status bar will only give what we probably already know - e.g. `YAML`.\n\nEven hunting through the developer tools will only give you the attributes e.g. `source` and `yaml` - not an order.\n\nThis could be fixed just by documentation, but ideally I think it would be great to see something like a 'tooltip' on hover over the current grammar/button to open selector that's in the lower left. So it would still say \"YAML\", but if I hovered a small \".source.yaml\" would appear.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12287","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12287/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12287/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12287/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12287","id":168921812,"number":12287,"title":"Uncaught

the dev tools open) with an unsaved editor will reload to an empty window because of:\n\n```\nUncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'bufferId' of

to Reproduce\n1. Using either Atom 1.9.0 or Atom 1.10.0-beta0 (in safe mode or not), have an unsaved editor and no project\n2. Press `ctrl+opt+cmd+L`,\n3. Reload to a blank screen (check the console for the error),\n4. Press `ctrl+opt+cmd+L` to re-reload,\n5. Works again.\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\n\nFor the `ctrl+opt+cmd+L` reload to work fine the first time.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\n\nHad to reload twice because the first time throws an error that leaves Atom in an unusable state.\n### Versions\n\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.\n\nAtom 1.9.0 and Atom 1.10.0-beta0, on macOS 10.11.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12279","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12279/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12279/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12279/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12279","id":168770802,"number":12279,"title":"atom 1.9 autocomplete position not correct ,just look at the picture as below","user":{"login":"toplinuxsir","id":1111353,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1111353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toplinuxsir","html_url":"https://github.com/toplinuxsir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toplinuxsir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toplinuxsir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toplinuxsir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toplinuxsir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toplinuxsir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toplinuxsir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toplinuxsir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toplinuxsir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toplinuxsir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-08-02T00:09:19Z","updated_at":"2016-08-03T01:03:51Z","closed_at":"2016-08-02T16:09:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1111353/17312826/54d39cea-5888-11e6-842a-dd9e51578ebf.png)\n### Prerequisites\n- [ ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [ ] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [ ] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [ ] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [ ] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\n[Description of the bug or feature]\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.
