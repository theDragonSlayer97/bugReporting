#15037.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo overcome issues with npm 5.2, https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15004 and https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15014 configured the build process to use npm 5.1. That change resolved the issues we were seeing with the AppVeyor build [A], but it unintentionally introduced a problem for anyone attempting to build Atom with Node 8.\r\n\r\nWhile the [CI builds use Node 6.9.4](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/3d02234cbdf701a851d9b1239d67dcdbc8808146/circle.yml#L19-L20), we aim to support [Node 6 or newer](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/d61967bff479acbdc6216dc9618879ebe8d23910/docs/build-instructions/macOS.md#requirements). However, pinning npm to 5.1 causes problems when trying to build with Node 8 [B].\r\n\r\nTo resolve the original problems that we were addressing in https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15004 and https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15014, _and_ to restore support for building Atom with Node 8, this PR updates the build to use npm 5.3. The CI builds still use Node 6.9.4, but you should be able to build locally with Node 6 or newer once this PR is merged.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[A] Example AppVeyor build failure prior to pinning npm version: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Atom/atom/build/7267/job/3narmqtij0sgb28f\r\n\r\n[B] Example Circle CI build failure using npm 5.1 and Node 8.1.4: https://circleci.com/gh/atom/atom/4364\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15040","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15040/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15040/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15040/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15040","id":243340999,"number":15040,"title":"Addinitsoftwarp","user":{"login":"joy1305","id":4591953,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4591953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joy1305","html_url":"https://github.com/joy1305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joy1305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joy1305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joy1305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joy1305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joy1305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joy1305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joy1305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joy1305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joy1305/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-07-17T09:38:12Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T09:40:22Z","closed_at":"2017-07-17T09:38:33Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15040","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15040","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15040.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15040.patch"},"body":"add init soft warp","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15039","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15039/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15039/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15039/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15039","id":243318896,"number":15039,"title":"Linux closing tab with middle mouse pastes text in next tab","user":{"login":"nebularazer","id":10167277,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10167277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebularazer","html_url":"https://github.com/nebularazer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebularazer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebularazer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebularazer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebularazer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebularazer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebularazer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebularazer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebularazer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebularazer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-17T07:54:11Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T14:41:46Z","closed_at":"2017-07-17T14:41:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Install `atom-beatify`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nNo glitching.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nGlitching.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\nAlways, but actual glitch trigger is obviously complex because it's not readily predictable.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom 1.19.0 - 1.19.4\r\n \r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThe pattern of the glitches look like the have the footprint of various element redraws.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15031","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15031/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15031/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15031/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15031","id":243175374,"number":15031,"title":"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'firstChild' of undefined","user":{"login":"VB-is-Terrible","id":12043629,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12043629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VB-is-Terrible","html_url":"https://github.com/VB-is-Terrible","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VB-is-Terrible/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VB-is-Terrible/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VB-is-Terrible/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VB-is-Terrible/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VB-is-Terrible/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VB-is-Terrible/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VB-is-Terrible/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VB-is-Terrible/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VB-is-Terrible/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-07-15T13:28:18Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T23:08:58Z","closed_at":"2017-07-18T23:08:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce:]\r\n\r\n1.

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n<head>\r\n    <title></title>\r\n    <style type=\"text/css\"><![CDATA[\r\n        html {\r\n            font-size: 13pt;\r\n        }\r\n

with Atom.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** It shouldn't get stuck, and the highlighting should be correct.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The whole UI gets stuck for a long time, after that the highlighting is incorrect.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Always\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom 1.18.0 on macOS
