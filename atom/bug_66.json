Now that I am back using it again, I tried testing this in Atom --safe mode and noticed something else. It appears to happen only in Mixed mode (see screenshot below). Mixed mode regarding CR / LF characters, you can see this on the file details on the bottom right in the screenshot.\r\n\r\nYou can also see when I copied the text from the Mixed mode XML file that it only copied the first character. I used the exact same example XML file as I originally attached to this issue.\r\n\r\nAnd then I used a sample XML file using CRLF mode (Download from here: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/simple.xml). I was able to copy the text fine with this example, but not with the above example.\r\n\r\nI wonder also, the encoding type set in the above XML is UTF-16, yet Atom reports it as UTF-8. Maybe it is having an issue reading the characters because of this?\r\nIt could also be the Mixed mode?\r\n\r\n![atom safe mode test](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17824719/23263757/1d27f80e-f9d7-11e6-91cf-51377690f7cf.jpg)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13870","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13870/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13870/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13870/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13870","id":209774636,"number":13870,"title":"Hard Crash on Win10-64 at Toggle Full Screen (F11)","user":{"login":"KlugB","id":25726929,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/25726929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlugB","html_url":"https://github.com/KlugB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlugB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlugB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlugB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlugB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlugB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlugB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlugB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlugB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlugB/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":153145129,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/crash","name":"crash","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-02-23T14:24:11Z","updated_at":"2017-02-25T18:08:14Z","closed_at":"2017-02-25T18:08:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

I am trying to extend an extension that does some things with project paths, and I've narrowed my troubles down to this method. I've hacked the extension that I'm working on so that when I run an atom command, it executes this line of bash script (This is actually a bit of coffee):\r\n```\"gnome-terminal -e \\\"bash -ic \\'echo #{atom.project.getPaths().shift()} && read -s -n 1 line\\'\\\"\"```\r\nIt's a little complicated, with a number of escape sequences, so I'll explain it here.\r\nThe ```gnome-terminal``` command runs all of the following using the -e option (this also works with xterm, although I've set my personal (and hacked) copy to gnome, since I prefer it).\r\n```bash``` is run so that the terminal actually shows up, rather than just running without opening a gui at all. This corresponds to the read statement at the end (see below)\r\nThe ```echo``` bit is just the bit that I hacked so that it would print the string it's supposed to be cd'ing to instead of trying, failing, and closing. Eventually it will cd to that path, and then execute something in there, but that isn't particularly relevant.\r\n```read``` (and all of it's args) is so that the terminal stays open so that you can see the output. \r\n\r\nThis all works great, I can see the output of getPaths() just fine. The problem is the output itself: ```undefined```. Removing the .shift() property makes the method return nothing at all. I'm wondering if anyone else is having this problem (all platforms, I'm curious), and wondering why I'm having this issue (I am restarting atom every time I edit the file...).\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a package that executes that bit of coffee when you run a certain atom command.\r\n2. Run the command in atom. Ideally, you'll end up with a terminal with the output to your current project directory.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** I want it to spit out the project I'm currently working in.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** It prints ```undefined```\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% of the time this is the case. I am led to believe that this is not the case on other platforms.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```atom --version```:\r\nAtom    : 1.14.2\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```apm --version```:\r\napm  1.15.3\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.11+\r\ngit 2.7.4\r\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, I'm running a release version of Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS 64 bit.

There are some problems with this:\r\n\r\n- It's not the native text cursror - looks out of place\r\n- It doesn't scale well - the first image below is the default cursor, with macOS cursor scaling enabled. The second shows the native OS text cursor (pixellated..). The native cursror was scaled correctly as a vector but the screenshot tool for some reason renders it at the normal 1x size (just imagine it scaled properly :))\r\n\r\n![cursor-img](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4211302/23124134/4f4b3998-f763-11e6-9534-90431208c23e.png)\r\n\r\n![cursor-reg](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4211302/23124137/55d5812e-f763-11e6-9f83-e5fcbe1fa98d.png)\r\n\r\nFix is to use something similar to this: \r\n\r\n```css\r\natom-text-editor.editor .scroll-view {\r\n    cursor: text;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Hover over a text field\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Cursor should be native text cursor, should scale with accessibility settings\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Cursor is a custom raster image - therefore becomes pixellated when scaled\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> atom-beta --version\r\nAtom    : 1.15.0-beta3\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.\r\n```\r\n\r\nmacOS sierra 10.12.3","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13851","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13851/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13851/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13851/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13851","id":208748492,"number":13851,"title":"Don't let run atom as root","user":{"login":"pabloab","id":657836,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/657836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloab","html_url":"https://github.com/pabloab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-02-19T21:38:24Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T21:13:34Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"In particular for experienced users is [pretty known](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10566#issuecomment-278616243) they shouldn't run atom as root, not only for problems this make on .atom folder but also because of security issues.
