now an again when I use the `atom` command line tool to open a directory in Atom it starts a new process instead of opening it in the already running process.\n\nI don't see any pattern to it, more than that the first time it happens Atom has been running for hours, maybe days. If I just do `atom .` in two different directories after each other it opens in the same process, just as expected. Maybe it's just that I notice it more often when I get back to the computer in the morning or after I haven't used it for a long time, but it seems to happen more frequently in those cases.\n\nHere's two Atom processes in my Dock just now, one of them contains the projects I was working in yesterday, and one of them contains a project that I just opened through `atom .`.\n\n<img width=\"178\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-10-12 at 08 23 03\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/73330/10422429/88e58bbc-70ba-11e5-9fd9-939ef3a768b4.png\">\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9117/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9116","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9116/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9116/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9116/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9116","id":110912183,"number":9116,"title":"Source maps are broken in the debugger on Windows","user":{"login":"ForNeVeR","id":92793,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/92793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForNeVeR","html_url":"https://github.com/ForNeVeR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForNeVeR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForNeVeR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForNeVeR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForNeVeR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForNeVeR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForNeVeR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForNeVeR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForNeVeR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForNeVeR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-10-12T05:46:08Z","updated_at":"2015-10-13T07:38:52Z","closed_at":"2015-10-13T07:38:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1.
