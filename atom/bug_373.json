Could it be possible to implement system window title bar/borders hiding like Chromium/Chrome has?\n\nIf you have used Chromium/Chrome you can notice it lacks the \"system window title bar\" by default (ie, the bar that says the name of the window and has the minimize, maximize and close buttons), while at the same time providing its own tiny minimize, maximize and close buttons in the top, rightmost part of the window.\n\nSome window managers for Linux let you hide the window title bar, but since Atom lacks its own minimize/maximize/close buttons, it becomes inconvenient. Besides, it would be something nice to have in Windows/OSX too.\n\nIMHO, this feature manages to save (precious!) vertical space, and looks much more pleasant.\n\nEDIT: Made a discussion thread about this https://discuss.atom.io/t/hide-system-window-title-bar/14578\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4599/reactions","total_count":74,"+1":70,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4598","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4598/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4598/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4598/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4598","id":51887778,"number":4598,"title":"Font problem: letters are too close to each other.","user":{"login":"Qws","id":3944421,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3944421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qws","html_url":"https://github.com/Qws","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qws/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qws/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qws/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qws/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qws/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qws/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qws/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qws/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qws/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":18,"created_at":"2014-12-13T13:28:59Z","updated_at":"2015-02-02T11:24:36Z","closed_at":"2014-12-16T01:19:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3944421/5423852/131b1ade-82d4-11e4-9623-26f402ffa1bc.png)\n\nI can't change this, no matter what font-family I choose, it stays like this, it's not fun to read code like that...
