So, the `Grim.deprecate` call within `ContextMenuManager.add()` catches both calls to `ContextMenuManager.add()` from packages (adding menu items after activation) and calls to `ContextMenuManager.add()` from Atom when it adds menu items from packages' cson file at activation.\n\nFor that reason, the `Grim.deprecate` call in cases when `ContextMenuManager.add()` is called from Atom at package activation is incorrectly attributed to Atom itself. Also, the deprecation text is a bit confusing because it says that `ContextMenuManager.add()` was called, but the package didn't make such a call directly.\n\nThis PR adds a new `Grim.deprecate` call to `Package.activateResources()` _before_ `ContextMenuManager.add()` is called. This catches the old-context-menu-CSON-format situation so that it is correctly attributed to packages and a clearer message can be shown. In addition, the conversion from the old format to the new format happens in `Package.activateResources()` as well so that the `Grim.deprecate` call within `ContextMenuManager.add()` isn't triggered in that case. The `Grim.deprecate` call within `ContextMenuManager.add()` wasn't removed because it still needs to catch direct calls to that public method from packages.\n\nBefore (call attributed to Atom):\n\n![screen shot 2015-04-26 at 11 08 40](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/38924/7337875/dcd9a894-ec39-11e4-98e5-ca53684b6ed2.png)\n\nAfter (call attributed to package + a bit more direct deprecation message)\n\n![screen shot 2015-04-26 at 11 11 41](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/38924/7337876/e1267b48-ec39-11e4-97e2-c39a08d4ed1f.png)\n\nDoes this approach look okay?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6521","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6521/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6521/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6521/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6521","id":71114832,"number":6521,"title":"Integration tests failing","user":{"login":"brettle","id":118192,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/118192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle","html_url":"https://github.com/brettle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98407029,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/build-error","name":"build-error","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-04-26T20:19:10Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T23:57:54Z","closed_at":"2016-05-05T23:57:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Are the integration tests just generally broken at the moment or should I expect them to work? \n\nHere's what I get:\n\n```\n[brettle@localhost atom]$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/google/chrome ATOM_INTEGRATION_TESTS_ENABLED=true /home/brettle/apps/atom/share/atom/resources/app/apm/bin/apm test\n[13254:0425/215459:ERROR:browser_main_loop.cc(170)] Running without the SUID sandbox!

using [coffee-compile](https://atom.io/packages/coffee-compile) plugin to compile *.coffee files on save. Unfortunately, it does not provide options to choose where to store compiled files. It just creates *.js file near the original coffee one. If directory has over 10 coffee files, sidebar will be messed with 20 files (10 pairs, 1 coffee and 1 js for each pair), that may disturb the developer.\n\nIt would be nice if Atom has option to hide *.js file if there's *.coffee file with the same name. It may look like coffee file with dropdown arrow, js file is shown as subtree by click. It works the same way in JetBrains WebStorm.\n\n![screen shot 2015-04-25 at 14 38 10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3099788/7332802/b9eb46d2-eb5b-11e4-9747-41c155c41150.png)\n\nAnother approach is to use `coffee-script` tool directly, compiling app to separate directory `./build`, but it has two major issues:\n- you always need to have another terminal session started\n- this ruins one-window Atom workflow\n\nSo, is there any exiting plugin that may do the trick?\n\nThank
