I've used Bootstrap on other projects, and really enjoyed having some baseline styles for forms, typography, etc. So far, everything has been super custom so this hasn't come up, but for something like a configuration UI it makes total sense to build on an existing vocabulary.\n\nThe main downside is that we're now _normalizing_ the styles of basic elements instead of resetting them completely. But I actually see this as an upside in certain situations. It's easy to zero out styles when they aren't wanted, but harder to supply basic styles over again every time you want elements to look halfway decent.\n\nI realize this decision may be controversial, so what I'd like to do is live with Bootstrap for a while and see how it feels. If it causes problems, we can rip it out. If a designer crafts something better suited to our needs that's better, we can switch. But for now, I want _something_. I imagine we'll end up thoughtfully diverging from it over time, and developing our own vocabulary. But having something to grow off of is a win. Most of its styling is completely opt-in, aside from its default styling of various elements such as headers, but those are really easy to opt out of. I can easily see thoughtfully forking it over time, but I think it gives us a good starting point for a solid CSS vocabulary.\n\nThis PR also introduces improvements to our LESS infrastructure, allowing `@import` directives to function properly. It introduces an `octicon-mixins.less` file that makes it dead-simple to apply icons to any element with a mixin, like so: `.mini-icon(octocat)`. Also, where I needed to fix styling that was slightly incompatible with Bootstrap, I took the opportunity to convert CSS files to LESS syntax and clean them up.\n## To Do\n- [x] Editor renders cleanly\n- [x] Fix tree view styling\n- [x] Fix tabs styling\n- [x] Fix styling of the test runner\n- [x] Fix styling of the mini editor, it looks whack\n- [x] Get specs passing\n- [x] Make precompilation work\n- [x] Enable the rest of bootstrap stylesheets\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/498","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/498/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/498/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/498/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/498","id":13175562,"number":498,"title":"Add API documentation for src/app","user":{"login":"gjtorikian","id":64050,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/64050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjtorikian","html_url":"https://github.com/gjtorikian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjtorikian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjtorikian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjtorikian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjtorikian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjtorikian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjtorikian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjtorikian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjtorikian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjtorikian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2013-04-14T17:13:57Z","updated_at":"2013-04-19T01:58:42Z","closed_at":"2013-04-19T01:58:41Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/498","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/498","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/498.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/498.patch"},"body":"This is an initial drop of API documentation for _/src/app_. Future drops in different branches will cover _/src/packages_ and _/src/stdlib_.\n\nAs discussed in #222, I'm using [Biscotto](https://github.com/gjtorikian/biscotto) here. Biscotto relies on TomDoc notation for classes and methods. It'll parse your set of files, creating an internal AST, then generate documentation from that. GFM is supported, and you can do [simplified linking](https://github.com/gjtorikian/biscotto#automatically-link-references) to other parts of the code.\n\nAt the end, you get a neat summary:\n\n```\nParsed files:            53\nClasses:                  51 ( 31 undocumented)\nMixins:                    0\nNon-Class files:        3\nMethods:                  1133 (545 undocumented)\nConstants:                0 (  0 undocumented)\n 51.35% documented\n 0 errors\n```\n\nThose are actual results--this PR is currently covering 51% of _src/app_.\n\n---\n\nYou can find a list of what's remaining by running `biscotto --listMissing ./src/app/`. The majority of stuff that's not listed is simply stuff I didn't understand. For example:\n- I'm not really clear on how markers work--and the distinction between buffer-markers and display-buffer markers. Do they just define the start/tail and end/head of a selection?\n- Does anything in _atom-package_, _atom-theme_, or _atom_ need to be marked as `Public`?\n- I'm not sure what `LineMap` does.\n- I skipped a majority of the `LanguageMode` / grammar stuff since I'm not sure if that ought to be marked public either. Would people want to mess with the tokenization?\n\nI'll try to find one of you this week to answer some questions about how some of these internals work? Or should some of them indeed be simply `Internal`?\n\nSome other assumptions:\n- In most cases, I marked `constructor`, `initialize`, and `destroy` as `Internal`. I used my best judgement here. For example, a user would probably never initiate a new `Fold`--they'd use `createFold` instead.\n- By the same logic, _serialize_ and _deserialize_ are marked `Internal`. My understanding is that these are called internally so there's no need to run them by yourself.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/497","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/497/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/497/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/497/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/497","id":13163590,"number":497,"title":"Better cursor movement with line wrap behavior","user":{"login":"watsonian","id":244,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/watsonian","html_url":"https://github.com/watsonian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watsonian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watsonian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watsonian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watsonian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watsonian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watsonian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watsonian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watsonian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watsonian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-04-13T21:55:41Z","updated_at":"2014-01-17T01:00:13Z","closed_at":"2014-01-17T01:00:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In situations where you have line wrapping enabled and a \"real line\" is spanning more than one \"virtual lines\", there should be a way to easily get to the end of the virtual line as well as the real line.\n\nGiven this scenario:\n\n```\n+this is a line with a=\nsoft line wrap that=\nspans multiple=\nvirtual lines\n```\n\nwhere the = is a soft line wrap and the + is the cursor, you should be able to easily get to the end of line 1 or line 4.

we're mixing a Node-style synchronous require model with a lot of JavaScript that was designed to run into the browser, we often need to modify scripts that expect certain global variables to be present. For example, jQuery UI expects jQuery to be available in its global namespace, and fails when we require it currently.\n\nIt would be nice if we could somehow supply a hash of \"globals\" that we close over when evaluating scripts that we require, like this:\n\n``` coffee-script\njQuery = require \"jquery\"\nrequire \"jquery-ui\", { jQuery }\n```\n\nAny free-variable references to jQuery would then be resolved to the passed-in object. One issue with this is the following: what happens when you call require again with different values for the same variables. Should we return the cached value? I'd say we make the caching conditional on the value of the variables, or just throw an exception if it's called a second time with different values. This would also require some modification to Node.\n\nI'm not totally sure it's a good idea, but it might be a nice general solution to what will likely be a very common problem in the early years of Atom. If we become popular enough, people will start writing their JS libraries to run in both modes, but until then it would be nice to have something to help us paper over the awkwardness.\n\n@zcbenz

Work in Progress :rotating_light:\n\nGetting nicer, now that I can utilize bootstrap styles for the forms / nav:\n\n![Screen Shot 2013-04-17 at 2 04 57 PM](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1789/393527/d8e19e44-a79a-11e2-8166-7a0728d20f54.png)\n## To Do\n- [x] List available packages and allow them to be disabled with checkboxes\n- [x] List available themes and allow them to be dragged into an enabled themes list\n- [ ] List editor for the ignored names array\n- [ ] UI to customize the invisible characters\n- [x] Improve the layout\n- [ ] Make a light / dark theme for config\n- [ ] Add a button to open the `~/.atom` directory\n- [ ] Editor for the user stylesheet\n- [ ] Keymaps editor\n## Description\n\nNow, when you press `meta-,`, instead of just loading your `.atom` directory we will load a custom configuration interface. It will contain various panels, some added by the core system and others added by packages that have `activateConfig` methods in their main modules. The forms read/write to/from the `config` global, and other windows detect the user's `config.cson` changing and reload the config automatically.\n\nThere's the beginnings of a rudimentary bindings system for form fields. You can give a form field a `name` and a `type` attribute that binds it to a config field. So an input element with a name of `editor.fontFamily` will automatically display and update that key path in the config.\n\nIt's also worth noting that it took a bit of trickery to get the form fields working properly. This may be of interest to @jbarnette, who ran into similar issues. There's a custom `native!` binding that you can assign in they keymap. If any element ever matches that binding, we will immediately abort processing in the keymap and let the browser handle the keypress as normal. I applied this binding to input elemetns that don't have the class of `hidden-input` for the arrow keys, tab, backspace, etc to allow them to function as normal. It just seems like overkill to always use editors instead of form fields. For simple interfaces, a form seems fine to me. And it will blend in better with select menus, etc.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/489","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/489/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/489/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/489/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/489","id":12943420,"number":489,"title":"Support back-references in `s/` substitution commands","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-04-08T20:46:51Z","updated_at":"2013-12-02T22:43:35Z","closed_at":"2013-09-19T19:06:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Currently you can only supply a whole string.

changing the name of a feature flag from `addons_area_enabled` to `addons_store_enabled`, and noticed a small bug in the project-wide search. I had modified the feature flag in the main file (but not yet saved that change to disk), and proceeded to do a project-wide search for where that feature flag was used. The results contained the unsaved modification, despite it not matching the searched-for-text:\n\nI’m imagining what’s happening here is that the search finds a match in the file as it exists on disk, but Atom displays that result with the unsaved modification in place of the actual match. I’m not entirely sure what _should_ happen here, but it certainly created a moment of uncertainty in my mind about why a result was turning up that I didn’t search for. Probably the best thing to do would be to show the matched result as it appears on disc, and have a \"unsaved changes\" label or something next to the filename in the result list? I don’t really know :confused:
