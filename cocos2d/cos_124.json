issue is very similar to #14623, but can be solved independently. \n\nCurrently it's impossible for the `SIODelegate` to distinguish if the client has sent a plain string or a serialized (JSON)

data.c_str());\n}\n```\n\nThe log will contain:\n\n```\nGOT test-str \"string\"\nGOT test-obj {\"type\":\"obj\"}\n```\n\nA possible solution for this could be to add another parameter to `fireEventToScript` indicating that `data` contains a serialized JSON object:\n\n``` c++\nvoid ServerImpl::fireEventToScript(cocos2d::network::SIOClient* _client, const std::string& event, const

it's not possible to emit JSON with the native implementation of SocketIO. \n\nWith the official JS client I can emit JSON like:\n\n``` js\nio.emit('infos', { name: 'hans' });\n```\n\nAnd this is what the server will receive. \n\n```\nengine:ws received \"42[\"infos\",{\"name\":\"hans\"}]\"\n```\n\nThe cocos2dx implementation only supports `std::string` as argument and this:\n\n``` c++\nclient->emit(\"infos\", \"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"hans\\\"}\");\n```\n\nWill lead to:\n\n```\nengine:ws received \"42[\"infos\",\"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"hans\\\"}\"]\"\n```\n\nThis is a bit annoying, as, on the server, I need to call `JSON.parse` manually **AND** the server is no longer compatible with both the official JS client and the cocos2dx client (one backend for ios/android apps and html5). \n\nA possible solution for this could be to emit full `rapidjson` (already included in cocos2dx) objects:\n\n``` c++\nvoid SIOClient::emit(const std::string& eventname, const rapidjson::Document& json);\n```\n\nAnd/or a new method that allows the user to construct the JSON string manually:\n\n``` c++\nvoid SIOClient::emitJson(const std::string& eventname, const std::string& json);\n```\n\nI think the best solution would be to implement both new methods, because:\n- `emitJson` would be the fastest solution with 100% control for the user (craft the json string by hand vs construction a `rapidjson` object)\n- `emit + rapidjson` is a very nice addition that does no harm\n\n**NOTE**: As soon as we implement #14619, we should support JSON objects there too. Please have a look [at this example](https://gist.github.com/michaelcontento/b1b9d7cf18b8c30f6bad) to see what is possible with the official JS client/server. Those are the features that one might expect from the native SocketIO client too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14622","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14622/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14622/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14622/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14622","id":121185801,"number":14622,"title":"CCEAGLView
