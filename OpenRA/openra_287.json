This leads to an interesting scenario where you could just build a building and then sell it to free up space in silos without any cost. In the original games, this would prevent you from building any more buildings. However, now we have two types of build queues that mostly negates this disadvantage.\n\nInstead of draining ore silos as buildings and units are built, what if materials are only drained if buildings are built and units are completed? This would make the old method of freeing up silo space useless, and in addition, make silos more useful by raising the spending cap.\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/2470676-idea-instead-of-directly-draining-materials-from-silos-drain-materials-when-construction-is-completed?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5533","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5533/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5533/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5533/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5533","id":34808315,"number":5533,"title":"Build ontop of resources?

If you don't check the return result your array will only be partially filled and bad things happen.\n\nReadBytes was broken and would throw an EndOfStreamException if the count was anything less than the requested number. If the count was non-zero then this is a bogus exception and results in traces like in #5520, #5580.\n\nReadAllBytes was broken and wouldn't even do you the good graces of throwing an exception. Instead it'd hand you back a partially filled array and let you choke later on all the zeros at the end of the array you weren't expecting. PrepareMap called this method so you would get traces like in #2441, #4135, #4357.\n\nPersonally I didn't know file streams did this (I never checked but I assumed this was something more intended for network streams and stuff) but today I learned that they do.
