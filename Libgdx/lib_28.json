See also [this answer on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36298111/is-it-possible-to-use-sun-misc-unsafe-to-call-c-functions-without-jni/36309652#36309652).\n\nThis PR shouldn't break any code.\nCritical natives have been tested on Mac OS X 64bit, Linux 32 and 64bit, Windows 32 and 64bit.\n# How to use\n1. Ensure that your method can be used as a critical native. This means that it is **static**, **non-synchronized** and only has **primitives** or **primitives arrays** as arguments.\n2. The method also can not use the normal `JNIEnv*` or  `jclass` arguments\n\nSupport for critical natives has to be _explicitly_ added.\nSo for example, if we have this method:\n\n``` java\nprivate static native void foo(int anInt, float[] anArray); /*\n  foo(anInt, anArray);\n*/\n```\n\njnigen would create this:\n\n``` c\nJNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_[package]_[class]_foo(JNIEnv* env, jclass clazz, jint anInt, jfloatArray obj_anArray)\n{\n  float* anArray = (float*)env->GetPrimitiveArrayCritical(obj_anArray, 0);\n  foo(anInt, anArray);\n  env->ReleasePrimitiveArrayCritical(obj_anArray, anArray, 0);\n}\n```\n## **That's is the way it currently works.**\n\nThis PR adds support for generating critical natives.\nTo do so, we have to add a new (java) method:\n\n``` java\nprivate static native void foo_JNICritical(int anInt, int anArrayLength, float[] anArray); /*\n  foo(anInt, anArray);\n*/\n```\n\nthis method is then used for generating a critical native, so it becomes this:\n\n``` c\nJNIEXPORT void JNICALL JavaCritical_[package]_[class]_foo(jint anInt, jint anArrayLength, jfloatArray anArray)\n{\n  foo(anInt, anArray);\n}\n```\n## **What changed compared to the non critical version:**\n\nCompare:\nNormal version:\n\n``` java\nprivate static native void foo(int anInt, float[] anArray);\n```\n\nvs.\nCritical version\n\n``` java\nprivate static native void foo_JNICritical(int anInt, int anArrayLength, float[] anArray);\n```\n1. A critical version has the same name plus `_JNICritical` to identify it as a critical native.\n2. You **have to** add a new parameter of type `int` before every primitive array.\n   The parameter contains the length of the primitive array. \n   **If you don't do this your critical native will probably _not_ be called!**\n# Which functions benefits from it\n\nFunctions that do relatively little work in the native code benefit from it, since the jni overhead is greatly reduced.\nThat's why the various methods of `Matrix4` (`mul`, `rot`, ...),which all need to pass primitive arrays, are about 2 times faster.\nSome methods of `BufferUtils` also gained support for critical natives, but I didn't benchmark how much they're faster and as is the case with `Matrix4` only methods that pass primitive arrays gained support.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4097","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4097/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4097/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4097/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4097","id":156171546,"number":4097,"title":"Allow tap count reset on ClickListener","user":{"login":"cypherdare","id":1843131,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1843131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare","html_url":"https://github.com/cypherdare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-05-22T20:40:20Z","updated_at":"2016-08-07T02:56:56Z","closed_at":"2016-08-07T02:56:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/4097","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4097","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4097.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4097.patch"},"body":"I was having a hard time working around this missing method.

Reposted here with permission from @MobiDevelop.\n#### Issue details\n\nUsing the latest `gdx-setup.jar`, creating a new default LibGDX project using gdx-setup.jar, running `./gradlew clean build` causes build failure with all current versions of @MobiDevelop's RoboVM Gradle plugin.\n\nThere is some sort of conflict between the RoboVM Gradle plugin & the Android Gradle plugin. If you remove either one of these two plugins from the buildscript, the build will succeed. Changing dependency and/or plugin versions did not cause any change, as you can see below.\n\nError message:\n\n```\nExecution failed for task ':android:lintVitalRelease'.\n> originalComplianceLevel\n```\n\nRoot cause:\n\n```\nCaused by: java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: originalComplianceLevel\n```\n\nRelated issue: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/adt-dev/2LnnpF-t6XA\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n1.

ensure you have given all the following requested information in your report.\n#### Issue details\n\nOn libgdx 1.9.1 (haven't tested on other versions) it seems that AndroidGraphics.pause() kills the running process because pause doesn't get set to false by onDrawFrame() and it timeouts.\n\nNormally, from what I have seen when running an emulator, clicking the HOME button when in a libgdx application calls AndroidApplication.onPause() and AFTER that it kills the render surface. But on a Nexus 5 with latest updates (android 6.0.1 marshmallow), onPause() is called after onDrawFrame() stops being called, meaning that pause = false never gets called, so after a timeout of 4000 ms the process gets killed.\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nPut a breakpoint in AndroidApplication.onPause() and check if onDrawFrame() still called after the breakpoint hits. On nexus 5 android 6.0.1 you will notice that the rendersurface is destroyed before onPause() gets called, while in the emulator it's the other way around. This bug could happen on other devices as well but I only have a nexus 5 at hand right now.\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\n1.9.1 possibly on other versions\n#### Please select

This would tell the implementer how much the Actor moved by rather than just simply notifying a change in position.\n##### Hypothetical code\n\n```\n@Override\npublic void positionChanged(float deltaX, float deltaY) {\n   if(Math.sqrt(deltaX*deltaX + deltaY*deltaY) > MAX_SPEED) {\n      //insert logic to handle a speedy player\n   }\n}\n```\n##### Reasoning\n\nI find myself implementing this simple feature often so I figured why not add it to libgdx :)?
