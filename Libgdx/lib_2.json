Trying to set Actor.toFront() which is a child of HorizontalGroup, will force the actor to be the last one in the list, the expect behavior that the Actor will be just drawing last and appear on top.  We need the layout help of the HorizontalGroup but to make extra effects that will go outside the actor/group bounds, we thought to use ZIndex / Actor.toFront() as currently anything drawing outside that bound is being hidden by neighbor actors.  The problem that the Group is using children array to manage drawing order, HorizontalGroup and other layout managed groups are using the same children array for the layout order too, I think they should be different arrays. \r\n\r\n![zindex](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8027780/29529499-9d120a60-86a8-11e7-9f1a-f90b5bde43ea.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n```java\r\nHorizontalGroup hg=new HorizontalGroup();\r\nTextButton b1=new TextButton(\"Button 1\", skin);\r\nTextButton b2=new TextButton(\"Button 1\", skin);\r\nhg.addActor(b1);\r\nhg.addActor(b2);\r\n\r\nb1.toFront(); // This will change the order, making b2 as first item in list !\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.6\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4864","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4864/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4864/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4864/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4864","id":251521298,"number":4864,"title":"ScrollPane: Don't render scroll bars if they won't be visible on screen","user":{"login":"WickedShell","id":567688,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/567688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WickedShell","html_url":"https://github.com/WickedShell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WickedShell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WickedShell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WickedShell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WickedShell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WickedShell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WickedShell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WickedShell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WickedShell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WickedShell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-20T23:12:35Z","updated_at":"2017-08-21T19:14:54Z","closed_at":"2017-08-21T19:14:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/4864","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4864","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4864.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4864.patch"},"body":"If the scroll bars won't be visible (either because they aren't needed or the alpha will be 0) then don't bother drawing the bar or the knob.\r\n\r\nThis was prompted by chasing down why I had a 12 vertex draw call happening that resulted in no change to the backbuffer.
