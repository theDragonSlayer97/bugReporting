ensure you have given all the following requested information in your report.\r\n\r\n#### Issue details\r\n[Table](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/db805953849780161df7c1fb96f81248c19cff44/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/ui/Table.java) inherits (indirectly) from [Group](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/Group.java), which means Table has the following three methods for adding a child node:\r\n\r\n* [add(Actor)](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/db805953849780161df7c1fb96f81248c19cff44/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/ui/Table.java#L194)\r\n* [addActorBefore(Actor, Actor)](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/db805953849780161df7c1fb96f81248c19cff44/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/Group.java#L290)\r\n* [addActorAfter(Actor, Actor)](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/db805953849780161df7c1fb96f81248c19cff44/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/Group.java#L304)\r\n\r\nA developer using Scene2d *might* reasonably assume that all of these will work, when in fact, only the first method works -- the other two methods will execute and return normally, but will not layout the newly-added actor correctly (it'll be laid out underneath the last child of the Table).\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n_Even if you think your issue is trivial to reproduce, please supply a [SSCCE](http://sscce.org/) that demonstrates your issue.  This saves time on our end, and makes it much more likely that your issue will be fixed.\r\nYou can find barebones templates [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Getting-help)_\r\n\r\nI'm not sure this requires repro steps or code. Let me know if you want them.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nLibGDX 1.9.5, but current mainline appears affected as well.\r\n\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\nNo stacktrace.\r\n\r\n#### Affected platforms\r\nAll.\r\n\r\n#### What I'm looking for\r\n\r\nI'm looking for anything that would have saved me an hour of fiddling with `pack()` and `invalidateHierarchy()` just to find that these methods just don't work presently. I'd be happy with any of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Override `addActor{Before|After}()` in Table so they work as expected.\r\n2. Override `addActor{Before|After}()` in Table and make them throw an exception.\r\n3. Override `addActor{Before|After}()` in Table and have it call `super`, but *also* annotate the method as `@Deprecated` with a reason why.\r\n\r\nI can see that the [documentation](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Table#inserting-cells) does mention this exact issue, near the very bottom, but I didn't see this and I suspect others might miss it as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4601","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4601/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4601/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4601/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4601","id":207078458,"number":4601,"title":"Can not play 2 Music instances at the same time on Android","user":{"login":"SasLuca","id":15983269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15983269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca","html_url":"https://github.com/SasLuca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-12T21:00:17Z","updated_at":"2017-02-28T22:43:27Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"#### Issue details\r\nI am developing a game in which I need to play 2 Music instances at the same time.

Then apply the same rotation to the camera that you apply to the texture. That way from the camera perspective everything should look like nothing is changing, since you cancle out all moving factors.\r\nThe problem is that you still see pixel-movement inside the texture.\r\n**I attached a Demo-Project that reproduces this exact issue:**\r\n[test.zip](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/files/768326/test.zip)\r\n\r\nHere is the Code from the Game-Class \r\n```\r\n\r\npackage com.mygdx.game;\r\n\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.ApplicationAdapter;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.Gdx;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.GL20;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.OrthographicCamera;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Texture;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.SpriteBatch;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.TextureRegion;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.math.MathUtils;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.math.Vector2;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.utils.viewport.ScreenViewport;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.utils.viewport.Viewport;\r\n\r\npublic class MyGdxGame extends ApplicationAdapter {\r\n    private static final int SIZE = 500;\r\n\r\n    private Viewport viewport = new ScreenViewport();\r\n    private SpriteBatch batch;\r\n    private TextureRegion img;\r\n    private float rotation = 0f;\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void create() {\r\n        batch = new SpriteBatch();\r\n        img = new TextureRegion(new Texture(\"badlogic.jpg\"));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void render() {\r\n        // Creating Viewport\r\n        viewport.update(Gdx.graphics.getWidth(), Gdx.graphics.getHeight(), true);\r\n        OrthographicCamera camera = (OrthographicCamera) viewport.getCamera();\r\n        camera.viewportWidth = 1000;\r\n        camera.viewportHeight = 1000;\r\n        camera.zoom = 0.1F;\r\n\r\n        final float camMod = Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTime() * 300F;\r\n        rotation = translateRotation(rotation + camMod);\r\n\r\n        final Vector2 pos = localToParentCoordinates(new Vector2(SIZE / 2, SIZE / 2));\r\n        camera.position.set(pos, 0);\r\n        camera.rotate(-camMod);\r\n        camera.update();\r\n\r\n        Gdx.gl.glClearColor(1, 0, 0, 1);\r\n        Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\r\n        batch.setProjectionMatrix(camera.combined);\r\n        batch.begin();\r\n        batch.draw(img, -SIZE / 2, -SIZE / 2, SIZE / 2, SIZE / 2, SIZE, SIZE, 1, 1, rotation);\r\n        batch.end();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public Vector2 localToParentCoordinates(Vector2 localCords) {\r\n        final float cos = MathUtils.cosDeg(360F -

Then I tried running the tests in an emulator and everything is working fine, but on my Nexus 5 Marshmallow it crashes with error. If I want to build libgdx, including the native files, how should I proceed? There is also a thread in the forums opened about this: http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=25695&p=101372#p101372\r\n\r\nInitially I thought I did something wrong but investigating further it seems that the automatically downloaded libgdx native libraries are build with an older and probably buggy ndk version. Or the latest version introduces new bugs, I don't know.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.5 master branch latest\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\n01-30 12:56:48.101: E/AndroidRuntime(20651): Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: dlopen failed: cannot locate symbol \"__aeabi_memclr\" referenced by \"/data/app/com.badlogic.gdx.tests.android-1/lib/arm/libgdx.so\"...\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [x ] Android\r\n- [ ] iOS (robovm)\r\n- [ ] iOS (MOE)\r\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\r\n- [ ] Windows\r\n- [ ] Linux\r\n- [ ] MacOS\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4580","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4580/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4580/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4580/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4580","id":203989361,"number":4580,"title":"improve gitignore template fix libgdx/libgdx#4560","user":{"login":"mgsx-dev","id":8074238,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8074238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/mgsx-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-30T11:49:34Z","updated_at":"2017-02-05T13:22:40Z","closed_at":"2017-02-05T13:22:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/4580","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4580","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4580.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4580.patch"},"body":"as discussed in #4560, here is the fix (maybe not the final fix).\r\n\r\nI'm not really confident with these modifications because I'm not using all OS/IDE/Targets. I'm using eclipse on linux and mostly target desktop and android so I think this fix should be validated by more contributors.\r\n\r\nHas you can see, what I've done so far is : \r\n* add leading slashes and full path to avoid unwanted ignore.\r\n* removed some duplicates : for instance html/war/WEB-INF/deploy/ is useless with /html/war\r\n* removed some IMO useless : tmp/\r\n* move local.properties to gradle section\r\n\r\nNote that I could use single wildcard instead of path for every sub project (for instance /*/dist/) but it could conflicts with some project specific folder structure.\r\n\r\n@Tom-Ski : I don't really understand why you want to keep just one big file instead of dispatching some parts in related sub projects. It would be cleaner way for many reasons : \r\n* make gitignore files more readable.\r\n* avoid useless ignore when not targeting all platforms.\r\n* easily manage sub folder renaming / moving.\r\n\r\nThanks to point me in the right direction in order to improve these changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4579","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4579/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4579/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4579/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4579","id":203834024,"number":4579,"title":"[GWT] error in gdx.gwt.xml","user":{"login":"SergeyLabutin","id":16681137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16681137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeyLabutin","html_url":"https://github.com/SergeyLabutin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeyLabutin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeyLabutin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeyLabutin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeyLabutin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeyLabutin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeyLabutin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeyLabutin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeyLabutin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeyLabutin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-01-28T21:54:22Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T21:54:22Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I cat not compile gwt project.
