I had an FPS of 60.\n\nStrangely, when using 200 ParticleEffect's to draw a total of 2000 sprites per frame (additive) with the same particle sprite and particle file (*.p), the framerate drops to ~30. Per frame around 800 glDrawElements calls were made. FPS was 30.\n\nI think this is due to the fact that every time a ParticleEffect is loaded, a new sprites is created, creating a new texture instance. \n\nThis test hack improved my framerate from 30 to 60:\n\n```\npublic void loadEmitterImages (FileHandle imagesDir) {\n    ownsTexture = true;\n    HashMap<String, Sprite> loadedSprites = new HashMap<String, Sprite>(emitters.size);\n    for (int i = 0, n = emitters.size; i < n; i++) {\n        ParticleEmitter emitter = emitters.get(i);\n        String imagePath = emitter.getImagePath();\n        if (imagePath == null) continue;\n        String imageName = new File(imagePath.replace('\\\\', '/')).getName();\n        Sprite sprite = loadedSprites.get(imageName);\n        if (sprite == null) {\n            sprite = new Sprite(loadTexture(imagesDir.child(imageName)));\n            loadedSprites.put(imageName, sprite);\n        }\n\n        emitter.setSprite(sprite);\n\n        // Test, reduces draw calls when using multiple emitters with the same particle sprite\n        emitter.setSprite(Game.img);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhat do you guys think? Should we write a fix for this? I think its just a matter of statically caching any sprite that gets loaded using a particleeffect. Whe we cache this by filename, and reuse instances while loading particleeffects the problem should be gone.\n\nI can upload a demo project that shows the framerate difference if needed.\n\n(Tested using LibGDX 1.7.1 on Android 4.4.4 on Google Nexus 7 2012)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3613","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3613/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3613/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3613/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3613","id":119960264,"number":3613,"title":"Extend reflection support by adding ClassReflection.getInterfaces(Class<?> c)","user":{"login":"danijelz","id":13315108,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13315108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danijelz","html_url":"https://github.com/danijelz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danijelz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danijelz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danijelz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danijelz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danijelz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danijelz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danijelz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danijelz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danijelz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336982,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-12-02T15:01:35Z","updated_at":"2015-12-02T20:58:33Z","closed_at":"2015-12-02T19:54:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"GWT part can be generated in ReflectionCacheSourceCreator since creator is already aware of interfaces (JClassType[] interfaces = c.getImplementedInterfaces(); in line 296). \n\ncom.badlogic.gwtref.client.Type should get another field:\nfinal Set<Class> interfaces;\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3612","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3612/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3612/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3612/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3612","id":119849904,"number":3612,"title":"Minor addition to wiki (re: NBAndroid installation)","user":{"login":"mbaranczak","id":105456,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/105456?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaranczak","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaranczak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaranczak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaranczak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaranczak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaranczak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaranczak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaranczak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaranczak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaranczak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaranczak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-12-02T01:55:45Z","updated_at":"2015-12-02T02:22:06Z","closed_at":"2015-12-02T02:07:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"wiki page: https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Setting-up-your-Development-Environment-%28Eclipse%2C-Intellij-IDEA%2C-NetBeans%29\n\nNetBeans 8.1 broke compatibility with NBAndroid.
