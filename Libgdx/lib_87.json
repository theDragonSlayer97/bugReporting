like dialog is not closing on 1st button touch or draw loop hangs (on 1 core android)...workaround is to overload:\n\n@Override\n            public void hide()\n            {\n                System.err.println(\"Hidding dialog\");\n                hide(sequence(Actions.fadeOut(0.4f, Interpolation.fade)));\n            }\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2316","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2316/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2316/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2316/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2316","id":42334506,"number":2316,"title":"set

serializing a String that contains a numerical value, such as \"123\", with the default OutputType.minimal, the output should contain the value withing quotes otherwise when it gets unserialized it will produce a different String value such as \"123.0\". Example:\n\n``` java\npublic static class X { public String s; public X() {}; }\n\nX x1 = new X();\nx1.s = \"123\";\nString jsonString = new Json().toJson(x1); // {s:123}\nX x2 = new Json().fromJson(X.class, jsonString); // x2.s has value \"123.0\"\n```\n\nThe value of x2.s is now \"123.0\", when it should be \"123\". The same problem happens for very large numbers like \"1234567890123456789012\" which gets converted to \"1.2345678901234568e+21\", which is very problematic as many services use such strings as identifiers.\n\nOne solution is to call setOutputType(JsonWriter.OutputType.javascript), but this is a workaround not a solution, and prevents other optimizations as well.\n\nThe ideal solution would be to change the JsonWriter.OutputType.quoteValue() method to also quote numerical strings. Since JsonWriter.OutputType is an enum not a class, it cannot be extended or customized without changing the LibGDX source code.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2299","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2299/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2299/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2299/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2299","id":41992075,"number":2299,"title":"Cell.minSize(float, float) Cell.maxSize(float, float) bug","user":{"login":"kutoman","id":5825645,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5825645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kutoman","html_url":"https://github.com/kutoman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kutoman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kutoman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kutoman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kutoman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kutoman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kutoman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kutoman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kutoman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kutoman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-09-04T22:13:06Z","updated_at":"2014-09-05T14:14:16Z","closed_at":"2014-09-05T14:14:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Currently:\n\n```\n/** Sets the minWidth and minHeight to the specified values. */\npublic Cell<T> minSize (float width, float height) {\n    minSize(new Fixed(width));\n    return this;\n}\n```\n\nShould be:\n\n```\n/** Sets the minWidth and minHeight to the specified values. */\npublic Cell<T> minSize (float width, float height) {\n            this.minWidth= new Fixed(width);\n            this.minHeight= new Fixed(height);\n    return this;\n}\n```\n\nThe same goes for the maxSize method.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2298","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2298/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2298/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2298/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2298","id":41942675,"number":2298,"title":"Added frame identification support.","user":{"login":"davebaol","id":2366334,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2366334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol","html_url":"https://github.com/davebaol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336982,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-09-04T14:24:03Z","updated_at":"2014-09-07T17:50:34Z","closed_at":"2014-09-07T16:18:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/2298","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2298","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2298.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2298.patch"},"body":"Frame identification is a very cheap and common technique to avoid repeating calculations during the same frame.\nOf course if you're writing an app you can quickly implement this technique inside the render() method of your ApplicationListener.\nHowever, if you're writing a gdx extension or any high abstraction level framework the above solution is not acceptable. In these cases, a cleaner solution is possible only if the gdx core provides frame identification support directly.\n\nIn fact, I've tried to exploit Gdx.graphics.getRawDeltaTime() hoping that it always takes different values for subsequent frames, see https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2202#discussion_r15785050. Unfortunately, it turned out that the delta time has the same value of the previous frame more than once per minute. In short, it's a ugly hack, and performs poorly too.\n\nSo I added the getFrameId method to the Graphics interface and implemented this feature for all the back-ends but the robovm one, because unfortunately I can't compile and test.\n\nFinally I'm sorry for the wall of pink in this PR. I've literally spent countless hours so far trying to get rid of it. Unfortunately it happens too rarely to see if you have found the ultimate solution. I won't give up though :) \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2297","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2297/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2297/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2297/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2297","id":41867487,"number":2297,"title":"getInputStream ()  in NetJavaImpl","user":{"login":"Kjos","id":6412041,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6412041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kjos","html_url":"https://github.com/Kjos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kjos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kjos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kjos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kjos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kjos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kjos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kjos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kjos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kjos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-09-03T21:01:58Z","updated_at":"2014-09-04T12:54:42Z","closed_at":"2014-09-04T12:54:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The returned InputStream seems to cause issues in the LWJGL backend.
