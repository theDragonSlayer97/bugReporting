The first line after the comment is indented properly. the second enter indents to the indent level of the comment, which is usually incorrect.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n```\r\n/*\r\n *\r\n *\r\n */\r\nfirst enter leaves me here\r\n\r\n/*\r\n *\r\n *\r\n */\r\n\r\n hit enter twice, and it indents me here, underneath the asterisk, which is off by a space.\r\n```\r\nIdeally, if I'm not actively typing in a multiline comment, I would want auto-indent to completely ignore comments altogether as if they're not even there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35708","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35708/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35708/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35708/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35708","id":263416543,"number":35708,"title":"[website]
