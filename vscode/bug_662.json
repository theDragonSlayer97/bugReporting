VSCode Version: 1.7.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Do anything that would cause trailing whitespace, such as deleting a newline when the following line contains only whitespace, or typing some characters, then some whitespace in preparation for the next word, but then changing your mind and moving the cursor elsewhere.\r\n2. Go to another line, or press HOME to go back to the start of the current line.\r\n3. With the cursor anywhere before the end of the original line, press END to jump back to the end, and start typing again.\r\n\r\n**The END key jumps to the last non-whitespace character instead of the last character**. This makes sense for the HOME key, because you usually want to go to the start of the current line indentation, but the END key should not have this behaviour because (a) if you typed trailing whitespace deliberately, you probably want to keep it, and (b) if you did not type trailing whitespace deliberately, you probably want to get rid of it, which requires first knowing it's there. Yes, you can turn on hidden whitespace, but this doesn't change things, it just makes this friction more visible while editing.\r\n\r\nBecause the END key tricks you into thinking that the line has no trailing whitespace, you end up with a lot of lines with one, two or three trailing spaces as a result of making small edits to code. You then go to commit code to the repo only to realise there is a bunch of extraneous whitespace you didn't previously notice. This is also an annoyance when jumping around the code in other ways, as the previously-hidden whitespace gets in the way of edits and needs to be corrected.\r\n\r\nI actually made [an extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NathanRidley.autotrim) just to solve this and it currently has over 500 installs despite no promotion on my part, suggesting that others find this annoying too, and looked for an extension to solve the problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15923/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15922","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15922/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15922/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15922/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15922","id":191130772,"number":15922,"title":"Include @types from typings","user":{"login":"sant123","id":7959437,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7959437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sant123","html_url":"https://github.com/sant123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sant123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sant123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sant123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sant123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sant123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sant123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sant123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sant123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sant123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":291055694,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/typescript","name":"typescript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":286886536,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-11-22T21:37:18Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T20:07:54Z","closed_at":"2017-04-04T01:44:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.7.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 8.1\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

The relevant code looks like this:\r\n\r\n\t\tserverOptions = () => new Promise<child_process.ChildProcess>((resolve, reject) => {\r\n\t\t\tfunction spawnServer(...args: string[]): child_process.ChildProcess {\r\n\t\t\t\tlet childProcess = child_process.spawn(\"gcls\");\r\n\t\t\t\tchildProcess.stderr.on('data', data => {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tconsole.log(data.toString());\r\n\t\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t\t\tchildProcess.on('error', err => {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tconsole.warn(err.message);\r\n\t\t\t\t\tconsole.warn('Error running \"gcls\" command.

VSCode Version: 1.7.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. By default assign shortcut for popular emmet actions. For example: I love [emmet actions](http://docs.emmet.io/actions/). So after installing VS Code I had to assign shortkeys for these emmet actions manually\r\ni. editor.emmet.action.wrapWithAbbreviation\r\nii.editor.emmet.action.updateTag\r\niii.editor.emmet.action.removeTag\r\niv.editor.emmet.action.balanceInward\r\nv.editor.emmet.action.balanceOutward\r\n\r\n2.  If all emmet action shortcuts can not be assigned then give us a handy option in menu bar for easy accessing of emmet actions. Previously I used Adobe brackets a lot. In 'Brackets' after installing emmet plugin a menu item called 'emmet' would appear. All emmet actions used to be listed under that menu. \r\n\r\nI hope you awesome guys will consider this issue. :) \r\nThank you guys for this awesome VS Code program. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15903/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4700","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"93E7:366E:769C41:F9F797:59D93F01","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=663>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=661>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"40fd6623cc3e9811812ff690d0f75aea\"","status":"200 OK"}}
