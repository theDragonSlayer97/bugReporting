As an extension developer I would like to use these settings when requesting resources from the internet. My current implementation fails for users using a proxy.\n\nWhat is the recommended way for an extension to use a proxy?\n\nI could not find a `vscode` API that exposes methods to make requests using a proxy other than access to the proxy settings (`workspace.getConfiguration()`) and implementing everything on my own. Looking at the Visual Studio Code code base I identified the code that adds support for proxies, but copy&paste it into my extension would result in duplicated and potentially outdated code, which is something I want to avoid whenever possible. As I am probably not the only extension developer accessing the internet, I would like to hear your opinion on this issue. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12588/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12587","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12587/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12587/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12587/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12587","id":179111224,"number":12587,"title":"OSX:

I get errors on occasion when I am not able to view files.\n\nAs I just open the students files and see that they work and follow the coding requirements can I just use Visual Studio Code instead of having to open Wmware -> Visual Studio?\n\nPerhaps even the students could use Visual Studio Code instead of Visual Studio to accomplish their assignments......?\n\nIt would be great if you could make it clear in your FAQ in regards to this.\n\nI apologize for the issue. I should send feedback instead. But contacting Microsoft has always for me in like walking around in a maze. It takes time and is hard to figure out where to actually send feedback. Having a Facebook page, or a simple way to contact you guys would really help.\n\nThank you!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12581","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12581/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12581/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12581/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12581","id":179101437,"number":12581,"title":"Accessibility : High contrast mode, menu items not visible","user":{"login":"amitse","id":2761516,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2761516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitse","html_url":"https://github.com/amitse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-25T18:44:10Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T15:33:00Z","closed_at":"2016-09-27T15:33:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.5.3 (5be4091987a98e3870d89d630eb87be6d9bafd27, 2016-09-22T08:50:42.185Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1) Set High contrast black theme ( in windows : Setting -> Ease of Access -> High Contrast)\n2) Open Vscode \n\nMenu items are not visible.
