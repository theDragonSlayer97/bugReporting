Everytime I run (not debug!, Ctrl+F5) my application, the application is run but I don't see the debug toolbar. Besides that I also can't use my debug hotkeys to start/stop the application. What's weird about this is that as soon as I type anything into my debug console the debug toolbar gets visible and the debug hotkeys get usable again. \r\nI'm working with Python, therefore I'm using [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python) extension.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Run any Application. Default shortcut: Ctrl + F5\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nI tried to completely reinstall VSCode now, which didn't work unfortunately. I still had that bug.\r\nAfter uninstalling VSCode 1.7.1 and reinstalling VSCode 1.6.1 it works again.
