hilighted\r\n3. now, edit the file (that contains the 2nd search result) so the line in that file no longer matches the search criteria.\r\n - notice how the 2nd search result disappears from the

A runtime error occurs that states Python is not installed as a framework. A solution to this problem is provided [here](http://matplotlib.org/2.0.0b4/faq/osx_framework.html). The solution relies on the `code .` operator loading the environment variables from that virtual env. Up until 1.9.1 this worked just fine. \r\n\r\nI rolled back to 1.8 to make sure I wasn't crazy and indeed it still works. In 1.8 I was able to load my folder into vs code from terminal using `code .` and modify my launch.json to include \r\n```           \r\n \"osx\": {\r\n    \"pythonPath\": \"frameworkpython\"\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith this modification I could easily use  Matplotlib. Immediately after updating to 1.9.1 I have now provide the full path to the `frameworkpython` file which tells me that the environment variables from the Virtual Env that I am using are no longer being honored in VS Code\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20460","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20460/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20460/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20460/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20460","id":206924664,"number":20460,"title":"i have problem with update vs code 1.8 to 1.9 ","user":{"login":"drg-michael","id":25697082,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25697082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drg-michael","html_url":"https://github.com/drg-michael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drg-michael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drg-michael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drg-michael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drg-michael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drg-michael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drg-michael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drg-michael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drg-michael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drg-michael/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-10T22:38:20Z","updated_at":"2017-02-11T05:26:05Z","closed_at":"2017-02-11T05:26:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

though the tree/list has focus (interesting corner cases: rename box in files explorer)\r\n\r\nHere is a list of new commands that will work in every tree and list (unless specifically overridden, for example the files explorer on macOS does not open on <kbd>Enter</kbd>, but rather goes into rename mode. instead, <kbd>Cmd+Enter</kbd> will open from the explorer):\r\n\r\n|Command|Keybinding|\r\n|---|---|\r\n|`list.focusUp`|`kbstyle(Up Arrow)` (additionally on macOS: `kbstyle(Ctrl+P)`)|\r\n|`list.focusDown`|`kbstyle(Down Arrow)` (additionally on
