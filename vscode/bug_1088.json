everyone, \nThanks for the work on this editor and its open nature, it's a really good move from Microsoft, and a promising one.\n\nThe only 2 things missing from my point of view are: \n- a proper settings panel, I understand that it is not trivial, but it's something I guess people could get used to not have, so it's not what this issue is about.\n-  a go-to-function shortcut, I find the ability to jump to a function by pressing Ctrl + R invaluable, and it's supported by Atom too, so it shouldn't be too much of a hassle to find the right package in the atom repo and port some of the code, I think a lot of people will find it useful too.\n\nSo it would be great to get it implemented!\n\nThank you in advance, \nAlvin\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3122","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3122/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3122/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3122/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3122","id":134615238,"number":3122,"title":"Add
