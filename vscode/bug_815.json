would be really helpful if we could provide the language that should be used for code blocks in `Hover`s. Currently we can pass a string of markdown (where code will be uncoloured) or a chunk of text where the _whole thing_ will be considered code in a language.\n\nIn Dart, comments are already markdown, so we have code like this:\n\n```\n/// This is a great method.\n/// \n/// Here is some example code:\n/// \n///     final name = \"Danny\";\n///     print(name);\ndanny() {\n\n}\n```\n\nThe string we get is exactly like that, minus the `///`. In order to get Dart highlighting code the code, we would have to split the document up, detect the code blocks and then created `MarkedString`s with the language set to Dart as each one. This is quite complicated because there are other things that are indented the same way with blank lines before/after (like nested lists). It would be great if we could just set the code language and pass markdown directly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11330","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11330/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11330/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11330/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11330","id":174334435,"number":11330,"title":"Syntax

VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: OS X El Capitan 10.11.5\n\nWhen debugging/launching your code, VSC doesn't use your external terminal preference set in `settings.json`. I think it should be global, or at the very least, another option to be able to change for that specific type of action.\n#### Steps to Reproduce:\n1. In your `settings.json`, set your terminal to a different one. e.g. for OSX, use:\n   \n   ```\n   // Customizes which terminal application to run on OS X.\n   \"terminal.external.osxExec\": \"iTerm.app\"\n   ```\n2. In `launch.json`, set an action with `\"externalConsole\": true`\n3. Start debugging/running your application\n4. Your application will run in the default `Terminal.app` (or your OS equivalent)\n#### Expected behavior:\n\nLast step should respect your
