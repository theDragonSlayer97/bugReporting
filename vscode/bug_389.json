I don't know since when (i.e if it is since 1.11.0 or before that), but it looks that vscode do not warn users about the number of characters in the git commit title when we write over 50 characters. Before, we had a warning telling us that it is recommanded to write a title below 50 characters. But now, there is no warning anymore.  Is it an issue or this feature is no longuer available ?\r\n\r\nThank you for your answer.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24133","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24133/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24133/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24133/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24133","id":220012439,"number":24133,"title":"Crash

Text is layed out in columns which are automatically sized to be as wide as the widest text in that column.**\r\n\r\nMotivation: Like many programmers I have a gigantic screen, but my ability to see a lot of a single source code file is limited by the vertical height of my screen, meaning I often use less than a 3rd of my screen real-estate. The proposed view would allow me to see much more of my file at once. Opening multiple views on the same file are harder to manage.\r\n\r\nThis is a feature request, since it doesn't seem possible to add this functionality as a plugin. Alternatively, consider adding enough functionality to the plugin API to make this feature possible.\r\n\r\nOptionally: intelligent pagination. Inserting new lines would shift all columns, which may be disorienting. Instead, use the natural indentation of most text files to move text to the next column when the \"page break\" would be nested more deeply than a configurable amount of spaces. This would ensure most \"functions\" would be in a single column (not divided), and code would move around between columns much less while editing.\r\n\r\nExample, current view, `*` marks the edge of the editor view:\r\n\r\n    ***************************\r\n    * code                   S*\r\n    *   code                 C*\r\n    * code                   R*\r\n    *                        O*\r\n

Prior to upgrading to 1.11, I had a keybinding:\r\n`{ \"key\": \"cmd+k cmd+n\",       \"command\": \"workbench.action.git.globalOpenChange\"  },`\r\nHowever, in 1.11.1, it seems that this command does not exist (I got an error to that effect when I attempted to use it).  Instead this command is called `git.openChangeFromUri`\r\n2. I updated the keybinding to reflect this:\r\n`{ \"key\": \"cmd+k cmd+n\",       \"command\": \"git.openChangeFromUri\"  },`\r\n\r\nInterestingly, when I type the command in the command pallet, I see my keybinding next to the command:\r\n![screen shot 2017-04-06 at 2 24 38 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20231989/24769525/da0b009c-1ad4-11e7-84ae-c70d077b2ff6.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, when I type the \"cmd+k cmd+n\", it doesn't actually do anything.  I tried giving it a single non-chord key combination (\"alt+n\") and it still didn't work.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n- All of my other key bindings seem to work without issue -- including multi-key chords\r\n- Selecting this command from the command pallet -- ie, as in the screenshot above -- causes the command to work as intended.\r\n- I've experienced no other cases where a command works form the command pallet, but whose key-combination does not work (although I haven't looked for this).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24120/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24119","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24119/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24119/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24119/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24119","id":219988924,"number":24119,"title":"Accessibility:

versions:\r\n\r\nBoth the new SCM and revamped extension viewlits use the new list wg.\r\nIf one is using keyboard navigation each of these require several extra steps and duplicated tab stop\r\nor procedure steps. \r\n\r\nBasic example for extensions:\r\n\r\n- user has copied a marketplace link or entered a search term\r\n- user has to Tab into extension list\r\n- press X number of Down keys\r\n- press Enter - entry gets focus - default entry action opens extension description in editor\r\n- ActionBar actions for the selective list item cannot be accessed unless user Tab stops\r\nall the way from the beginning back to the install button (or gear icon) \r\n- knowing where their current tab stop is can be difficult as it might be out of view\r\nand for current contrast level , color and width of the Tab stop highlight is minimal\r\n\r\nWith new SCM:\r\n- default keyboard action on Enter to select also open file item \r\n- in order to get the per file item actions the user has to go back to the widget a second time\r\nand then use the available Tab stops to get to the actions\r\n\r\nPossible joint solutions:\r\n- Selecting a list item with the keyboard should make the next Tab stop to the action of the item actions\r\n- don't separate focus from selection by keyboard like the old git source widget (actions available on selection)\r\n- use Control Enter to select and activate actions availability or another key\r\n- add user settings item that makes selection and focus overlapped for keyboard only users benefit\r\n\r\nI see accessibility items as main part of April milestones.\r\n\r\nI would do a PR and work on this if accepted...\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24118","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24118/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24118/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24118/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24118","id":219984690,"number":24118,"title":"Keybindings

plan captures the focus of our work during the April iteration. It's a 4 week iteration. We will ship **early May**.\r\n\r\nThe last few iterations were exciting for us. We shipped an abundance of features, and every day we see more new users. With more users comes more activity in our repo:  more PRs, more issues, more discussions. It's a great. Thank you!\r\n\r\nWe have been trying hard to keep up with everything. But, we feel our issue situation is not in the best possible shape. So, for this iteration, we'll slightly shift our focus: We'll focus more on grooming our issues, fixing bugs, and improving engineering than we'll focus on new features. \r\n\r\nWe'll still continue to work on items that have been in flight. For example, last month, we started the exploration to support multi-root workspaces (#396). We'll continue the design and planning work this iteration. BTW, this is a big one and it will take us several iterations to ship it all.\r\n\r\nNo worries, our release notes will still have a few entries :smile:.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Endgame\r\n- *April, 25th*: Code freeze for the endgame (_shifted it by one day since we have less new features to test_)\r\n- *April, 28th*: Endgame done\r\n\r\nThe endgame details for this iteration are tracked in #25250.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Plan Items\r\n\r\nBelow is a summary of the top level plan items.\r\n\r\nLegend for annotations:\r\n\r\n| Mark  | Description |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| :runner: | work in progress  |\r\n| :hand: | blocked task |\r\n| :muscle: | stretch goal for this iteration  |\r\n| :large_blue_circle: | more details required |\r\n| :red_circle: | missing issue reference |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Progress on in-flight items\r\n- [x] :running_man: Investigate into multi-root, multi-folder workspaces #396 @bpasero @tyriar **all**\r\n- [x] :running_man: Additional theming options in the workbench #3112 @aeschli @bpasero **all**\r\n- [x] :running_man: Debug -
