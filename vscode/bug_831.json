interrupting a process.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10834","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10834/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10834/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10834/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10834","id":172679145,"number":10834,"title":"UX
