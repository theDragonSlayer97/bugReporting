VSCode Version: 1.15.0-insiders\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a new file in TypeScript mode. File does not need to be part of a project.\r\n2. Copy the code from this gist: https://gist.github.com/zackschuster/3172f3d85e04ea2619d86129d9b4ec60\r\n3. Expected behavior is in comments\r\n\r\nI left a comment in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25034 with some of this info, then after finding more problems I decided to post a new issue. I bring this up because issues here may indirectly affect that bug.\r\n\r\nBasically, it seems that IntelliSense is given a lot of over-simplified information w/r/t type literals, none of which follows a reliable or even necessarily coherent theory; depending on the context, the same literal may be revealed as its primitive, as its type alias, or as a completely unrelated type alias (!!!) that just happens to share properties.\r\n\r\nWhile none of this appears to have an impact on compile-time correctness, it does make navigating code with IntelliSense more cumbersome than it needs to be while losing an opportunity to use `keyof` and crew with vscode in really powerful ways.\r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions:
