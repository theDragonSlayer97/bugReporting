: string {\n        return '' // TODO\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf I CTRL+hover over `Part` in `renderPart`, what's display isn't information about the imported symbol `Part`, but rather the `import` statement itself, which is rather uninteresting.\n\nThe same is true for \"Go to definition\", which goes to the `import` statement at the top of the file, from where I have to then trace it back to the actual declaration in the file - again, not very useful.\n\nThe same is true for \"Peek definition\", which lets me peek at the `import` statement a few lines above - not helpful.\n\nFinally, \"Find all references\" also doesn't do what you'd hope for - it just gives you a list of references to the local symbol in the current file, rather than references to the imported symbol.\n\nI suspect this boils down to one issue - that imported symbols resolve as just the local symbol, rather than the imported symbol?\n\nI think that there is no real use, for any of the mentioned features, for imported symbols - the local symbols are pretty uninteresting, and it would make a lot more sense to resolve them in advance, so that I don't have to manually drill through them?\n\nI think that they should probably even resolve recursively - because it's quite common to collect a bunch of imports and re-exports for the sole purpose of collecting them; it's a common enough pattern, and in every case, what's interesting is the concrete resolved symbol at the end of that import chain - the local symbols are not very interesting.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8321","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8321/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8321/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8321/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8321","id":162661610,"number":8321,"title":"Standalone
