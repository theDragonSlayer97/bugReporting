Define a class using this syntax\n\n```\nvar MyClass = (function () {\n  function MyClass() {\n      this.id = 0;\n  }\n  return MyClass;\n}());\n```\n1. Trigger IntelliSense for new MyClass(). -- nothing is shown\n2. Remove IIFE and return statement\n\n```\nfunction MyClass() {\n  this.id = 0;\n}\n```\n1. Trigger IntelliSense for new MyClass(). -- IntelliSense is provided again\n\nIn the previous version of VS Code this format was supported and provide auto-complete options for the class as expected. I ended up going with this syntax because that is what I saw TypeScript converting class syntax down to.  However, as of the latest patch I no longer get IntelliSense on any of these classes unless I remove the IIFE and return statement.\nWas this an intentional change?  Is there any official documentation on what types of class syntax VS Code will support for auto-completion?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13520","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13520/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13520/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13520/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13520","id":182310277,"number":13520,"title":"Filter

VSCode Version: 1.6.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nI have the following js snippet:\n\n```\n\"Console.log\": {\n        \"prefix\": \"cl\",\n        \"body\": [\"console.log(${1:obj});$0\"],\n        \"description\": \"Console log\"\n    },\n```\n\nThere is a problem after last update. While the snippet shows on top in autocomplete, the term immediately after it (`class` in this case) is always selected by default. I have to use up arrow to select the snippet. Generally it just selects the most relevant autocomplete term not paying attention to snippets.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13498/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4620","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"8EAE:366E:77175F:FAFEB7:59D9406A","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=743>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=741>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"5c32daabf4386cf1c85dc37a3cecd0df\"","status":"200 OK"}}
