to be our tokenization, rather the css syntax styling selectors for tokens in lists and block quote have higher precedence than the rules for normal inline markdown elements. In the case of a link in a list, we use `.token.markup.list` for all elements inside the list, while the link description in the body is only targeted by `.token.string`.
