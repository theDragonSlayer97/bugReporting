VSCode Version: 1.2.1\n- OS Version: Windows 8.1 x64\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Import a module member using destructuring syntax\n2. F12 / Goto definition on the destructured import symbol\n\nThe first F12 takes you to the destructuring expression. The second F12 then takes you to the actual definition\n\nSee attached gif for an example\n\n![destructured_import](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/563860/16146848/8e0726d2-34c3-11e6-9ea2-c2f5b4c8e9c9.gif)\n\nPossibly also related is that tooltips on destructured import symbols show the import statement instead of its definition\n\n![destructured_import_tip](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/563860/16146886/c002207e-34c3-11e6-88f0-c3c2685cfc30.png)\n\nCompare with non-destructured version\n\n![nondestructured_import_tip](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/563860/16146921/e35c5c6a-34c3-11e6-8fed-ab17b31b3c09.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7805","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7805/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7805/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7805/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7805","id":160845887,"number":7805,"title":"Add shortcut command for show type/signature","user":{"login":"OliverJAsh","id":921609,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/921609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverJAsh","html_url":"https://github.com/OliverJAsh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverJAsh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverJAsh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverJAsh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverJAsh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverJAsh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverJAsh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverJAsh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverJAsh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverJAsh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-06-17T09:18:18Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T07:38:03Z","closed_at":"2016-06-21T07:38:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I want to show the type/signature of an identifier, like when hovering over an identifier, but instead by pressing a keyboard shortcut.

But i have so many problems using VS Code as my IDE. I have installed VSCode 1.2.0 and on 4 occasions using\n\n```\n  i. ionic start MyApp --v2 blank\n ii. ionic start MyApp --v2 tabs\niii. ionic start MyApp --v2 --ts blank\n iv. ionic start MyApp --v2 --ts tabs. \n```\n\nFor all these 4 projects, i have different challenges to the extent that none of the 4 project have succesfully compile or been built without different errors when i do so with VS Code. However all these projects run by firing ionic serve in their respective directories.\n\nIn the cases of i. & ii.\n\nImport statements and @ statements had errors until i added a jsconfig.json file with the following details;\n\n{ \"compilerOptions\": { \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true, \"experimentalDecorators\": true, \"module\": \"amd\", \"target\": \"ES6\" }, \"files\": [ \"app/app.js\" ], \"exclude\": [] }\n\nAfter that, running/debugging the project from VS Code produced the error; (function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) { import {Componen ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word (in app\\app.js:1) until i installed the following\n\n```\nnpm install babel-cli --save\nnpm install babel-preset-es2015 --save\n```\n\nWhen i further ran/debugged, i have been getting the error (function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) { @Componen ^^^^^^ SyntaxError: Unexpected unrecognised token\n\nNow i am stucked.\n\nOn the otherhand, in the cases of iii. & iv.\n\nIn the attempt to run/debug the apps, the following errors kept occuring in the following order even after i made or 2 corresponding changes to the launch.json file\n\na. I had the error \"Attribute 'program' does not exist ('${workspaceRoot}/app/app.js')\". So i changed the \"program\" attribute of the configuration section in the launch.json file to '${workspaceRoot}/app/app.ts'\n\nb. After the above, i had the error \"Cannot launch program '${workspaceRoot}\\app\\app.ts'; configuring source maps might help.\", then i changed sourceMaps atrribute in the configuration section of launch.json to true \"sourceMaps\": true\n\nc. After the above, i had the error \"Cannot launch program '${workspaceRoot}\\app\\app.ts'; setting the 'outDir' attribute might help.\" then i changed the outDir atrribute in the configuration section of launch.json to \"outDir\": \"${workspaceRoot}/bin\" and created the folder \"bin\" in project app root\n\nd. But still, i have been having the same error as above even after all these changes.\n\nPlease can anyone give me better insights to these scenario having googled for the past 6 days.\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7795","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7795/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7795/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7795/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7795","id":160772988,"number":7795,"title":"Add

strategy for allowing users to install markdown-it plugins was discussed in #7656.  This is an attempt to implement the ideas discussed there.  I feel that the README describes the implementation well, so I'll just post it here.  I would like to incorporate a few tests maybe, are there any ideas?  So far, it seems to be working.\n## Using Markdown-it Plugins\n\nTo use a `markdown-it` plugin, goto the directory containing the `markdown-it` extension.  This will be found in the `extensions` folder in your vscode installation.  Install the `markdown-it` plugin as a node module.  For example, to install the `KaTeX` markdown-it extension you would simply type:\n\n``` sh\nnpm install markdown-it-katex\n```\n\nNext, add the plugin into your [settings configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/userandworkspace) under the `\"markdown.plugs\"` namespace.  This setting should contain a list for each `markdown-it` extension you wish to install.  The list should contain an object describing the name of the module, a list of styles that your extension may require, and options that you wish to pass to your extension.  For example, while installing the `markdown-it-katex` extension we would include this in your settings configuration:\n\n``` json\n    \"markdown.plugins\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"markdown-it-katex\",\n            \"styles\": [\n                \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.6.0/katex.min.css\"\n            ],\n            \"options\": { \"throwOnError\": false }\n        }\n    ]\n```\n\nThe `styles` field can contain a filename or a URL.  If the field is a file, file must be placed in the `/media` folder of the vscode markdown extension. And that's all there is to it.
