Windows: `https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=832145`\n\nCurrently the links point to the webpage on the website - but by the time we ship stable we will have the nice PDF versions.\n\nWe should

feedback:\n\nI notice that you have some test methods in here, I typically would rather have a subclass for testing purposes to make it clearer that a method is only used from tests (that is more a personal taste).\n\nYou could use `process.type` to check if you are in the renderer or browser process. Though given my other feedback of splitting services up, I think the renderer should not have a dependency to this backup workspace management service. \n\nYou should not call `fs.existsSync()`, just call `fs.readFile()` and handle the error. That saves you one fs call. \n\nThe `setCurrentWorkspace` is very ugly. Instead I would pass in the `IWorkspaceContextService` as optional dependency and get the workspace from there. Though again, given my feedback on splitting up services, I think this method is a good indication that we need 2 services: one for main side to manager backup workspaces and one for the renderer to backup

notice that many backup related tasks are spread and tightly coupled in many places of untitled world and files world. This is a larger issue where I think the theme should be to LOOSEN the tight coupling of backup to the rest by leveraging more events and services. I am not a big fan of adding all backup matters into the pieces we have today. Instead this should be an optional service that is plugged in from the outside as much as that is possible.\n\nI suggest to introduce a new service for backup handling from the renderer that deals with all these matters. \n\nIt should contain all the methods of `IFileService` for backup related work and just use the IFileService where appropriate. \n\nIt should listen to dirty events from the untitled and text file land and start the business of doing a backup (after a delay - for that take a look into `async.ts/RunOnceScheduler`) as well as cleaning up backups when a file is no longer dirty or the model gets disposed. This also makes it possible to reuse the same code between backing up untitled and text files.\n\nIt should answer to the question if hot exist is enabled or not for the workspace. \n\nIt should participate in the shutdown lifecycle and do the things that `ITextFileServices` today does. I do not expect to see any backup related code in `ITextFileServices`, the only thing it should do is check for the hot exit flag to ask for confirmation or not.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14064","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14064/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14064/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14064/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14064","id":184179046,"number":14064,"title":"Hot Exit: backupService saves and loads a LOT","user":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":296418715,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debt","name":"debt","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":461390715,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/hot-exit","name":"hot-exit","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":287991608,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/important","name":"important","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":291057332,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/verified","name":"verified","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-10-20T09:30:08Z","updated_at":"2016-12-08T10:23:19Z","closed_at":"2016-10-29T21:12:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I do not understand why the `backupService.ts`needs to sync save and load on basically every method invocation.

find it weird that the main side adds a workspace to the backup service but the renderer removes it again on close.

Each window object has an associated workspace path so you can use that. It:\n- adds a workspace to the backup on open\n- removes a workspace from backup on close if there are no backups anymore\n- same for

`registerTreeExplorerNodeProvider(providerId: string, provider: TreeExplorerNodeProvider<any>): Disposable` in vscode namespace\n- `vs/workbench/parts/explorers/*`\n  - The viewlet for tree explorers\n  - Command to toggle each tree explorer\n### Not yet implemented:\n- [x] Handle long running `TreeExplorerNodeProvider.provideRootNode` and `TreeExplorerNodeProvider.resolveChildren` by adding a progress bar.\n- [x] Handle restoring external viewlet if last active viewlet is external.\n  - Construct blank sidebar and restore external viewlet after it gets registered\n  - Show progress bar at top of the blank sidebar while waiting for external viewlet getting registered\n- [x] Refresh button at top of external viewlet\n- [x] Show error popup for handling errors in `TreeExplorerNodeProvider`'s methods.\n- [x] Show error popup for no matching `TreeExplorerNodeProvider` found\n- [x] Use `-webkit-filter` and opacity to style user defined activity bar icons to indicate activation.\n- [ ] Add extension that test against the API\n### High level flow\n- Workbench get constructed\n- Stock Viewlets get registered\n- Extensions' `package.json` get read.\n- `ViewletDescriptor` for external viewlets get registered at `ViewletRegistry`\n- `ActivitybarPart` adds icons for external viewlets when external viewlets finish registration \n- When icon for

that link to symlink of `bin/code`, then this script will fail to launch vscode, because it only follows one layer of symlinks.
