VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: Windows 7/10\n\nSince I upgraded my Node version to 6, I have a strange bug with my Node/Webpack/VSCode combo that I can reproduce on both my home and work PCs, but not on my colleagues' that are still on Node 5.\n\nBasically, if I open VSCode first, I cannot start any webpack build from either the built-in console, the built-in tasks or even an external console (that had been opened after) without having it fail right away because it cannot use any loader. I use Typescript and I get an error at the first 'non-standard' feature webpack encounters saying it needs a loader to handle that file. I get the error with both `awesome-typescript-loader` and `ts-loader`.\n\nBut if I open an external console first and then VSCode, then, in that console, I can launch all my builds without issues, even if VSCode is opened.\n\nThis isn't blocking in any way, that it's pretty restrictive (and weird).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11165","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11165/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11165/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11165/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11165","id":173954301,"number":11165,"title":"Clear
