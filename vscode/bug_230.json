It's a request to implement what the Chrome developer tools has. Currently, if you are debugged at a point in the JS code, you can highlight some code and when you mouse-over the code, it will execute it and show you the results.

to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Very hard to reporoduce. I'm using a repository interface and one of the methods was telling me it wasn't found nor would intellisense find it even though it debugs without issue. In VS2017 I see no error at all and it does find the method with intellisense as well. I took screenshots to show... First shows the error method in question. Second shows when I selected the error and typed 'CTRL+.' the VSCode suggestion was to generate the method in the interface so I clicked it and the error then changed to 'You already have a method with the exact same name and parameters' and the screenshot shows the method I had declared and the new one VSCode declared which are the exact same things...\r\n\r\nSo after that, deleting one of them took the error away in the original file but I still feel like you guys/girls should know about this. Hope it helps.\r\n![vscode_error1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16159685/27232897-accd51f0-5285-11e7-80ac-f68e77c31a6c.PNG)\r\n![vscode_error2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16159685/27232902-af7fcb08-5285-11e7-97c7-1266b9a9419d.PNG)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28897","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28897/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28897/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28897/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28897","id":236512341,"number":28897,"title":"Cannot

the Mac, in most apps made by Apple and others, users can select some text and then press command-E to make it the \"Find\" term.
