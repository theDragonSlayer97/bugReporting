of the many hundreds of awesome features of `vi(m)` is the ability to jump between several lines and do all sorts of things very quickly. However, that's very difficult to accomplish with the traditional editors.  \nAnd this is something I constantly end up missing in VSCode. While there exists a vim emulation, its far from properly usable - At this moment, the idiomatic VSCode way seems a lot more productive. \n\nMeanwhile, the `Goto` feature is often underlooked. Currently the `Goto` command pops up the command manager prompting for the line number/col number. \n\nHowever, it'd be a relatively easy tweak to this to allow jumping between lines in a relative way. So, the proposal is: \n1. For the most part the `Goto` behavior is unchanged.\n2. Prefix a number with `+`, say `+20` - now Goto uses the relative information instead of directly going to line 20. So, if the cursor was already at line 20, this ends ups moving to line 40. \n3. Prefix with `-`, and do just the opposite. Move backward. \n4. Column interactions should remain the same. \n5. Press and Hold \"Shift\" while hitting \"Enter\" to finalize the \"Goto\" command (Shift+Enter, instead of just typing the number and pressing Enter): This ends up selecting the entire block of text inbetween. \n\nAll the above should be relatively simple implementation. However, the next one is quite different, but will be extremely productive. When the Goto command is open - `Start highlighting brackets, parenthesis, and significant codepoint like class names. And the highlight should be accompanied by quick text hints to jump to them straight away`. Somewhat like how \"Vimium\" (https://vimium.github.io/) does it on Chrome for links. \n\nI was looking for a starting point for an extension for the last feature. However, since VSCode provides no way for custom UI interfaces, of overlay, it seems impossible to do it using the currently exposed extensions points. So, I guess its completely upto the team to implement something like these, or if someone can provide suggestions on how to proceed with the hightlights like Vimium does, I'd be happy to prototype an extension. :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3644/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3643","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3643/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3643/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3643/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3643","id":137931180,"number":3643,"title":"Show commands in `Command Palette` based on context (like `when` in KeyBindings)","user":{"login":"alefragnani","id":3781424,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3781424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani","html_url":"https://github.com/alefragnani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-02T16:58:59Z","updated_at":"2017-06-01T06:12:19Z","closed_at":"2017-06-01T06:12:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When you define a `keybinding` in `package.json`, you are able to define `when` the keybinging works.

The Problem\n\nVSCode can nicely handle comments in JSON files. However, the [JSON](http://www.json.org) specification [does **not** allow comments in JSON files](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/244777/can-i-use-comments-inside-a-json-file). Therefore most JSON parsers fail when JSON files contain comments. E.g. [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) fails, and even the typescript compiler fails on [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/tsconfig.json) files that include comments.\n\nAnother problem is that syntax highlighting does not work on github. For example, the file [`extensions/xml/xml.configuration.json`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/54609ce3f6c701a851157b5a936818b724694a53/extensions/xml/xml.configuration.json) ist not legal JSON. This is symptomatic for repositories that are managed with VSCode:\n- @dbaeumer in [`eslint/.vscode/tasks.json`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint/blob/1629dbe09d4e252f4fd49fb3786079425ab9e253/eslint/.vscode/tasks.json)\n- @weinand in [`vscode-node-debug/.vscode/launch.json`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-node-debug/blob/20fe4f767477b0ad8fe0ee6e60b3b265ad087321/.vscode/launch.json#L33)\n- @egamma in [`vscode-go/blame/master/.vscode/launch.json`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/blob/d3a1502c4766f4fe5a6d471a7d0b95e1f46b7cae/.vscode/launch.json)\n## Proposal: create a new file type, e.g. `.tson`\n\nInstead of misleading people about the syntax of JSON by providing support for comments in JSON files, VSCode should rather use a new format like `TSON`, that would be an extension of JSON that allows for comments. There could be a simpler pre-processor for TSON (like [JSON.minify](http://blog.getify.com/json-comments/)) that converts TSON into JSON by stripping away the comments.\n\nWith such a new file type, VSCode could happily use them without compromising the integrity of existing `.json` files. \n\nIn addition, it would be cool to use typescript ambient definitions for `.tson` files. I really like the typescript  [schema for `tasks.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks_appendix).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3641/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3640","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3640/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3640/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3640/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3640","id":137914878,"number":3640,"title":"Accessibility:

I use this feature extensively in other editors and it allows all devs to keep code inline regardless of who or when the file was last revised.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3630","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3630/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3630/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3630/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3630","id":137860403,"number":3630,"title":"Strange highlighting of brackets in insiders build","user":{"login":"Wosi","id":3448684,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3448684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi","html_url":"https://github.com/Wosi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-03-02T12:21:54Z","updated_at":"2016-03-03T16:21:34Z","closed_at":"2016-03-03T16:21:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I face these strange highlightings for brackets in the latest insiders build:\n![vscode_insiders_feb_brackets](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3448684/13460152/03e6732a-e079-11e5-91b1-1967371b1fec.png)\n\nI can't figure out whether the highlighter API has changed so that I need to adjust my OmniPascal plugin or if this is a bug in the latest build.
