I found out it's under a kind of a *denial of service* attack coming from the latest version of VSCode. It's asking for code actions every time the cursor is placed inside a word. When I scroll through a file using the arrow keys the lanuguage server is being asked many times to provide code actions. \r\n\r\nThe following GIF shows the requests sent by VSCode while moving the cursor:\r\n\r\n![codeactionfoo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3448684/22832517/9dcd266a-efae-11e6-9ce0-8c4f8eb4d46e.gif)\r\n\r\nI was wondering if this behaviour is intended. So I looked up the [language server protocol documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/protocol.md). It says:\r\n\r\n> The code action request is sent from the client to the server to compute commands for a given text document and range. The request is triggered when the user moves the cursor into **a problem marker** in the editor or presses the lightbulb associated with a marker.\r\n\r\nAs you can see the requests are sent without moving the cursor into a problem marker.\r\nIs the documentation outdated? If yes is there a way to get the currently documented behaviour back? \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20430","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20430/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20430/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20430/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20430","id":206822022,"number":20430,"title":"Alt+O doesn't honor files.exclude","user":{"login":"csholmq","id":1297882,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1297882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csholmq","html_url":"https://github.com/csholmq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csholmq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csholmq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csholmq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csholmq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csholmq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csholmq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csholmq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csholmq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csholmq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-10T15:16:35Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T15:18:51Z","closed_at":"2017-02-10T15:18:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When swithching to matching header file, which is in another folder, all goes well.

you take a look at the controller in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/markers/browser/markersTreeController.ts#L27 there are a bunch of hardcoded keybindings associated for certain actions. We should avoid this and rather introduce commands that the user can associate keybindings with.\r\n\r\nAs part of https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11517 I introduced a new service `IListService` that every tree is registering to. This service tracks focus of the tree and enables a `listFocus` context key whenever the tree has focus. As part of the `register` method you can pass over additional context keys that you want to have set for your domain (e.g. `problemsFocus`). E.g. the \"Open Editors View\" is doing that [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/files/browser/views/openEditorsView.ts#L125). \r\n\r\nI suggest to write new commands that are enabled in the context for the domain (e.g. `problemsFocus`) and remove the hardcoded keybinding handling in the tree controller. When doing so I would pick short and descriptive command Ids (e.g. `problems.something` over `workbench.action.problems.something`).\r\n\r\nIf you need to overwrite a certain keybinding that already exists from the list service (e.g. <kbd>Space</kbd> should do something else than toggling), you can give your command a higher weight (see for example how the explorer is [overriding](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/files/browser/fileActions.contribution.ts#L242) <kbd>Enter</kbd> to do something else on macOS).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20419","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20419/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20419/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20419/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20419","id":206788851,"number":20419,"title":"Debug:

rendering on Windows in VSCode uses subpixel antialiasing, where the display is assumed to be a TN LCD panel with a horizontal R-G-B subpixel arrangement.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, on an IPS or VA panel, this appears to produce chroma bleed and does not give the same benefit as with a TN panel (eg, the text does not appear sharper), as the subpixel structure is fundamentally different.  In my experience, for IPS and VA panels, grayscale antialiasing produces better results when rendering text.\r\n\r\nI don't see a setting in VSCode to configure this, and while the Windows 10 Control Panel -> Display -> Cleartype setting can be changed to grayscale antialiasing, this was ignored for me in VSCode.  (Cleartype setting is GDI only?)\r\n  \r\n* In Sublime Text (Win10), the setting `font_options` can be set to `no_antialias`, `gray_antialias`, and `subpixel_antialias`.  \r\n* In Chrome (Win10), the flag `chrome://flags/#lcd-text-aa` can be set to `disabled` to enable grayscale font antialiasing.  \r\n* [This page](http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/) suggests `--disable-lcd-text` as a command-line argument in Chromium, perhaps similar to the Chrome flag.  Unfortunately, it had no effect with VSCode.  \r\n\r\nPlease consider adding a similar preference to VSCode if possible.
