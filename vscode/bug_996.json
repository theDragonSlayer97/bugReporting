See below for steps to reproduce.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a new empty HTML document on local file system with the following contents:\n\n`<!DOCTYPE HTML>`\n`<html>`\n`<head>`\n`<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\">`\n`<title>Untitled Document</title>`\n`</head>`\n`<body>`\n`<iframe id=\"iframe\" src=\"iframe/2044v01.html?skin=1242&pcl=true\" style=\"width:100%;\" frameborder=\"0\">`\n`Your browser does not support iFrames, please instead <a href=\"iframe/2044v01.html?skin=1242&pcl=false\">continue to card entry</a> in full screen mode`\n`</iframe>`\n`</body>`\n`</html>`\n1. Create a new empty HTML document on local file system inside relative 'iframe' sub directory with '2044v01.html' filename to match above example code. Contents of this 2nd HTML file doesn't matter.\n2. Open Step 1 HTML file in VSCode editor and try to Ctrl+Click on either IFRAME src= or A href= URLs and VSCode will report a \"Unable to open '2044v01.html?skin=1242&pcl=false': File not found (c:\\Users\\700952470\\Documents_Projects\\BT MyDonate Appeals__SVN Repository\\mdft-html-templates\\donate\\sa2016\\iframe\\2044v01.html?skin=1242&pcl=fal..\" error message\n3. If you however edit the URLs in Step 1 HTML from with Query string 'iframe/2044v01.html?skin=1242&pcl=true' to just 'iframe/2044v01.html' then VSCode will open linked page fine on Ctrl+Click\n\nSo it appears that current v1.0.0 of VSCode gets confused if there is a query string on filenames and incorrectly says that file can't be opened, even though shown local path is correct and intended file is present in that location.\n\n![error unable to open screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13105488/14857723/3a363e9a-0c95-11e6-994e-184333f86a58.JPG)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5897","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5897/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5897/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5897/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5897","id":151411767,"number":5897,"title":"Windows Environment Variables","user":{"login":"jsloyer","id":154126,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/154126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer","html_url":"https://github.com/jsloyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-27T15:14:17Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T17:10:29Z","closed_at":"2016-04-27T16:36:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: latest\n- OS Version: Windows\n\nI was looking into how to get user environment variables on Windows and it looks like vscode currently doesnt support that, https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/5b9ec15ce526decc5dd0488339e798f6bcb4ec46/src/vs/base/node/env.ts#L17.

So the replace api will only work with the  primary selection? Then how to make a selection a primary one?\nOr this is a bug of vscode extension module?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5885","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5885/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5885/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5885/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5885","id":151345939,"number":5885,"title":"Javascript: Open symbol (Ctrl+T) and files.exclude settings","user":{"login":"markus-brt","id":18584269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18584269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markus-brt","html_url":"https://github.com/markus-brt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markus-brt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markus-brt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markus-brt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markus-brt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markus-brt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markus-brt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markus-brt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markus-brt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markus-brt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-27T09:55:21Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T13:29:28Z","closed_at":"2016-04-27T13:29:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.0.0\n- OS Version: Windows 8\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
