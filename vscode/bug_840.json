VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nAutocomplete is just out of control.  It tries to complete statements for me when I'm typing a comment, like if I'm adding a comment to a typescript file and I'm writing a sentence like \"this service is for\" and hit enter to go to a new line, it expands into a whole for statement block.  This is only one example, it seems to happen a lot and is very disruptive.\n\nIt also likes to autocomplete while I'm editing markdown files for some reason, I think it might just go off of words in the file?  This is very disruptive because the 'enter' key which I use in normal typing performs the completion, I'll often have errors in my file if I don't watch while I'm typing.  Like I might use the word 'completed' earlier in the file, but if I want to end a line with the word 'complete', it changes to 'completed'\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Start typing in a markdown file or in comments in typescript/javascript/html files, hit 'enter' after typing 'for' in a comment in a typescript file, or type a sentence with the word 'created' in a markdown file, and later type 'create' and hit 'enter'.  I think I've noticed something in html comments as well, but I don't have a handy example.\n\nThis is in addition to the aggressive completion of all quotes and parenthesis.  First, I don't understand why this is even helpful to anyone.  What are you supposed to do when you're done with the parenthesis?  I always have to type them anyway to move on, like if I'm saying \"console.log('\", I end up between the single parens in \"console.log('')\", but when I'm done typing I still need to type \"');\" to put a semicolon at the end of the line.  I don't think they serve a useful purpose, and they cause errors or extra keystrokes when I want to replace things sometimes, like if I want to change quotes to a backtick for a typescript template string, or I'm using a combination of quotes in an attribute in an angular template.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10570/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10569","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10569/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10569/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10569/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10569","id":171316810,"number":10569,"title":"empty
