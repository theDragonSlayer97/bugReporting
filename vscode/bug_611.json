Install [Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag)\r\n2. Open a html file, and type a open tag, e.g. `<div>`\r\n\r\nExpected: A close tag `</div>` is appended\r\nActual: Nothing happens\r\n\r\nAfter investigation, this issue only happens in a html file and the contentChanges of TextDocumentChangeEvent returns wrong text in https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-auto-close-tag/blob/master/src/extension.ts#L21\r\nWhen you type `>` after `<div`, it should return `>`, while it return the text of whole line: `<div>`\r\n\r\nSince a lot of users are using this function and the impact for user is big, I am wondering if we have any other workaround to use this API, or could we fix this in 1.8.1?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17443","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17443/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17443/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17443/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17443","id":196191750,"number":17443,"title":"Sort

No linting or hinting appears for syntax errors or formatting issues\r\n\r\nFull request details:\r\n\r\nI'd like to have a custom linter and formatter for the SQL language - similar to what is available for the python language via plugin support. I found sample code for a simple formatter [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/11/15/formatters-best-practices), but the approach has two limitations: (1) the editing is somewhat \"brute force\" and does not use any standard grammar, and (2) there is no way in that approach to surface linting tips or syntax issues via underlining (\"squigglies\").\r\n\r\nIs support for SQL coming in the near future, and/or are there any frameworks that could be used to apply grammars/rules without rewriting the core parsing/linting engine from scratch? I'm willing and able to contribute code, but I couldn't find any sample linting projects in the docs and it seems prohibitively error prone and time consuming to completely build this functionality from scratch.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17440","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17440/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17440/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17440/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17440","id":196184105,"number":17440,"title":"Open Recent yields Save prompt with Hot Exit enabled","user":{"login":"tedhudek","id":14337110,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14337110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedhudek","html_url":"https://github.com/tedhudek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedhudek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedhudek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedhudek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedhudek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedhudek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedhudek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedhudek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedhudek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedhudek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":421131022,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/as-designed","name":"as-designed","color":"E2A1C2","default":false},{"id":461390715,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/hot-exit","name":"hot-exit","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-12-17T00:41:55Z","updated_at":"2016-12-17T08:29:11Z","closed_at":"2016-12-17T08:29:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.8.0\r\n- OS Version: Win10 version 1611\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
