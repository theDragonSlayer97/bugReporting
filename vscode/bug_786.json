To sum up, the terminal is slow only in VSCode for a reason I don't understand.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12198","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12198/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12198/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12198/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12198","id":177609643,"number":12198,"title":"Quotes and html?","user":{"login":"alsong","id":19310511,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19310511?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alsong","html_url":"https://github.com/alsong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alsong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alsong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alsong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alsong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alsong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alsong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alsong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alsong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alsong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-09-17T21:16:58Z","updated_at":"2016-10-22T15:16:45Z","closed_at":"2016-10-22T15:16:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.5.1 (07d663dc1bd848161edf4cd4ce30cce410d3d877, 2016-09-08T21:33:49.307Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.10240\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1.\n2.\n## Original Title\n\nwhile typing scripts on the lastest vs code. there is a difficulty i face when i press eneter on an attribute that requires me to input text in between quotes and the cursor appears outside the quotes.
