'Uninteresting code' is code that is generated by a transpiling process but is not covered by a source map so it does not map back to the original source. Typically this code gets into your way when stepping through code in the debugger because it makes the debugger switch between the original source code and generated code that you are not really interested in.\n\nThis experimental feature automatically steps through code not covered by a source map until it has reached a location that is covered by a source map again. To enable the feature just add the attribute `smartStep` with a value of `true` to your launch configuration.\n\nHere is a sample project: [async-sample.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/206813/async-sample.zip)\n- unzip and open in VS Code\n- npm install\n- npm run-script compile\n\nVerify that:\n- stepping through code stays in the source and does not jump into the generated code (you can see the skipped steps in the debug console).\n- stepping still makes sense and you can follow what's going on\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4953","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4953/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4953/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4953/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4953","id":145946691,"number":4953,"title":"Support for dynamically generated JavaScript and source maps","user":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/17","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/17","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/17/labels","id":1716950,"number":17,"title":"May 2016","description":"","creator":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":302,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-04-19T13:15:12Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T08:29:02Z","due_on":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-05-31T08:25:06Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-04-05T10:20:22Z","updated_at":"2016-04-23T16:17:23Z","closed_at":"2016-04-23T16:17:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"A recent update to SystemJS has broken this feature.

Always the full thing travels over the wire. A particular nasty issue is that local variables are included in the stack frame object \"for free\" even if nobody requested them. A consequence is that stepping through code with large arrays or buffers in local variables or parameters results in slowness and timeouts.\n\nIn node 0.12.x VS Code started to dynamically inject code into the node runtime to improve the v8 debugging protocol but this stopped working after the io.js/node.js reunion for 2.x and 3.x versions. After fix https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4328 code injection started to work again in node.js 4.3.1 in the LTS stream. For the 5.x stable stream the code injection has to use a slightly different approach that started to work in node 5.6.\n\nVerify for node.js >= 4.3.1 and node.js >= 5.6 that:\n- you can inspect large (~ 100000) arrays and buffers without node.js becoming unresponsive\n\nPlease note: this feature is not about objects with many properties. Objects with many properties will be addressed in Microsoft/vscode-node-debug#18.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4950","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4950/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4950/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4950/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4950","id":145937657,"number":4950,"title":"why
