VSCode Version: 1.16.1\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Set Italian language, or start from command line (`code --locale it`)\r\n2. Open the Find dialog (cmd+F) \r\n3. See the input field of the Find dialog collapsed, probably to allow the \"Nessuna impostazione corrispondente\" (\"No results\" in English) to be shown correctly. \r\n\r\nAdditional comments:\r\n\r\nApart from the too narrow input field, that prevents the user to check what he's writing in the field (see attached screenshots), \"Nessuna impostazione corrente\" is not a correct translation for \"No results\"; it should be \"Nessun risultato\" or \"Nessuna corrispondenza\".\r\n\r\n<img width=\"960\" alt=\"schermata 2017-09-22 alle 17 23 20\"
