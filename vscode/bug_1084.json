http://www.nvaccess.org/\n- If you want to avoid hearing it: right click on the tray icon and choose Tools > Speech Viewer.

Try to move the cursor around and see if the screen reader reads lines or letters. Also do this around 10 lines multiples to find out how NVDA handles the \"page\" switching.\n  - errors should be announced when using `F8` and `Shift-F8`\n  - the hover should be announced when using

Due to this, user hovering over a function call can potentially **mutate** the program state and might be dangerous. We have not yet decided if we will ship this and are looking for feedback. Verify:\n- hovering **works as before** and you can inspect both complex and primitive values\n- be **creative** and by hovering try to trigger a function call which could mutate the program state\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3244","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3244/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3244/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3244/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3244","id":135374824,"number":3244,"title":"Install update - Always install a compatible version of the extension if possible","user":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/12","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/12","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/12/labels","id":1512192,"number":12,"title":"Feb 2016","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":337,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-01-18T10:26:06Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T09:03:53Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2016-03-09T15:09:51Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-02-22T10:18:32Z","updated_at":"2016-02-24T23:40:39Z","closed_at":"2016-02-24T23:40:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"**Issue:** #2894\n**Assignees:**\n- [x] Windows @aeschli\n- [x] OS X @seanmcbreen  \n- [x] Linux @isidorn \n\n**Details:**\n\nCode will now only install extensions that are compatible with the current version of itself.\n- Publish several version of the same extension with a variety of compatibility ranges in the `engines.vscode` field.

This cache helps us in being faster in displaying the extension list but introduces another level of complications.\n\nThe cache itself lives at `http://vscode.blob.core.windows.net/gallery/index`. It is updated every minute due to a Scheduler service in Azure.\n- Make sure searching for extensions inside Code works as before, but is faster.\n- Using a firewall, try blocking the cache's requests. Make sure Code falls back to the original Gallery API.\n- You can (and should) also go into our Azure subscription, stop the scheduler that updates the cache every minute and test the query once 5 minutes have passed. The rule is: if the gallery index is stale for more than 5 minutes, Code should fall back to the original service call. Ultimately, you should always see extensions.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22350/13230063/3adcd882-d9a4-11e5-9e33-ae5c79bbe55c.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3241","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3241/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3241/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3241/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3241","id":135374354,"number":3241,"title":"Launch - Improving launching of OS X remove need to edit the .bashrc files","user":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/12","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/12","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/12/labels","id":1512192,"number":12,"title":"Feb 2016","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":337,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-01-18T10:26:06Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T09:03:53Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2016-03-09T15:09:51Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-02-22T10:16:18Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T14:07:39Z","closed_at":"2016-02-23T15:17:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"**Assignees:**\n- [x] OS X @weinand  \n- [x] OS X @isidorn \n\n**Details:**\n\nOS X users don't need to edit the `.bash_profile` file themselves anymore.
