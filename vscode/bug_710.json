(The preview is derived from the current state of processing the document; not its contents.) Typically, the documents are all on the left column and their previews are on the right. When interacting with the document, its associated preview should become visible (without receiving focus); moving to a different column than the document itself if necessary.

Open users settings\n2. Press `Command +` to increase the zoom\n3. The window zooms out every time you press `command +`. Let's say we press `cmd +` five times, the window zooms out correctly five times but take a look at the value in `settings.json`, the `window.zoom` value each time is likely `1 2 2 4 5`.\n4. However, whether the value you see in the editor is correct or not, when you reload the window, Code remembers the zoom level correctly and the value in `settings.json` is correct as well. For example, after you run `cmd +` three times, the value you see in editor changes from `1` to `2` and then to `2` again, reload the window, `window.zoomLevel` is now `3`, which is correct.\n\nIt

Turn on horizontal editor group layout\n2. Open files `a`, `b` in editor group 1\n3. Open files `c`, `d` in editor group 2\n4. Minimize the non-active editor group so that snapping is enabled\n5. Click on the inactive tab in the other editor group, if snapping works as expected then try a few more times (it felt > 50% repro rate for me)\n\nHere's what the bugged state looks like:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2193314/19696936/2e0e0962-9a9e-11e6-807a-b15c97af14a2.png)\n\nNote that snapping is still enabled and will snap correctly if you switch the editor groups back by click on the active tab in the inactive editor group twice.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14462","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14462/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14462/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14462/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14462","id":185182552,"number":14462,"title":"consider
