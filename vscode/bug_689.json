VSCode Version: 1.7.1\r\n- OS Version: Mac OSX 10.12\r\n\r\nI have a Typescript/React/TSX project. Since my team changed from grunt to webpack and  I updated VSCode, I can't get my global imports work as before, as well as the JSX recognition:\r\n\r\n> [ts] Cannot find module 'react'.\r\n> [ts] Cannot find module 'd3-scale'.\r\n> [ts] Cannot use JSX unless the '--jsx' flag is provided.\r\n\r\nWe have a typings file, so I tried to fix this by making a include rule inside the tsconfig file:\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n        \"target\": \"es6\",\r\n        \"jsx\": \"react\",\r\n        \"sourceMap\": true\r\n    },\r\n    \"include\": [\r\n

just ignored by VSCode, as doing a manual include does the job, nor the tsconfig.json file:\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\n/// <reference path=\"../typings/index.d.ts\" />\r\n\r\n// Global imports\r\nimport * as React from 'react';\r\nimport * as d3Scale from 'd3-scale';\r\n// Ok!\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't feel like I'm doing something wrong, but à tout hasard, this are my workspace settings:\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n    \"typescript.tsdk\": \"./node_modules/typescript/lib\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBest
