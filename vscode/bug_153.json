Ensure this is picked up and that all previous configs are still shown too. The tsc tasks should now be labeled with the folder name at the start.\r\n1. Remove the added folder. Tsconfigs from this folder should be removed as well.\r\n1. Add the folder back. Ensure the tsconfigs from this folder are picked up again\r\n\r\n# Other things to try\r\n- We should support any `tsconfig.*.json` file names anywhere in a folder\r\n- `file.exclude` should prevent a `tsconfig` from being picked up\r\n- Try adding folders with the same name.\r\n- Try adding folders that are subfolders of each other.

Normally text coloring is quite sufficient, but I have come across situations, namely Python, where the ability to color the current code block/context that my active cursor is in, would be **_extremely_** useful. The styling would be much like the current line highlighting (changing as the cursor moves) but for context. The `contextHighlight` would be inclusive of the start of context and end of context. Certainly language support would have to be there, but currently I don't even see a mechanism to change specific lines' backgrounds. Functionality example below...\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# start of file, start context a\r\n# here my context would be of the file, say context a\r\n# and the entire file would have contextHighlight of a\r\nfor i in range(10): # start context b\r\n    # here my context would be context b\r\n    # and have the matching contextHighlight b\r\n    print(i)\r\n    for j in range(5): # start context c\r\n        # here my context would be context c\r\n        # and have the matching contextHighlight c\r\n        print(j) # end context b, end context c\r\n# end context a\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31219","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31219/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31219/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31219/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31219","id":244726690,"number":31219,"title":"The cog hides new visual studio code updates too well","user":{"login":"Jarrio","id":748557,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/748557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarrio","html_url":"https://github.com/Jarrio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarrio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarrio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarrio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarrio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarrio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarrio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarrio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarrio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarrio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":421131022,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/as-designed","name":"as-designed","color":"E2A1C2","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-21T16:55:25Z","updated_at":"2017-07-24T07:45:11Z","closed_at":"2017-07-24T07:45:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Use Help > Report Issues to prefill these. -->\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.14.*\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSince the update which added the cog I've already missed 2 versions as I just don't look at that region of the screen very much - It is *too* hidden and out of the way. I'm not sure what other people's experience is with this but I thought I would put it out there just in case people agree with me.\r\n\r\n1) There's no real reason look in that region of the screen. Apart from updates, but it seems a bit odd to have people learn to consciously check just for updates as that can lead to distracting behaviour. \r\n2) I have a bigger than average monitor 1440p @ 27\" which just hides the cog in so much more space. It is slightly easier to accidentally come across on a 1080p 15.4\" laptop monitor but again it's not ideal.\r\n\r\nIf the optional settings approach isn't ideal, maybe some of these other solutions may be more appealing:\r\n\r\n- Add a small notification to the extensions tab as well? With it being so close to the other menu options it would be easier to spot\r\n- Move the cog above the `Finder` option and add a break line to separate it from the rest of the menu options\r\n- Add a somewhat noticeable gradient to the menu bar when vscode has an update? Nothing too bright like red. But the idea is to draw your eyes to the cog with a noticeable change\r\n\r\nThis is more of a quality of life suggestion rather than a need, so other user feedback would benefit this post more than others.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31218","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31218/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31218/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31218/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31218","id":244720197,"number":31218,"title":"Window

Open VSCode with parent folder above the folder containing package.json (so its not in the root) \r\n2. Click task in menu bar\r\n3. Click Run Task to get the list of auto detected scripts.
