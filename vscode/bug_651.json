It would be nice to display these big strings in a popup side-panel in a manner similar to how Eclipse does this.\r\n\r\nIt's actually one of the few ways in which Eclipse ui is 'better' than many other an IDE. Seeing the full doc for the method or type you are completing on easily accessible right next to the completions menu is, in my opinion, really convenient.\r\n\r\nvscode right now shows a kind of 'shortened' version of the documentation (which can look really uggly, depending on whether the original source looks good when you just strip out newlines to attempt to display it on a single line). vscode also provides a little 'info' button you can click which opens the 'detailed' view of the docs. This is not very convenient because the extra clicks and context switch between completions view and 'details view' makes it rather hard to navigate quickly between completions and see their respective docs before making a choice on which completion you really wanted to pick.\r\n\r\nNote: somewhat related. It would be nice if the 'side view' was capable of rendering markdown properly. But perhaps that is really a separate issue.
