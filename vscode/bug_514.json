VSCode Version: 1.9.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 8 and OS X\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download Python repo into the Extension directory:  \r\n```C:\\Users\\xxx\\.vscode\\extensions\\pythonVSCode```  \r\n```https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode.git```\r\n2. Open the ```pythonVSCode``` directory in VS Code  \r\n```npm install```\r\n```Tasks: Run Build Task```\r\n3. From debug Panel select ```Launch Extension as debug server```  \r\nOutput in debug console is as follows:  \r\n```\r\nnode --debug-brk=35378 --harmony out\\client\\debugger\\Main.js --server=4712 \r\nDebugger listening on [::]:35378\r\nwaiting for debug protocol on port 4712\r\n```\r\n4. Add a breakpoint into the debugger code  \r\n```src\\client\\debugger\\Main.ts```  \r\n\r\n5. Open another instance of VS Code   \r\n- Open a folder with a Python file  \r\n- Go into launch.json and add the following:  \r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n    \"debugServer\": 4711,\r\n    \"configurations\": [{\r\n            \"name\": \"Python\",\r\n            \"type\": \"python\",\r\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n            \"stopOnEntry\": true,\r\n            \"pythonPath\": \"${config.python.pythonPath}\",\r\n            \"program\": \"${file}\",\r\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\r\n            \"env\": null,\r\n            \"envFile\": \"${workspaceRoot}/.env\",\r\n            \"debugOptions\": [\r\n                \"WaitOnAbnormalExit\",\r\n                \"WaitOnNormalExit\",\r\n                \"RedirectOutput\"\r\n            ]\r\n        },\r\n```\r\n- Start debugging a simple python file with a simple print statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Expected: Debugger in VS Code should break into the extension debugger code, it doesn't.\r\n\r\n***NOTE*** \r\n- This used to work last year. Not sure when it stopped working.\r\n- No errors displayed in ```Console``` window of ```Developer Tools```  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20357","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20357/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20357/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20357/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20357","id":206660369,"number":20357,"title":"typescript references doesn't work on variables/methods that start with '$'","user":{"login":"spencerb02","id":7409744,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7409744?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencerb02","html_url":"https://github.com/spencerb02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencerb02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencerb02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencerb02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencerb02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencerb02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencerb02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencerb02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencerb02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spencerb02/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291055694,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/typescript","name":"typescript","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-02-09T23:22:39Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T00:32:47Z","closed_at":"2017-02-10T00:32:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.9.1 (f9d0c687ff2ea7aabd85fb9a43129117c0ecf519, 2017-02-09T00:26:45.394Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 6.3.9600\r\n- Extensions:\r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|html-snippets|abusaidm|0.0.19|\r\n|jshint|dbaeumer|0.10.15|\r\n|vscode-generate-getter-setter|DSKWRK|0.4.2|\r\n|gitlens|eamodio|2.0.2|\r\n|tslint|eg2|0.8.1|\r\n|vscode-npm-script|eg2|0.1.8|\r\n|git-project-manager|felipecaputo|1.0.1|\r\n|autofilename|JerryHong|0.1.3|\r\n|Angular1|johnpapa|0.1.16|\r\n|PowerShell|ms-vscode|0.9.0|\r\n|debugger-for-chrome|msjsdiag|2.5.3|\r\n|vscode-icons|robertohuertasm|7.2.0|\r\n|autoimport|steoates|1.2.2|\r\n|gitblame|waderyan|1.3.0|\r\n|vscode-todo-highlight|wayou|0.3.3|\r\n|html-css-class-completion|Zignd|1.0.3|\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
