Hold down `CTRL` while opening _file3_\n\nWhat this does, instead of creating a _third_ editor and having _file3_ open in this new editor (with _file1_ and _file2_ already opened in their respective editor), it opens _file3_ in the _second_ editor where _file2_ was previously living, and therefore replacing _file2_ in this _second_ editor.\n\nI believe a better behavior would be for _file3_ to open up in a new editor, no matter which editor the current cursor/focus is on.
