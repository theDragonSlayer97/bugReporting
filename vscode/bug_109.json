PR contains an experiment to apply the \"provider-pattern\" to our search logic (find *in* and *for* files). This is part of the larger remote development scenario. \r\n\r\n[edited with details and more ideas]\r\n\r\nThe API should cover two purposed, searching for and in files and IMO there should be two APIs/providers for this. Let's gather some requirements:\r\n\r\n### Search For Files\r\n\r\n**Ways to express what you are looking for**\r\n\r\n* simple patterns ala `*.png`\r\n* glob patterns ala `{**/*.test.ts,src/**/*.js}`\r\n* regular expressions\r\n* subsequent character matches, like `foa` matches `i Find characters in the Order in which they Appear in the query`\r\n* string substring match, like `foa` only matches `foa the people`\r\n\r\nFYI - today the extension API already allows to [`findFiles`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/joh/searchp/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L4785) and it allows to define queries using glob-patterns;\r\n\r\n**Results**\r\n\r\nI think it's fair to define the result as a stream of `Uri`s. They are easy to create and VS Code handles them well. Questions might be\r\n\r\n* Sorting/Ranking? Each provider might be smart and return results by it's own sort order. However, that is always local and it's not sure how they compare against each other. \r\n* Upper bounds? In VS Code we usually don't return more then 1000 results\r\n\r\n\r\n### Search In Files\r\n\r\n**Ways to express what you are looking for**\r\n\r\n* regular expressions\r\n* substring match\r\n\r\nUnsure if we need to define the exact regex feature set or if this should be more pragmatic and just be a best effort approach where each provider can decide how to interpret a query\r\n\r\n**Results**\r\n\r\n* We need a way to preview them in context. Today we use the full line of a match but that doesn't work well with very long lines. Maybe we spec the preview to be at least the matching range but ideally plus/minus N characters\r\n* Offsets or position bases? A search match inside a file must denote the location in that file. Our API always talks about positions (line and character) and not offsets. It might be a challenge for some providers to provide that information and we should be fit for that, e.g allow to fill in that information later.

is a regression from the Electron update and seems to be https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/9840\r\n\r\nI would argue that this blocks an Electron update unless we find a workaround. The problem is that during drag we no longer can find out if the dragged resource is a file or folder. Only when dropping it seems we can find out.\r\n\r\nWe need to know if a folder is dropped vs file to show different drop feedback:\r\n* dropping a folder shows a full drop feedback over the entire window to indicate that you open the folder\r\n* dropping a file is showing individual feedback depending on where you drop (over the explorer: copy file into the folder, over the editor: open the folder)\r\n\r\n/cc @kieferrm @Tyriar @roblourens
