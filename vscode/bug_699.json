I use SSH port forwarding to connect to remote debugger (as part of preLaunchTask). It works great. However there is currently no way for me to shutdown the SSH after debugging completes. \r\n\r\nIt will be great if there are something like 'postDebugTask' where I can run something to clean things up. This seems to be a common scenario for remote debugging.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.6\r\n- OS Version: Linux/Windows\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14815","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14815/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14815/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14815/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14815","id":186591162,"number":14815,"title":"New project template","user":{"login":"be5invis","id":240091,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/240091?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/be5invis","html_url":"https://github.com/be5invis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/be5invis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/be5invis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/be5invis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/be5invis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/be5invis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/be5invis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/be5invis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/be5invis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/be5invis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-11-01T17:14:52Z","updated_at":"2016-11-01T17:19:41Z","closed_at":"2016-11-01T17:18:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Initialize a project using predefined contents provided by plugins.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14814","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14814/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14814/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14814/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14814","id":186590262,"number":14814,"title":"Using mocha - describe and it are not defined","user":{"login":"kristianmandrup","id":125005,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/125005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup","html_url":"https://github.com/kristianmandrup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-11-01T17:11:28Z","updated_at":"2016-11-01T18:19:53Z","closed_at":"2016-11-01T17:43:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"How do I make the editor understand that `describe` and `it` are valid globals?\r\nI have an `eslintrc`, a `jscrc` and a `tsconfig.json` file.

Create a folder with one .html file with some indented html content and workspace settings.json (`F1` => `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings`). Define settings like this:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"editor.tabSize\": 2,\r\n  \"editor.insertSpaces\": true,\r\n  \"editor.formatOnSave\": true,\r\n  \"editor.renderWhitespace\": \"all\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Open the .html file, press `F1` > `Convert Indentation to Spaces` (or do this from the status bar). See that the lines are indented with spaces.\r\n3.

Unfortunately this does not provides a way to set width and height for images out of the box...\r\nThere is a way to configure a special renderer for it e.g.:\r\n```javascript\r\n renderer.image =

similar to the one [jira](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-30476) uses:\r\n```\r\n!projectavatar.png|height=250,width=250!\r\n```\r\n**Based on this a preffered syntax could
