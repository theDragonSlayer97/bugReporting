I am trying to embed C# highlighting in between single quotes (') and SQL in between double quotes. The problem is with C# highlighting. It seems that VSCode doesn't recognize ending single quote, and keeps the rest of the file in C# highlighting mode. Source of the extension project is on https://github.com/Hugibeer/RhetosDSL with sample test file to show the behavior.\r\nI am not really sure if this is bug in VSCode, maybe C# support for VSCode is treating ending single quote as a start of the character definition, or is this a question of which extension \"came first\" to evaluate the single quote. I think it is because Sublime Text doesn't have this issue :) If I am doing something wrong, please help me correct this.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.11.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
