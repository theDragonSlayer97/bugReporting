Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.11\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 64bit\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a simple javascript file in VScode 1.10\r\n2. Create a snippet for javascript(Babel) (e.g the default console.log() one)\r\n3. Test the snippet in the javascript file, the snippet works.\r\n4. Update VScode to 1.11\r\n5. Open the same javascript file. Now I couldn't use the above snippet and everything that should work on a javascript file(e.g. HookyQR Beautify Extension says \"it couldn't determine the file type\")\r\n6. Notice that every javascript file I opened in VScode 1.11 is automatically recognized as \"javascript react(Babel)\" on the bottom right corner of the editor, which should be \"javascript(Babel)\" instead.\r\n7. Manually change the bottom right corner to \"javascript(Babel)\", the snippet and extensions still don't work.\r\n8.

would like to extend the tslint.json rules file for building VCS\r\nthe goal would be to cover all of the formatting required\r\nby hygiene and the TS formatter.\r\n\r\nI killed a lot of time chasing formatting issues before realizing\r\nFormat would silently fix the errors(newbie mistake)\r\nit would still be nice to see the errors in real time\r\n\r\nSeveral  additions to the configuration file would pick up a few more things\r\n- I could not get all rules from tslint\r\n- we could add tslint-eslint-rules package and pick up most missing rules\r\n while keeping one file of rules\r\n- using two extensions and two configuration files seems inefficient\r\n- I do see a new eslintrc file not sure where it's used\r\n- I tested the above package and have almost all the currently\r\n missing rules doing real-time lint\r\n\r\nI will do a PR if interested\r\nChristopher\r\n\r\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/tslint-eslint-rules\r\n\r\n{\r\n\t\"extends\":
