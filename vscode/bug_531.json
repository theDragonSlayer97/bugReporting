https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/blob/master/src/goSuggest.ts#L187\r\n\r\nTwo questions:\r\n\r\n- Will `SnippetString` be added to `vscode-languageserver-types`?\r\n- Overall, should LS servers import types from `vscode` or `vscode-languageserver-types`?\r\n\r\n/cc @dbaeumer @jrieken

It should respect my selection. For example, if I have only 10 lines selected, it should re-indent those. If I don't have any selection, it should do the whole file.\r\n- The command is currently `editor.action.reindentlines`, proper casing would be `editor.action.reindentLines`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19847/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19846","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19846/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19846/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19846/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19846","id":205170588,"number":19846,"title":".NET Core Debugging stopped working in Visual Studio Code 1.9","user":{"login":"Cabeda","id":8181056,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8181056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cabeda","html_url":"https://github.com/Cabeda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cabeda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cabeda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cabeda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cabeda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cabeda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cabeda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cabeda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cabeda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cabeda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-03T14:23:55Z","updated_at":"2017-02-03T17:41:54Z","closed_at":"2017-02-03T17:41:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
