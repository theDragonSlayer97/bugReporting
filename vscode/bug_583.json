proposal for issue #12040 : Shortening the paths of the duplicate filenames.\r\n\r\nGoal\r\n- Path is shortened by replacing excessive info with ellipsis.\r\n- Every shortened path has only one match from the original paths. And vice versa for every original path there is only one shortened path that matches it.\r\n\r\nImplementation details and assumptions\r\n- For every path in the list we search for the shortest subpath that is not a subpath in any other path.\r\n- Last segment of the path is treated differently while checking for match as it's next to the filename.\r\n- Paths considered as case-sensitive when checking for subpath condition: 'a/b/C' and 'a/b/c' are different. The reason is: in the current implementation the filenames are case-sensitive meaning test.txt and TEST.txt are not duplicates.\r\n- Algorithm can be optimized later if needed. Usually the number of duplicate filenames is small.\r\n\r\nFuture updates (if this PR is accepted):\r\n- Always keep disk drive letter at the beginning of the path, same for schema:// (TODOs in unit tests).\r\n- Do not replace if path segment is short enough (one letter).\r\n \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18278","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18278/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18278/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18278/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18278","id":199433062,"number":18278,"title":"highlighting of matching react tags","user":{"login":"franckstifler","id":11504867,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11504867?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franckstifler","html_url":"https://github.com/franckstifler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franckstifler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franckstifler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franckstifler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franckstifler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franckstifler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franckstifler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franckstifler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franckstifler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franckstifler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-01-08T17:10:11Z","updated_at":"2017-01-10T01:56:12Z","closed_at":"2017-01-10T01:56:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.7.2\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

Set up git bash and your integrated terminal\r\n2. Ctrl + ` to open it up. Then type anything like \"npm install\". Next try backspacking to delete some characters and you will notice it might end up with \"np\" after backspacing all the way. If you press enter you'll see that you indeed deleted the entire command but it just failed to render properly. This happens in extreme frequency, I'd say >95% of the time which makes using the integrated terminal an extremely frustrating experience. \r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5633757/21751484/26dae65a-d596-11e6-978c-f46efcdf7a6f.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://i.gyazo.com/cf294567e65ae0d09afdff92610e8051.gif)\r\n\r\n![image](https://i.gyazo.com/c516e7a1f634a6549f49609da761e507.gif)\r\n\r\nLastly, this might be related to another issue in which the terminal window loses its position after being resized.
