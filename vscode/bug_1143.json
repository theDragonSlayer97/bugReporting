by issue #950 and pull #961\nAt Sublime I'm a big fan of ctrl+l (line select) and ctrl+shift+l (unselect and set multiple cursors at the end of each line selected).\nI've made a VSCode [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/bigous.vscode-multi-line-tricks) with this 2 features about 2 weeks ago... \nBut as the feature of LineSelection was incorporated to the VSCode itself and was released yesterday, I thought it would be nice to have both features at the VSCode itself.\nSo, I've made this little PR to set ctrl+alt+i to this action (sadly ctrl+l is used by another core feature and the chosen key combination for line selection was ctrl+i... ctrl+shift+i opens chrome dev tools inside VSCode, so I've chosen ctrl+alt+i to this feature).\nHope it helps people that are migrating from Sublime to VSCode like me

I'm not really understanding how vscode works.

Even with using a Unity Editor Plugin, nothing changes: We have only C# support without UnityEngine.UI, UnityEngine.EventSystems, UnityEngine.\\* and UnityEditor namespaces!\n\nAlso we don't have any Boo or UnityScript support when we're using VS Code, So we had to switch back to the MonoDevelop.\n\nWhat Unity Community wants from Visual Studio Code is:\n1. Implementing UnityScript and Boo Support\n2. Fixing assembly referencing problems (specially for UnityEngine.UI, but I think that it's a Unity problem, not an OmniSharp bug)\n3. Intellisense for Boo and UnityScript (by using Roslyn, since they're .NET languages)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1460","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1460/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1460/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1460/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1460","id":123036640,"number":1460,"title":"eclipse keymap ?","user":{"login":"rijine","id":1145401,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1145401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijine","html_url":"https://github.com/rijine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rijine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-12-18T22:26:10Z","updated_at":"2015-12-21T07:38:05Z","closed_at":"2015-12-21T07:38:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1459","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1459/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1459/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1459/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1459","id":123025910,"number":1459,"title":"Previous file functionality","user":{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-12-18T21:05:44Z","updated_at":"2015-12-18T21:07:36Z","closed_at":"2015-12-18T21:07:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Often while I'm using Code I want to go back to the previous file I was just at.
