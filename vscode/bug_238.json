would be great for extension developers to know where (between Windows and the Windows Subsystem for Linux) to find the needed dependencies.\r\n\r\nFor example now some extensions may require to run `ruby` or a gem (e.g. `ripper-tags`), git, etc. that you may have installed under WSL, but Visual Studio Code won't see them unless you install them on Windows too.\r\n\r\nAllowing the user to select whether by default these dependencies should be ran from Windows or from WSL would allow extension developers to support both scenarios.\r\n\r\nIn a way, I think you might have a primary target platform (windows, macos, linux) and an optional secondary one.\r\n\r\nThis is related to:\r\n- https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22663\r\n- https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28315
