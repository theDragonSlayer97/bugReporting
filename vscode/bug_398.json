alert:  I have been programming for 40+ years and used many different code editors, but I am relatively new to VSCode.\r\n\r\nI do not like any of the standard colour themes so I thought I would edit an existing theme or define a new one of my own.  You can do this easily in many other code editors.\r\n\r\nHowever, the documentation implies that all I can do is trawl through hundreds of themes for other editors (TextMate or Sublime Text) and convert them...  Yes, I have tried searching more widely, on StackOverflow and elsewhere. It seems to be a common issue for VSCode users.\r\n\r\nSurely, it should be possible to edit a theme in much the same way that settings are handled?  The theme should be specified ultimately with one or more (per language) JSON files that the user can edit or overlay.  Something somewhere in VSCode is doing the equivalent of parsing the text, tagging the components and looking up the right colour in a map.  That map could be loaded as a JSON file.\r\n\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: MacOS 10.12.4\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

that [whole code for updating](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/files/browser/views/openEditorsView.ts#L184) seems overly complicated and there seems to be many non structural events followed by one structural at almost the same time. Why don't you just always run through the delayer and refresh the groups as needed? Looking at the code you now seem to refresh groups on each event (if non structural) and then in the structural branch you end up refreshing the same group in some cases. Hard to understand that
