VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: Win 10\n- TypeScript Version: 2.0 beta (also set with `\"typescript.tsdk\": \"./node_modules/typescript/lib\"`)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create project with /src and /test folders.\n2. Create tsconfig.json with:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n        \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n        \"removeComments\": true,\n        \"preserveConstEnums\": true,\n        \"rootDir\": \"src/\",\n        \"outDir\": \"lib/\",\n        \"inlineSourceMap\": true,\n        \"inlineSources\": true\n    },\n    \"exclude\": [\n        \"node_modules\",\n        \"test\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n1. Run `npm install --save @types/node`\n2. Create /test/test.ts and import `assert`.\n\nThe `assert` import leads to \"Cannot find module 'assert'\".\n\nThe reason why I excluded `test` in `tsconfig.json` is that the tests should not become part of the lib/ folder. Also, I have a separate tsconfig.json in the test/ folder which gets used by mocha via `mocha --require ./test/init.js test/**/*.ts`:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"module\":

contains:\n\n``` js\nrequire('ts-node').register({\n    project: 'test/',\n    disableWarnings: true,\n    fast: true\n})\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10284","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10284/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10284/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10284/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10284","id":169833528,"number":10284,"title":"Indicate

the files for some odd reason.\n\nNow the files are going to stay bold until you open them, obviously it can be something different other than italic/bold but that's not really important.\n\nThis is

some delay before cursor animations is loaded. I'm not sure if that's by design and what exactly causes it (can't read .ts that well yet, let alone compile stuff to try it out). I would assume it's intentional delay that was originally used for blinking cursor. I think that new cursors could be used without delay, if every animation got inverted.\n\nEdit: It might be better to leave delay as is in order to avoid distracting animations while typing and moving cursor. In such case, blinking animation shouldn't be inverted, only the ones with soft transitions should.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10277/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10276","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10276/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10276/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10276/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10276","id":169801988,"number":10276,"title":"font size ","user":{"login":"rolandbrake","id":7880697,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7880697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolandbrake","html_url":"https://github.com/rolandbrake","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolandbrake/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolandbrake/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolandbrake/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolandbrake/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolandbrake/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolandbrake/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolandbrake/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolandbrake/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolandbrake/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-08-07T15:40:12Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T12:18:53Z","closed_at":"2016-08-08T12:18:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:1.4.0\n- OS Version:Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]\n\nhow to change the font size of intellisense list in vs code the font is too small to read \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10275","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10275/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10275/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10275/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10275","id":169801426,"number":10275,"title":"Integrated Terminal -

VSCode Version: 1.4\n- OS Version: All (Windows 8.1)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. At an existing git directory/repository which is opened in VSCode, which has no modified files, create a new file (which is not ignored at `.gitignore`) without staging it.\n\nCurrent behavior: At the left side, the git modifications icon will have a (1) number to indicate one change to the repository.\n\nPreferred new behavior as an option: don't count untracked files for this summary icon.\n\nSometimes there are legitimate reasons to have untracked files which are not part of `.gitignore` within a git dir. Maybe it's a temporary test, or a todo list, etc - it really depends on personal workflows.\n\nOn such cases, and especially if there are few such untracked files, the icon summary number becomes much less useful because it's always displaying some number, and it makes it quite harder, or even impractical, to glance and infer how many actual changes there are to files which _are_ tracked.\n\nObviously, depending on workflow, some may also prefer that the summary number does count untracked files.\n\nTherefore, I suggest to add an option to control if they're counted or not, and up to you if you want to generalize it further to control counting of other kinds of modifications.\n\nAs an example of an unrelated summary which ignores untracked files by default: git's own `git-prompt` (at the `contrib` dir) will only have the prompt \"modified\" indicator for untracked files if the user specifically set  `GIT_PS1_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES=1`, but by default it will ignore untracked files.\n\nI think it would be useful to allow such behavior for VSCode's summary icon too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10267","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10267/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10267/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10267/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10267","id":169794684,"number":10267,"title":"TypeScript

The root folder is not attached to git, its just a folder on my local which contains all the repos.\n\nIs it possible to do?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10259","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10259/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10259/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10259/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10259","id":169776880,"number":10259,"title":"Code completion is adding extra single quote when writing comments","user":{"login":"erictraut","id":7040122,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7040122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut","html_url":"https://github.com/erictraut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-07T02:52:34Z","updated_at":"2016-08-07T20:03:00Z","closed_at":"2016-08-07T20:03:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.4.0 (6276dcb0ae497766056b4c09ea75be1d76a8b679, 2016-08-04T16:45:31.680Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 6.3.9600\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
