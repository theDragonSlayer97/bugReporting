Have code open with git enabled on a repository (in particular, I'm working with @mozilla/gecko-dev)\n2. Do a `git rebase -i` that will take a while (my case had 11 commits that I was squashing into 1)\n\nA few times during the rebase, my rebase stopped because it couldn't create index.lock, saying it already existed. If I then did `git rebase --continue` things would carry on. (FTR, git also totally messed up the squashing in this case, but that's a git bug, not a code bug.) I realized that code's git integration was interfering with my rebase, quit code, `git reset --hard` to the original commit, and redid my rebase, and everything worked fine. My best guess is that the periodic `git status` (or similar) that code does was racing with the various commits of `git rebase`, and when code won, it would mess up the rebase. Code should probably avoid updating its internal knowledge of the working directory status while a rebase (or similar) is running. (Not sure if that's entirely possible, but it's at least something to think about.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5660","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5660/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5660/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5660/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5660","id":150407630,"number":5660,"title":"Formatting Html Component Files Does Not Work","user":{"login":"FoxNicolas","id":2904311,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2904311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoxNicolas","html_url":"https://github.com/FoxNicolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoxNicolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoxNicolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoxNicolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoxNicolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoxNicolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoxNicolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoxNicolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoxNicolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoxNicolas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":293381932,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/html","name":"html","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-22T15:56:03Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T17:43:37Z","closed_at":"2016-04-25T07:38:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.0.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
