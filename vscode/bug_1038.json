VSCode Version: 0.10.12-insider / All\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04\n- Debugging using Microsoft cpp debugger, but will happen in any \"stop-all\" style debugger. Note that this is an edge case, when a `STOPPED` event is sent by the debug adapter very close to a new thread creation. Also, this is not an immediate necessity. An April release fix is good.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Compile the following C++ code\n   https://gist.github.com/edumunoz/80275bd231abb56165eb\n   `g++ -g -std=c++11 -pthread vscode-repro.cpp -o vscode-repro`\n2. Set a breakpoint in line 7 (the body of the test() function)\n3. Start debugging. After hitting continue a couple of times, some of the threads won't have a callstack even if expanded.\n\nIn order to see it repro more clear, you can see the logging I added here https://github.com/edumunoz/vscode/commit/01a0e84d1b7bf613a027fd50764884de5e4c3192\n\n```\n[2438:0323/114759:INFO:CONSOLE(198)] \"new thread has started 8\", source: file:////home/edmunoz/code/vscode/out/vs/workbench/parts/debug/electron-browser/debugService.js (198)\n[2438:0323/114759:INFO:CONSOLE(169)] \"Recevied stopped event. The considered threads are  1 5 7\", source: file:////home/edmunoz/code/vscode/out/vs/workbench/parts/debug/electron-browser/debugService.js (169)\n[2438:0323/114759:INFO:CONSOLE(200)] \"now received the info about the new thread 8\", source: file:////home/edmunoz/code/vscode/out/vs/workbench/parts/debug/electron-browser/debugService.js (200)\n```\n\nThe debug adapter is sending the `THREAD` event before the `STOPPED` event (which is correct). However, since the `DebugService` queries the debug adapter for all the threads after getting a `started thread` event, there is a race condition between `STOPPED` and `THREAD`.\n\nThe result of this race condition is that, since by default threads are created with `stopped = false`, VSCode doesn't query for the `callstack` of those threads when calling `getChildren` on the `CallStackDataSource`.\n\n/cc @isidorn @weinand
