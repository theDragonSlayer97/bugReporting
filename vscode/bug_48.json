The issue reproduces even when I delete the entire .vscode directory.\r\n\r\nI suspect this isn't something specific to the Unreal Engine folder, rather just when the folder is very big, containing a significant volume of data.

have seen a slowdown in startup performance of 1.16 stable/insiders and could trace this to the fact that `product.json` now contains exe-based extension recommendation that are probed using `cp.exec`. \r\n\r\nDo the following:\r\n\r\n* checkout `origin/release/1.16` and build vscode yourself\r\n* due a few runs and write down perf numbers (F1 > Startup Performance)\r\n* now download 1.16 stable from our website and use its product.json-file for the self-build verson\r\n* measure again and see a severe performance hit between 500-1000ms\r\n* remove the exeBasedExtensionTips and performance is back to normal\r\n\r\nThe following things should be changed\r\n\r\n* Don't compute extension recommendation on startup as this isn't needed for a blinking cursor. Re-schedule yourself to run a few seconds after your service is getting instantiated\r\n* Don't use `cp.exec` but read the path-variable to check for the existence of a executable. @dbaeumer is the expert and has some code that does exactly that\r\n\r\n\r\nMy hand-written notes of the performance ticks: *App Ready, start window, window ready, code loaded, ...*.

proposed API for the color provider currently has a [knowledge of color formats](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/d225fc9ab2832d83626a098c25f6bf751e190485/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L110). Problem is these are language specific. In the case of CSS there are even [more formats coming](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#typedef-color).\r\n\r\nTherefore I'd suggest the following API instead of the currently proposed [resolveDocumentColor](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/d225fc9ab2832d83626a098c25f6bf751e190485/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L158)\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface DocumentColorProvider {\r\n// ...\r\n/**\r\n * Provide the string representations for a color.\r\n */\r\n   provideColorPresentations(colorRange: ColorRange):ProviderResult<ColorPresentation[]>;\r\n}\r\ninterface ColorPresentation {\r\n   label: string;\r\n   type?: string;\r\n   insertText?: string;\r\n   additionalTextEdits?: TextEdit[];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven a color value (e.g. `{red:1, green:0, blue:0}`) , the provider returns a number of possible presentations: (`#FF0000`, `rgb(255, 0, 0)`, `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)`, `red`) that apply at the given range.\r\n\r\nThe color picker can let the user toggle through the different presentations.\r\nWhile the color picker is open and the user looks at different colors, new presentation requests will be sent to the provider for each color value. The color picker label will be updated once the result arrives.\r\n\r\n- the request also contains the range of the color. That's for the case of embedded languages or languages that have location specific presentations.\r\n- the response has a mandatory `label` field which is used as label to show to the user in the color picker.\r\n- if `insertText`  is provided, the `insertText` will be used if the when the color picker decides to apply that color presentation at the given color range. If no `insertText` is provided, the `label` will be used as `insertText`.\r\nIf there is a need for it, `insertText` could also support `SnippetString`.\r\n- if `additionalTextEdits` are set, these edits can be additionally applied (e.g. for adding an import statement)\r\n- the `type` file is optional. The idea is that the same type of presentation (e.g. hsl) always gets the same type (`type: hsl`). That way the color picker can stick with the same presentation type while the user browses through different colors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34365","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34365/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34365/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34365/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34365","id":257661370,"number":34365,"title":"HTML close Tag  -
