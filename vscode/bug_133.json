Here these are:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// Wrap at the opening paren\r\nGetModuleBaseName(process_handle, modules, process_name, \r\n                  sizeof(process_name) / sizeof(TCHAR));\r\nGetModuleBaseName(process_handle,\r\n                  modules,\r\n                  process_name, \r\n                  sizeof(process_name) / sizeof(TCHAR));\r\n\r\n// Double indent to indicate wrapped line\r\nGetModuleBaseName(process_handle,modules, process_name,\r\n    sizeof(process_name) / sizeof(TCHAR));\r\nGetModuleBaseName(\r\n    process_handle, modules, process_name, sizeof(process_name) / sizeof(TCHAR));\r\nGetModuleBaseName(\r\n    process_handle,\r\n    modules,\r\n    process_name,\r\n    sizeof(process_name) / sizeof(TCHAR));\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth of these styles are not handled well by the auto indent logic. For example, copying this string (\\n included):\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n\r\nGetModuleBaseName(process_handle, modules, process_name, \r\n                  sizeof(process_name) / sizeof(TCHAR));\r\n```\r\n\r\nInto an empty line will result in:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nGetModuleBaseName(process_handle, modules, process_name, \r\n  sizeof(process_name) / sizeof(TCHAR));\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice the single (2) indent adjustment, forcing the user to realign the text (or press undo).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSince we know what the indent size is (2), perhaps a good way to accommodate this style of wrapping lines is to notice that the current line has a non-standard indentation and to not be as aggressive as a result. It gets a little complicated when you consider code copied from an external source and pasted in that may have differing rules though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31833","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31833/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31833/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31833/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31833","id":247154269,"number":31833,"title":"Images
