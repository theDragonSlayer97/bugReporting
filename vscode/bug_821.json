If you have to test on Windows, go through the `[Windows]` tests, etc.\n\nTo test monaco-editor:\n- clone the monaco-editor repository next to vscode, such that they are siblings. \n- do `npm install` in the monaco-editor repository.\n- run `gulp watch` in the vscode repository.\n- open `monaco-editor/test/index.html` in the browser you are assigned (file protocol is OK)\n- load the editor from `dev` such that it loads from the vscode repo:\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5047891/18070656/9d9c91de-6e4f-11e6-8335-7084d796e4d8.png)\n- your url should look like

For example the default is:\n\n``` json\n  \"terminal.integrated.commandsToSkipShell\": [\n      \"editor.action.toggleTabFocusMode\",\n      \"workbench.action.quickOpen\",\n      \"workbench.action.showCommands\",\n      \"workbench.action.terminal.copySelection\",\n      \"workbench.action.terminal.focus\",\n      \"workbench.action.terminal.focusNext\",\n      \"workbench.action.terminal.focusPrevious\",\n      \"workbench.action.terminal.kill\",\n      \"workbench.action.terminal.new\",\n      \"workbench.action.terminal.paste\",\n      \"workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText\",\n      \"workbench.action.terminal.scrollDown\",\n      \"workbench.action.terminal.scrollUp\",\n      \"workbench.action.terminal.toggleTerminal\"\n  ]\n```\n\nThis ensures that all terminal commands are handled to the keybinding handler in addition to accessibility tab focus mode, quick open and the command palette.\n\nSome things to test:\n- Whether it works as expected\n- Whether the default list of commands makes sense, think whether the default keybindings for these commands would conflict with command terminal programs\n- Whether any more commands should be added to the default list of commands\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11136","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11136/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11136/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11136/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11136","id":173875539,"number":11136,"title":"images
