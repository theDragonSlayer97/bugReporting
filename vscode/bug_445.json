In the typescript source, vscode shows the breakpoint as ignored but it will still get hit. If a breakpoint is only set in the transpiled javascript, the debugger will stop at the corresponding point in the typescript.\r\n\r\nAs the debugger is stopping in the correct place in the typescript, I'm hoping it is not a problem with the sourcemaps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Gulp file with the following:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst path = require('path');\r\nconst gulp = require('gulp');\r\nconst ts = require('gulp-typescript');\r\nconst tsProject = ts.createProject('./tsconfig.json');\r\nconst sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');\r\n\r\ngulp.task('build', () => {\r\n    const tsResult = tsProject\r\n        .src()\r\n        .pipe(sourcemaps.init())\r\n        .pipe(tsProject());\r\n\r\n    // from http://stackoverflow.com/a/34985647/7694968\r\n    return tsResult.js\r\n        .pipe(sourcemaps.write('.', {\r\n            includeContent: false,\r\n            sourceRoot: (file) => { return file.cwd + '/src'; }\r\n        }))\r\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('./bin'));\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.  \r\n```bash\r\ngulp build\r\n```\r\n3. Launch vscode debugger with:\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n\t\"type\": \"node\",\r\n\t\"request\": \"launch\",\r\n\t\"name\": \"Node\",\r\n\t\"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/bin/app.js\",\r\n\t\"cwd\":

This PR is a WIP currently.\r\n\r\n@vladima and @mhegazy can you take a quick look at the PR to see if it looks correct. I keep getting error from the TSServer that look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nshell.ts:468 Error processing request. Mismatched request id, expected undefined, actual 4\r\nError: Mismatched request id, expected undefined, actual 4\r\n    at Object.resetRequest (/Users/matb/projects/vscode/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/cancellationToken.js:57:27)\r\n    at IOSession.Session.resetCurrentRequest (/Users/matb/projects/vscode/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/tsserver.js:73291:40)\r\n    at IOSession.Session.executeWithRequestId (/Users/matb/projects/vscode/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/tsserver.js:73299:26)\r\n    at IOSession.Session.executeCommand (/Users/matb/projects/vscode/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/tsserver.js:73305:33)\r\n    at IOSession.Session.onMessage (/Users/matb/projects/vscode/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/tsserver.js:73325:35)\r\n    at Interface.<anonymous> (/Users/matb/projects/vscode/extensions/node_modules/typescript/lib/tsserver.js:74477:27)\r\n    at emitOne (events.js:96:13)\r\n    at Interface.emit (events.js:188:7)\r\n    at Interface._onLine (readline.js:232:10)\r\n    at Interface.<anonymous> (readline.js:365:12)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIt seems the expected request is never set. I think there is a bug on this line with `currentRequestId = currentRequestId`: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/6117ed77087b5d84774ee545bd3cad3d059caa75/src/server/cancellationToken/cancellationToken.ts#L51\r\n\r\nHere's a PR with a fix: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/14594\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n

Also added an example extension to show how this API would work\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Problem**\r\nThere have been requests for adding new functionality to the markdown extension preview, such as supporting rendering of math or other syntax in the preview. The only current solution to this is create an extension that provides its own markdown preview. This results in inconsitent behavior with our markdown preview and is not a very scalable approach. We would like to find a way to allow users to add these extensions to our markdown preview without bundling lots of additional packages with vscode\r\n\r\n**Fix**\r\nPrototypes a new contribution point that extensions can use to extend the vscode markdown extension. Three types of extensions are possible: adding stypes to the preview, adding scripts to the preview, and extending the markdown it renderer.\r\n\r\nMy current approach defines the contributed markdown extensions in the package.json using a structure like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"contributesTo\": {\r\n    \"vscode.markdown\": {\r\n      \"plugins\": [\r\n        \"./out/math\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"scripts\": [],\r\n      \"styles\": [\r\n        \"./media/math.css\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could change the structure here. This design uses a pull model where markdown extensions are looked up by the vscode.markdown extension itself.\r\n\r\nThe other approach for extension registration would be to use a push model. This would have the vscode.markdown extension export an api that each markdown extension would invoke to register new scripts/styles/plugins. I may switch over to this model but was interested in seeing what a more declarative approach would look like. Let me know if you have any thoughts one way or the other.\r\n\r\nThe downside of allowing extensions like this is that they can completely change how the markdown preview looks and works. There is no well defined API for restricting what markdown extensions can do","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4917","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"9B8F:366D:371EB8:7CBB47:59D93931","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=446>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=444>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"3125fcc78d8ea3c044b4561ea291871c\"","status":"200 OK"}}
