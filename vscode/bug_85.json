A decision should be done if these are two separate widgets or a single widget used in different ways.

the new debug API we need to register `DebugConfigurationProvider` early enough so that VS Code has them available when it needs them.\r\n\r\nSince `DebugConfigurationProvider` are typically registered in the `activate` function of an extension, we have to find a way to activate the corresponding extensions before debugging starts.\r\n\r\nI've tried to use these actions to activate the extension that registers a `DebugConfigurationProvider`:\r\n```json\r\n    \"onCommand:workbench.action.debug.selectandstart\",\r\n    \"onCommand:workbench.action.debug.configure\",\r\n    \"onCommand:workbench.action.debug.start\",\r\n```\r\nbut most of the time the registration in the extension does not happen in time for VS Code  to pick it up.
