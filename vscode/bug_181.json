Create extension using `yo code`\r\n2. Replace `src/extension.ts` with the code below\r\n3. Lauch the debugger and run the `Hello World` command\r\n\r\n```\r\n/// src/extension.ts\r\n'use strict';\r\nimport {commands,window,ExtensionContext} from 'vscode';\r\n\r\nexport function activate(context: ExtensionContext) {\r\n    let cmd = commands.registerCommand('extension.sayHello', sayHello)\r\n\tcontext.subscriptions.push(cmd);\r\n}\r\nfunction sayHello() {\r\n    doSomethingAsync()\r\n    .then(  res => window.showInformationMessage('Success!') )\r\n    .catch( err => window.showErrorMessage(err) )\r\n}\r\nfunction doSomethingAsync(): Promise<string> {\r\n    return new Promise <string> ( (resolve, reject) => {\r\n\r\n        // this works as expected (error popup shown)...\r\n        //                          vvvvvvvvvvv\r\n        // setTimeout( () => reject('Rejected!') , 250 )\r\n\r\n        // but this does not\r\n        //                       vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv\r\n        setTimeout( () => reject(new Error('Rejected!')) , 250 )\r\n\r\n   });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've confirmed that `reject(new Error('Rejected!'))` works as expected in vanilla node. It also works when attached to the chain returned by a `TextDocumentContentProvider`.  \r\n\r\nSame result if the extension is setup into `~/.vscode/extensions` and run without the debugger.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30368","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30368/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30368/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30368/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30368","id":241913819,"number":30368,"title":"BUG:
