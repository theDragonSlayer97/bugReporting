Problem\r\n\r\nCurrently, extensions that open the quick open are forced to autofocus the first element. There is no way to specify which item should be highlighted in a quick open menu when calling `showQuickPick`. This is problematic when using the quick open to navigate forwards or backwards in a stack of quick open menus for content drill down because the user loses their place in a larger list.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nAdd `IAutoFocus` options to `vscode.d.ts` file and add optional property to `QuickOpenOptions`. A possible nice to have would be to add another options for `autoFocusQuickPickItem` that accepts a quick pick item and reveals it in the tree.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27352/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27351","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27351/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27351/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27351/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27351","id":231748031,"number":27351,"title":"Task
