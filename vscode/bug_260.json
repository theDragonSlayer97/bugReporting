Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.12.2\r\n- OS Version: Wndows 10 CU\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.  Install the PowerShell extension and set the following user settings:\r\n```\r\n    \"editor.formatOnType\": true,\r\n    \"powershell.codeFormatting.openBraceOnSameLine\": false\r\n```\r\n2. To test the settings type the following `if (1) {<enter>` you should see PowerShell's code formatter move the opening curly to the next line (and complete the closing curly).\r\n3. Now try this with a PowerShell snippet which uses K&R style braces.  Type 'if' and select the if statement snippet.  Fill in the condition with `1` and tab to inside the statement.  Notice that none of this triggers the \"formatOnType\" signal to the extension.  Now technically, yes the user did not type the `{` and if the user would delete and retype the `{` the formatOnType would kick in.  But that is a major PITA especially when completing constructs like try/catch/finally.  \r\n\r\nIs there a way you could make formatOnType work with snippets?  I can't believe PoweShell is the only language where folks don't want the \"default formatting\" you get with snippets.  If VSCode would do this then folks could use the built-in snippets **and** get the formatting style they prefer.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28005","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28005/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28005/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28005/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28005","id":233450725,"number":28005,"title":"[insiders] Automatic HTML indentation and cursor position in JSX","user":{"login":"orangemooncreative","id":1316656,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1316656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemooncreative","html_url":"https://github.com/orangemooncreative","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemooncreative/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemooncreative/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemooncreative/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemooncreative/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemooncreative/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemooncreative/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemooncreative/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemooncreative/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orangemooncreative/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":344002046,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/candidate","name":"candidate","color":"fbca04","default":false},{"id":409283388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/caused-by-extension","name":"caused-by-extension","color":"E2A1C2","default":false},{"id":293381932,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/html","name":"html","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-04T18:26:40Z","updated_at":"2017-06-07T18:44:37Z","closed_at":"2017-06-05T17:57:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version:1.12.2\r\n- OS Version: Win10 x64\r\n\r\nI tried to ask this [question on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44123722/vscode-opening-a-folder-and-a-file-from-the-same-routine/44350415#44350415) but there were no single response for two weeks. Seems like this is a very specific question that only VSCode team can answer.\r\n\r\nThe code below will open the folder but not the file:\r\n```TS\r\ncommands.executeCommand('vscode.openFolder', \r\n                        Uri.parse('E:\\\\dev\\\\proj'))\r\n        .then(() => commands.executeCommand('vscode.open',\r\n                                            Uri.file('E:\\\\dev\\\\files\\\\file.json'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nYes I know why. After opening the folder the rest of the code is irrelevant as the extension host process is terminated. But this means that there is no way of opening a folder with a specific document opened.\r\n\r\nThis is a limitation that probably may be easily addressed in the `openFolder` implementation. For example an additional optional parameter `activeDocumentUri`.\r\n\r\nAs a work around I had to load document on VSCode loaded. It works but it's not elegant, slow and flickering. And, for this I had to configure the extension activation for as soon as possible - the activation technique that is officially discouraged in the VSCode documentation:\r\n\r\n>...please use this activation event in your extension only when no other activation events combination works in your use-case.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27989","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27989/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27989/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27989/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27989","id":233405779,"number":27989,"title":"Settings

Here are some ways we can mitigate this.\r\n\r\n- Don't add the unnecessary leading and trailing `|`s to each extension\r\n- Don't escape the `|` character in the grid, to save 4 characters per extension (with above)\r\n  - This works but apparently isn't a good idea. Maybe not reliable in every browser.\r\n- Truncate the extension list\r\n  - Kind of defeats the purpose of including it\r\n  - Maybe \"Report Issues\" button also opens an editor with the full list for the user to copy/paste\r\n- Don't include extensions which only contribute themes, which are probably less useful in issue reports\r\n  - This is easy and probably the most impactful. I have 17 theme extensions installed.\r\n- Truncate the publisher name, since it's only needed to disambiguate some extensions with the same name\r\n- Strip vowels...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27987/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27986","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27986/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27986/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27986/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27986","id":233400627,"number":27986,"title":"Please
