What I was expecting to be able to do was to use a selector like `operator.declaration` to color all `=`'s, and something like `operator.comparison` to target all `==`,`!=`,`===`,`!==`, etc..\n\nMaybe these are leftovers from TextMate theming?

I also had to [set the \"debugType\": \"portable\" in project.json](https://github.com/bitcrazed/HelloWorldCore/commit/7c34f86998dc53e0a0d4409e7e130f540890b0b0). (see [request to set this by default](https://github.com/aspnet/Templates/issues/650))\n\nI would have expected that since VS Code injected `launch.json` into the project, and that it had access to `project.json` etc. that it'd be able to determine the target-framework
