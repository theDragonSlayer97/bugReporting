`getCommitTemplate` method along the way. \n\nI've also [implemented the consuming part of this](https://github.com/bill-mybiz/vscode/commit/4753a000aefa9bb766012d3c6b6011c34b939353) similar as before, using `IStorageService`. I adjusted it to avoid the bug of blanking out the commit msg when unstaging a file. It also works for consecutive calls to \"Undo Last Commit\".\n\nIf you think there is a better way than using `IStorageService`, then it should be easy enough to change with how I separated these two commits. As it is though, it is working on my machine (Ubuntu 16.04).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9795","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9795/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9795/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9795/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9795","id":167646241,"number":9795,"title":"Only

So that's a huge hassle.\n\nWe really need either VS Code to honor imported Trusted Authorities from the Windows cert store, or a way to import a trusted cert into VS Code's special, unique snowflake cert store.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9790/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9789","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9789/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9789/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9789/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9789","id":167624705,"number":9789,"title":"Expanding a folder in the Explorer tab resulted in sub-tree being inserted in wrong spot","user":{"login":"JobLeonard","id":259840,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/259840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JobLeonard","html_url":"https://github.com/JobLeonard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JobLeonard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JobLeonard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JobLeonard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JobLeonard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JobLeonard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JobLeonard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JobLeonard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JobLeonard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JobLeonard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-26T14:41:25Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T15:04:00Z","closed_at":"2016-08-05T15:04:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.3.1\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04\n\nSteps to Reproduce: I have no idea, sorry :(.

are adding commands for fold/unfolding code in Vim and it turns out that Code's APIs are somewhat limited. All Vim's folding commands can be categorized as below.\n## Close/Open Folds (Done)\n\nVim allows users to open/close folds under cursor. Users can also decide how deep the folds are opened or closed.\n\nThese commands are partially supported, we have `editor.fold`, `editor.unfold`, `editor.foldRecursively`, etc and it's easy to map them to Vim commands. Besides, Code supports us to `fold` from level 1 to level 5 but level 6 and above is not supported and we don't have similar commands for `unfold`.\n\nVim even supports us to toggle Fold. We don't have this command in Code and we can't use `editor.fold` or `editor.unfold` to workaround as we have no idea whether we are inside a folding area.\n\n``` javascript\nexecuteCommand('editor.fold, {levels: 3});\n```\n\n``` javascript\nexecuteCommand('editor.unfold, {levels: 3});\n```\n## Fold creation/deletion\n\nVim allows users to create or delete folds manually. It's not possible here as Code is doing this for us.\n## Navigate through Folds\n\nWe can navigate to previous or next fold area through commands in Vim. If we want to implement this in Code, we need to know the info about all folds.\n## Fold options\n\nWe can configure max/min screen lines for a fold, max level for folds, etc in Vim. Again, we didn't expose them in Code.\n\n---\n\nThere are about 20+ unique commands and 10+ options about folding and we can only implement 5 of them partially right now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9786/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9785","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9785/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9785/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9785/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9785","id":167607537,"number":9785,"title":"Can't create a file in the root of a project if there are no files already there.","user":{"login":"TheSmokingGnu","id":1332395,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1332395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSmokingGnu","html_url":"https://github.com/TheSmokingGnu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSmokingGnu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSmokingGnu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSmokingGnu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSmokingGnu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSmokingGnu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSmokingGnu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSmokingGnu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSmokingGnu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSmokingGnu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":404225303,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/not-reproducible","name":"not-reproducible","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-26T13:30:41Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T18:17:58Z","closed_at":"2016-07-26T18:17:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.3.1\n- OS Version: 10.9 Mac\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
