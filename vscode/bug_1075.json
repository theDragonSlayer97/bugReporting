has like 5.4k votes on [uservoice](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/293070-visual-studio-code/suggestions/7752519-implement-tabs?tracking_code=421857240f4fcb6135eadecade77a4e2), it's unfortunate that an issue of _taste_ or style needs to be reviewed, it's like reviewing an issue about accessibility and debate whether it needs to be added to a modern program where the answer is definitely yes.\n\nI _think_ that the majority of developers either like it or just too used to it and some don't, that's fine too so why wouldn't you consider adding this as an option? many people that really likes the editor shy away from using it because an editor shouldn't force you into anything you don't like and the working files isn't working for many people.\n\nNow, I can certainly use other editors instead of VSCode and I do but when I'm working with TypeScript/JavaScript I really like to use VSCode and it really bothers me that it doesn't have tabs.\n\nI'm working with different languages and use many editors/IDEs in my work and all of them have tabs, it fits my workflow best because I've been using Visual Studio and IntelliJ to develop software for a very long time and it's just a thing for me and I guess for many others too.\n\nWhat's interesting is that Visual Studio Code carries the title Visual Studio that not only has tabs but it's part of the experience in the IDE so a developer that uses VSCode should expect no less but to have tabs as part of the same _editing_ experience.\n\nPlease, at least tell us what's going on with it, where it stands, etc...
