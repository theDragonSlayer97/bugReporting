VSCode Version: Version 1.11.2 (1.11.2)\r\n- OS Version: MacOS Sierra 10.12.4 \r\n\r\nI had a large build JS file open (from Webpack bundle) in VSCode with unsaved changes. I deleted the file from the command line as part of a build-script. Thus, the file no longer existed on the file system. Thus, when attempting to save and close all tabs, the editor prompted me to save this file; however, it then hung, and I was forced to force-quit VSCode. Now, every time I open VSCode, it reopens the file and immediately hangs. I've tried leaving for hours, force quitting, deleting vscode and reinstall (soft - I don't want to blow away all my extensions if possible), restarting, cleaning app memory and caches, etc. The file always re-opens whenever I open the folder where my project is. I tried renaming the folder and now the file opens in a separate window at least so I can resume working, but the file is still always around as an unsaved file (and again, its deleted from the file system OS). How can I delete it from VSCode's memory.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a large Webpack Built JS file. \r\n2. Delete it from the command line outside the editor.\r\n3. Attempt to close the editor - prompt for unsaved changes save\r\n4. Editor hangs\r\n5. Force quit\r\n6.
