On an otherwise fresh install of VSCode 1.15.1, using PowerShell extension 1.4.1, with user settings configured as follows. The global `editor.tabSize` is `5` only for illustrative purposes, of course.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"files.defaultLanguage\":  \"powershell\",\r\n    \"editor.tabSize\":  5,\r\n    \"[powershell]\":  {\r\n        \"editor.detectIndentation\":  false,\r\n        \"editor.tabSize\":  2\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Open a .ps1 script file containing the following code. Lines subsequent to the first are indented by **4** spaces.\r\n\r\n```\r\nGet-ChildItem -LiteralPath C:\\Windows\\System32 |\r\n    Where-Object {$_ -is [System.IO.FileInfo]} |\r\n    Where-Object Extension -in .cpl,.msc |\r\n    Sort-Object Length -Descending |\r\n    Select-Object -First 10 |\r\n    Select-Object Name,Length\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Notice that the status bar at the bottom of the VSCode window indicates the language is detected as **PowerShell**, and appears to show the language-specific `editor.tabSize` (**Spaces: 2**).\r\n\r\n4. Now right-click within the editor, and select **Format Document** from the context menu.\r\n\r\n5. The indentation will now be **five** spaces. The global setting has been applied, and the language-specific setting has been ignored.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: No","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33762","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33762/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33762/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33762/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33762","id":254898488,"number":33762,"title":"error message: Could not find module '../encodings'","user":{"login":"gbritton1","id":12263288,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/12263288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbritton1","html_url":"https://github.com/gbritton1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbritton1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbritton1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbritton1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbritton1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbritton1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbritton1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbritton1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbritton1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbritton1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":343063018,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/extensions","name":"extensions","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-03T20:26:22Z","updated_at":"2017-09-03T20:28:47Z","closed_at":"2017-09-03T20:28:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.15.1 (41abd21afdf7424c89319ee7cb0445cc6f376959, 2017-08-16T18:05:38.342Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro 64\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\nExtension|Author (truncated)|Version\r\n---|---|---\r\npython|don|0.7.0\r\ncode-runner|for|0.7.1\r\nmssql|ms-|1.1.0\r\ncsharp|ms-|1.12.1\r\nPowerShell|ms-|1.4.1\r\nvscode-autohotkey|sle|0.2.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
