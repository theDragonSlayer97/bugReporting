Ctrl-Shift-X to open Extensions\n2. Select \"Show recommended extensions\" or \"Show Popular Extensions\"\n\nFor a time it will show a blue indicator going from left to right, over and over for some time. Then nothing.\nNo error message. No nothing\n\nExpected result:\nWhen selecting \"Show Popular Extensions\" a list of one or more extensions should be displayed.\n\nI am behind a corporate firewall.\nI have added the following to my user settings (in my actual setting w.x.y.z is my proxy ip address):\n\n```\n// The proxy setting to use. If not set will be taken from the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables\n\"http.proxy\": \"w.x.y.z:8080\",\n```\n\n  \"https.proxy\": \"http://w.x.y.z:8080\",\n    // Whether the proxy server certificate should be verified against the list of supplied CAs.\n    \"http.proxyStrictSSL\": false\n\nThe same settings works in regular node environments. E.g. npm. Using the above settings I can use npm just fine.\n\nI note that there is a an error message in the console in Developer Tools:\nshell.ts:422 connect ETIMEDOUT 191.238.172.191:443\n\nThis ip address seems to be a Microsoft address, I am guessing it is the address of the marketplace?\nIs it ignoring my settings in the user settings

I'm a GStreamer (http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org) developer and I would like to be able to build gst with vscode.\n\nGStreamer uses recursive make to build itself. The way it works is that you run make at the root of the project and then make descends in the nested directories and builds the files contained in them (I'm simplifying but that's the gist).\n\nHere's what the build output looks like:\n\n```\nalessandro@june:~/src/gst1/head/gst-plugins-bad$ make --print-directory\nmake: Entering directory `/Users/alessandro/src/gst1/head/gst-plugins-bad'\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/make  all-recursive\nmake[1]: Entering directory `/Users/alessandro/src/gst1/head/gst-plugins-bad'\nMaking all in gst-libs\nmake[2]: Entering directory `/Users/alessandro/src/gst1/head/gst-plugins-bad/gst-libs'\nMaking all in gst\n...\n```\n\nAnd here's what a build error looks like:\n\n```\nmake[2]: Entering directory `/Users/alessandro/src/gst1/head/gst-plugins-bad/sys'\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/make -C applemedia\nmake[3]: Entering directory `/Users/alessandro/src/gst1/head/gst-plugins-bad/sys/applemedia'\n  CC       libgstapplemedia_la-vtdec.lo\nvtdec.c:38:1: error: unknown type name 'FOO'\nFOO\n^\n```\n\nSo as you can see the error references a relative filename (vtdec.c) and earlier in the output there's a line specifying in which directory the file is located (/Users/alessandro/src/gst1/head/gst-plugins-bad/sys/applemedia).\n\nvscode already supports relative filenames in problem matchers by letting users specify a static filePrefix to be prefixed to filenames. I'm proposing to add a method for problem matchers to modify the filePrefix as they scan build output.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11662","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11662/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11662/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11662/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11662","id":175651761,"number":11662,"title":"file package name and directory inconsistencies， delete import ","user":{"login":"rentiansheng","id":3955934,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3955934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rentiansheng","html_url":"https://github.com/rentiansheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rentiansheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rentiansheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rentiansheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rentiansheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rentiansheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rentiansheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rentiansheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rentiansheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rentiansheng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":386618042,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-09-08T02:37:41Z","updated_at":"2016-09-09T04:00:37Z","closed_at":"2016-09-09T03:29:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:1.4.0\n- OS Version: OS X EI Capitan\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.  create a new folder called test, create tow file called t1.go,t2.go\n    t1.go file  content \" package t1\",  t2.go  file content \"package t2\"\n2.  import test ,  use  package t1.var ,  save file vs code delete  import test.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11661","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11661/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11661/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11661/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11661","id":175648996,"number":11661,"title":"When i edit an png outside vscode , it will not change if i refresh","user":{"login":"fallenwood","id":11188646,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11188646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallenwood","html_url":"https://github.com/fallenwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallenwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallenwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallenwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallenwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallenwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallenwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallenwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallenwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallenwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-08T02:11:43Z","updated_at":"2016-09-08T05:09:55Z","closed_at":"2016-09-08T05:09:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: Windows10 RS1\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.  open a image(*.png) inside a workspace in vscode\n2.  edit the file with any tool( i am sure i saved)\n3.  close the image on the side bar but not vscode, reopen it, the image will not change even though i have changed it\n\nI think this is because vscode automatically cached the static image, i wonder if it is a bug or a feature.

In some of my projects, I've spun up a simple Node server to serve some assets while I work on the front-end, and then on occasion, after I've built out some functionality, I return to the server to deal with the XHRs that the front end sends.  It's useful to make changes, restart the server, and use the debugger to help reason with errors and the code.  When I press <kbd>F5</kbd>, the debugger quick access bar appears across the top with the debugging controls.\n\nIn previous versions, maybe a year to six months ago, there wasn't a handle to move it across the top, which means that it was stuck behind the file lookup box or any errors that showed up.  Now there is a handle, and it makes it so that you can move it out of the way of the command box.  But now the problem as I see it is that it's still hovering over tabs or options in the sidebar, and occasionally still covered by errors or notifications:  \n![2016-09-07 3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13950768/18325704/afe2e896-74ff-11e6-8dab-e280f9e393eb.png)\n\nPersonally, I would prefer for it to appear at the bottom or side, where generally it's out of the way of the many UI elements that could conflict with it.  The ability to change which side it's snapped to could be invaluable.  For instance, this example:  \n![vscode-debug-bar-right](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13950768/18326852/f1d94998-7504-11e6-90df-85cc3226f435.png)\n\nOr maybe even allow to stick it in the side toolbar:  \n![vscode-debug-bar-left](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13950768/18326878/1329ec24-7505-11e6-9ae9-be91ccabc860.png)\n\nThe idea is to keep it out of the way of all of the many UI elements that appear at the top of the screen so that there are no conflicts with it.  Adding the ability to snap the quick access toolbar to other sides would make it easier to deal with in that regard, and is only one proposed option for it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11651","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11651/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11651/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11651/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11651","id":175586800,"number":11651,"title":"VS Code will go into \"background\" mode if the window looses focus while the cursor is within the popup terminal but will not resume focus in the editor once you switch back.

Subsequent executions do not do this.\n### Reproduction Steps\n- Open VSCode\n- Open a project with a PowerShell script (in my case, a Pester test script)\n- Hit F5 to run the script\n- **NOTICE**: VSCode changes into debugging context, and script runs/exits\n- Go back to Explorer context in VSCode (CTRL + SHIFT + E)\n- Hit F5 to run the script again\n- **NOTICE**: VSCode doesn't change into the debugger context\n\nOriginally filed here: https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/283\n\nCheers,\n**Trevor Sullivan**\nDocker Captain\nMicrosoft MVP: Cloud & Data Center
