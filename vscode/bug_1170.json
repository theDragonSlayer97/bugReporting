looking to build an extension but one of the packages I need to depend on is a native module. When I do an `npm install` it installs the package just fine, I can launch a node shell and interact with it, etc. But when I go to use the package from within my plugin I get an error as it’s trying to load the ia32 build of the native module not the x64 which was compiled by node-gyp.\n\nA quick bit of debugging indicates that the problem stems by `process.arch` returning `ia32` when running in VS Code when my machine is a x64 machine (Win10 x64).\n\nSo is there some way to either:\n- Have VS Code run an x64 process\n- Have VS Code’s ia32 process do my npm restore (and subsequent compile with node-gyp)\n\nOtherwise I fear that my extension might be dead in the water :frowning:
