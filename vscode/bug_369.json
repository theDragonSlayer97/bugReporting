I was able to figure out root causes and fixes for a few of these cases, but decided its not worth chasing down these issues in emmet. Mainly because it is in maintenance mode and also, there might be more scenarios which we don't know. We can't fix what we don't know.\r\n\r\nTill now, we went around this issue, by assigning [incremental values](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/1.11.2/src/vs/editor/contrib/snippet/common/snippet.ts#L263) to such tabstops and [sorting](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/1.11.2/src/vs/editor/contrib/snippet/common/snippet.ts#L231) them so that they appear before the numbered placeholder.\r\n\r\nSo in `<input type=\"${1:text}\" class=\"${0}\" id=\"${0}\" style=\"${2}\">`, the order of tabstops would be\r\n- class\r\n- id\r\n- type\r\n- style\r\n\r\nwhich is not perfect, but this is the current behavior.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we replace the multiple ${0} with tab stops starting from the max stop + 1\r\n\r\nSo `<input type=\"${1:text}\" class=\"${0}\" id=\"${0}\" style=\"${2}\">`\r\nwill be `<input type=\"${1:text}\" class=\"${3}\" id=\"${4}\" style=\"${2}\">`\r\n\r\nAgain, not perfect or ideal, but we don't lose any tabstops which is important.\r\n\r\nWith this, we can not only fix #19246 but also pave the way for simplifying the way we do snippets\r\n(and remove legacy code, who doesn't like that? :) )\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24728","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24728/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24728/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24728/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24728","id":221706933,"number":24728,"title":"Keybinding Show Conflicts - confusing results","user":{"login":"seanmcbreen","id":1051190,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1051190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmcbreen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":297959291,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/keybindings","name":"keybindings","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-04-13T23:21:58Z","updated_at":"2017-04-27T22:20:36Z","closed_at":"2017-04-27T22:20:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Each time I ask to see conflicts I get a different list.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1051190/25027904/f1fa19f0-2064-11e7-9f24-077b733f09db.png)\r\n\r\nWhat I expected to see was the conflict and the appropriate sources listed.\r\n\r\nI can then clear the search and right click again to show conflicts...

We're going to work around this by moving the error location earlier, but we'd like to add the error to the end of the line.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1688 sounds related but different.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24710","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24710/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24710/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24710/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24710","id":221657086,"number":24710,"title":"Horizontal

Environment:\r\n\r\nOS: Windows 7 Professional SP1\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 15 Community \\ C++ Tools \\ SDK\r\nVS Code: 1.11.1 March release\r\nVS Code: 1.12.0 Insiders March 12\r\nVS Code: 1.12.0 March 7 master branch OSS build\r\n\r\nDragon Naturally Speaking DPI 14 (Voice/Dictation/Control)\r\n\r\nNode: 6.10.1\r\nNPM:  3.10.8\r\n\r\nDescription Of Bug:\r\n\r\nMenu handling on Windows 7 started to behave differently\r\nsomewhere between March 7 and the Insiders March 12 update.\r\n\r\nThe problem is somewhat subtle since it may pertain\r\nto voice control using Dragon. I believe for generic\r\nsoftware control in terms of menus, Dragon must utilize\r\nthe win32 API and messaging to detect the menus\r\nand control them with voice commands.\r\n\r\nPrior to the insiders March 12 (or close to that)\r\nthe stable VSC and insiders and OSS build March 7\r\nboth the top menu bar items as well as submenu items\r\nwere detected controllable by Dragon.\r\n\r\nNow Dragon can detect and utilize the top level menus\r\nbut the submenus are now unable to be activated.\r\nFrom of the feedback I can get from Dragon it appears\r\nit detects the list of submenus but cannot control them.\r\n\r\nI think this may also affect screen readers, but I do not\r\nknow for sure as I do not use one.\r\n\r\nI am also thinking it probably has to do with the electron\r\nframework/WindowsNativeInterface which I think has been updated or parts of it recently.\r\n\r\nThis is pretty big problem for accessibility and unfortunately\r\na big step back from prior operation.\r\n\r\nI'm already working to contribute to the VSC so I can\r\nprobably help debugging this.  I can do successive builds\r\nto try and figure out where the submenu started to fail after March 7\r\nbut having done this before it takes a long time especially by Voice\r\nand maybe there's already an obvious place to start ?\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24706","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24706/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24706/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24706/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24706","id":221648445,"number":24706,"title":"Can't reopen VS Code after it updates to 1.11.2","user":{"login":"brentonhouse","id":1746718,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1746718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentonhouse","html_url":"https://github.com/brentonhouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentonhouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentonhouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentonhouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentonhouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentonhouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentonhouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentonhouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentonhouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentonhouse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2017-04-13T18:42:13Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T09:03:38Z","closed_at":"2017-05-02T09:03:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
