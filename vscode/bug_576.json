I was going to report an issue with a slower VS Code recently, but then I found the cause & am reporting it to you.\r\n\r\nBasically, I recently noticed that startup time went up from ~2-3 seconds to ~6-7 seconds. More annoyingly, I usually start VS Code by searching for it in Start Menu & pressing Enter or left click. However, VS Code turned into the one application that upon starting from Start Menu would freeze the Start Menu for another 1-2 seconds. Normally, Start Menu closes instantly, and VS Code was the one app causing such odd behavior.\r\n\r\nAfter playing around, I tracked down the issue - I recently installed [Malwarebytes ](https://www.malwarebytes.com/premium/) and keep it running in the background. Whilst it is turned on, VS Code is much slower. When I turn Malwarebytes off, VS Code returns to starting very quickly & Start Menu closing instantly,\r\n\r\nI wonder if reporting this symptom could be useful to you & if something could be done about it in some future version (unless it's just me :) ) .\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18513","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18513/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18513/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18513/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18513","id":200628437,"number":18513,"title":"Mixed keyboard menu shortcuts","user":{"login":"kumarharsh","id":760112,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/760112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh","html_url":"https://github.com/kumarharsh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":421131022,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/as-designed","name":"as-designed","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-13T13:18:56Z","updated_at":"2017-01-21T13:58:34Z","closed_at":"2017-01-21T13:58:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
