far as I can tell, there is no way to clear the list of recently opened files that appears on the CMD+P window.\n\nMy problem: I have excluded node_modules from searching. Sometimes I open a package.json file from inside node_modules by navigating from the explorer. \n\nAfter that, CMD+P then typing 'package.json' shows all of the package.json files that are in the recently opened list, even though some are from the node_modules directory which is normally excluded from search. \n\nThis can be useful behavior, but the user should be able to clear out the recently opened list so that the search exclusion rules can go back to hiding those files. \n\nThere should be a clear all recently opened files button/command. It may be worth considering a way to clear specific items with an 'x' on the open file dialog that appears with CMD+P. Or perhaps a special command for clearing recently opened files that match any search exclusion rules.\n\n![screen shot 2016-02-22 at 11 46 37
