Unfortunately, it will ignore the user setting _\"emmet.extensionsPath\"_.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. in _settings.json_:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"emmet.extensionsPath\": \"path to\\\\Emmet Settings\",\r\n    \"emmet.useNewEmmet\": true,\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. In _**Emmet Settings**_ directory set above there is a custom _snippets.json_ file containing for instance:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"variables\": {\r\n\t\t\"charset\": \"UTF-8\",\r\n\t\t\"indentation\": \"\\t\",\r\n\t\t\"lang\": \"fr\",\r\n\t\t\"locale\": \"fr-FR\",\r\n\t\t\"newline\": \"\\n\"\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"html\": {\r\n\t\t\"abbreviations\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"doc\": \"html>(head>meta[charset=${charset}]+meta:vp+meta:edge+title{${1:Document}})+body\",\r\n\t\t\t\"html:5\": \"!!!+doc[lang=${lang}]\"\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t\"filters\": \"html\",\r\n\t\t\"profile\": \"html\",\r\n\t\t\"snippets\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"!!!\": \"<!DOCTYPE html>\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. In a HTML file use the emmet **_html:5_** snippet\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n\r\nCustom emmet snippets are ignored. Lang applied is **_\"en\"_**. Same goes for any emmet custom snippets in `\"emmet.extensionsPath\": \"path to\\\\Emmet Settings\"`: html, css, etc.\r\n\r\nIt will work as intended if  `\"emmet.useNewEmmet\": false`\r\n\r\nI hope this incompatibility issue with custom emmet settings will be solve.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28464","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28464/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28464/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28464/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/28464","id":235077328,"number":28464,"title":"Implement

When a user types a letter which triggers code completion extensions must first be able to process this new input (e.g. parse the document) to find proper completion candidates. Otherwise the new input is not considered and wrong candidates are listed. Hence the order should be switched. If that is not possible or feasible it should be possible to trigger code completion from the text change handler and suppress the standard invocation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Use an extension with both a completion provider and the `workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument` event.\r\n2. Open a document which triggers this extension.\r\n3. Add breakpoints in `provideCompletionItems` in the completion provider and `workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument`.\r\n4. Type a letter and watch the order both breakpoints are hit (completion comes first).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28457","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28457/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28457/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28457/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28457","id":235064755,"number":28457,"title":"Give

Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.13.0\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.12.5\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. open a new file (set syntax to javascript)\r\n2. paste this code in the file\r\n```javascript\r\nimport Vue from 'vue';\r\nimport Router from 'vue-router';\r\n\r\nVue.use(Router);\r\n\r\nexport function createRouter () {\r\n  const router = new Router({\r\n    mode: 'history',\r\n    scrollBehavior: () => {\r\n      return { y: 0 };\r\n    },\r\n    routes: [\r\n      {\r\n        name: 'home',\r\n        path: '/',\r\n        component: () => import('@/views/Home'),\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        name: 'about',\r\n        path: '/about',\r\n        component: () => import('@/views/About'),\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        name: 'faq',\r\n        path: '/faq',\r\n        component: () => import('@/views/Faq'),\r\n      },\r\n    ],\r\n  });\r\n  \r\n  return router;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. check problems view to see the reported errors.\r\n4. You can see that after it failed on `import(` lines, validator could not recover. it keeps on failing on every statement after that.\r\n5. replace the contents with this code\r\n```javascript\r\n// Fails correctly\r\nconst x = {\r\n  foo: import('./myModule'),\r\n  bar: 'bar string',\r\n  x: import('./myModule2'),\r\n  foobar: 1234,\r\n  method() {\r\n    return bar;\r\n  },\r\n  array: [{}],\r\n  method2: () => {}\r\n}\r\n\r\n// fails correctly\r\nconst y = {\r\n  x: {\r\n    foo: import('./myModule'),\r\n    bar: 'bar string',\r\n    x: import('./myModule2'),\r\n    foobar: 1234,\r\n    method() {\r\n      return bar;\r\n    },\r\n    method2: () => {}\r\n  },\r\n  bar: [],\r\n  z: {\r\n    name: 'string'\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Fails wrong.\r\n// Rest of the object gets effected\r\nz = {\r\n  x: [\r\n    {\r\n      foo: import('./myModule'),\r\n      bar: 'bar string',\r\n      x: import('./myModule2'),\r\n      foobar: 1234,\r\n      method() {\r\n        return bar;\r\n      },\r\n      method2: () => {}\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n  bar: {\r\n    foo: 'this object got broken'\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n6. See that erroring on `import` statement sometimes works correctly\r\nfirst two examples works ok, but last example breaks the validator. seems to be related to `[]`\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAlso related feature request:\r\n\r\nDynamic imports are still on proposal stage but they are usable with babel and I can allow them on eslint. but there is no way to allow them on default validator. I know I can simply disable `javascript.validate` but it's useful and I don't want to disable it for one simple feature I use.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there is a way to disable validator for lines or files only, something like `// eslint-disable-line`?\r\n\r\nbut it would be nice to have a way to tell validator to stop validating on some files or lines.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28449","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28449/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28449/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28449/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28449","id":235052110,"number":28449,"title":"Minimap disappears when closing Peek Definition window","user":{"login":"TanelS","id":3945553,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3945553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanelS","html_url":"https://github.com/TanelS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanelS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanelS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanelS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanelS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanelS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanelS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanelS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanelS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanelS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":543648956,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-minimap","name":"editor-minimap","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-11T08:43:07Z","updated_at":"2017-06-21T16:03:46Z","closed_at":"2017-06-12T18:36:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
