A new 'Attach to Process' launch config uses the variable to let the user pick a 'node' process when running the launch config.\n- Verify that this process picker behaves correctly on every platform.\n- Try to break it.\n\nVerify that the mechanism can be used by extension authors:\nCreate a new command variable that maps to another command, e.g. some string input UI that asks for a host id, or a picker that gets some QuickPick choices from the launch config, and returns the selected item.\n\nThe simplest way to do this is:\n- clone `https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-node-debug.git`\n- add a new command in `src/extension.ts`\n- add a new 'variable' to the `debuggers` contribution point in the `package.json`\n- run the extension with F5\n- try to use it in a launch config that passes the variable as an argument in the `args` attribute to a simple node program that prints the arg.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8195","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8195/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8195/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8195/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8195","id":162464128,"number":8195,"title":"Test
