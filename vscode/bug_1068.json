goto definition and the back and forward functionality is a really great way to code, and is the main reason I have switched to VScode. Unfortunately, I often have to scroll back through a long history of cursor movements in the current file before reaching the previous file, which is where I wanted to go in the first place.\n\nI can imagine this could be useful for editing long files, but 90% of the time I'm using the history to navigate between files. The sweet spot for me would be to only add cursor movements of over 50 lines to the history. Is there any way to make this configurable? I would even be happy with excluding cursor movements within a file from the history completely, as it would be better than the status quo.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3735","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3735/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3735/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3735/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3735","id":138632457,"number":3735,"title":"Build task hangs when no output","user":{"login":"AlexeyRaga","id":1394391,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1394391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyRaga","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexeyRaga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyRaga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyRaga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyRaga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyRaga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyRaga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyRaga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyRaga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyRaga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexeyRaga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":292032114,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/tasks","name":"tasks","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":291057332,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/verified","name":"verified","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-05T01:50:40Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T10:44:25Z","closed_at":"2016-03-09T14:31:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Some incremenral compilers (e.g. GHC/Stack) will not give any output when compiling sources with no changes since the previous compilation.\n\nIt looks like when a build task is set up to call such a compiler VS Code \"hangs\" because it expects some output.

Code needs a UTF-8 with and without encoding (or more friendly with and without BOM) option when you do save with encoding.\n\n**More Info**\nUnlike Notepad++ which has easy to read menu options for encoding or Visual Studio which as Advanced Save Options which clearly spell out UTF-8 with encoding and without encoding, VS Code makes it very tedious to discover if your file has been saved with or without the BOM. \n\nThis is critically important when saving markdown files in GitHub and using their pages feature - which renders in Linux via Jekyll - because if you get this wrong (like when saving via Notepad) - you can't easily identify the problem - your page just won't render. \n\nA typical dev test to figure this problem out is to use Notepad++ to check the encoding (or more complex is to run Jekyll locally and read the debug output).

recently updated typescript, angular, and basically every library in my project. Before I did this update the problem didn't exist. From the command line I've ensured that my code builds without errors or warnings. However, when I open the project in Visual Studio Code and make changes to a file it starts highlighting stuff as errors.\n\nIt highlights my imports at the top saying `cannot find module 'angular2/core'.` and my `@Components`, `@Output`s and `@Input`s say `Experimental support for decorators is a feature that is subject to change in a future release. Specify '--experimentalDecorators' to remove this warning.` It's also highlighting some of my `Window` properties that I have declared in a `.d.ts` file.\n\nYet this is my tsconfig.json:\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n    \"inlineSourceMap\": true,\n    \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n    \"removeComments\": false,\n    \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n    \"noImplicitReturns\": true,\n    \"pretty\": true\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [ \"node_modules\" ]\n}\n```\n\nIt seems that when I change a file VSCode is building the single file I just changed without using my tsconfig. If I build from the command line I get zero errors or warnings. If I press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> to run the build inside VSCode then all the errors go away.
