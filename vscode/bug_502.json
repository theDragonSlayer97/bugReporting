Clicking Show Recommendations presents a list of extensions that does not include any titled \"SQL\", the closest would be the Microsoft SQL Server-specific \"mssql\" extension. Searching all extensions for the substring \"SQL\" shows no extension with the title of simply \"SQL\".\r\n\r\nIf the intent of the notice is to encourage the user to select one of the SQL-related extensions, e.g., mssql, PL/SQL, vscode-database, then the Show button should take the user to a list of extensions tagged as SQL related, and the wording of the notice should be corrected, as \"the 'SQL' extension\" means one specific, so named extension.\r\n\r\nIf there is/was a specific extension simply called \"SQL\" that is not available at this moment, the notice could be removed or linked directly to that extension. Even if the extension is not available, it would be a clearer user-experience to click Show… and be taken to a \"this extension is no longer available\" page.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20731","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20731/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20731/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20731/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20731","id":208132787,"number":20731,"title":"CPU has been drained by PHP7.0 process","user":{"login":"siderlan","id":3153761,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3153761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siderlan","html_url":"https://github.com/siderlan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siderlan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siderlan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siderlan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siderlan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siderlan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siderlan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siderlan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siderlan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siderlan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-16T14:14:35Z","updated_at":"2017-09-04T05:23:36Z","closed_at":"2017-09-04T05:23:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The CPU usage is about 100% when the editor is started.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: Code 1.9.1 (f9d0c687ff2ea7aabd85fb9a43129117c0ecf519, 2017-02-08T23:44:55.542Z)\r\n- OS Version: Linux x64 4.4.0-62-generic\r\n- Extensions:\r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|format-php|Kasik96|1.1.2|\r\n|material-icon-theme|PKief|1.3.3|\r\n|githistory|donjayamanne|0.1.5|\r\n|prettier-vscode|esbenp|0.8.0|\r\n|php-intellisense|felixfbecker|1.1.1|\r\n|classic-asp|ilich8086|0.0.2|\r\n|php-symbols|linyang95|2.1.0|\r\n|wordpress-snippet|tungvn|1.1.2|\r\n|Material-theme|zhuangtongfa|1.0.3|\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
