Open a diff split view\r\n2. Click into the left side (focus is now on the left \"editor\")\r\n3. Click on the statusbar, file tree, something that won't open another editor\r\n4. The left lost focus (correct), but now the active editor (extensions receive an `onDidChangeActiveTextEditor` event) is the right side (but still don't have focus which is fine)\r\n\r\nYou can notice this behavior much more easily with an extension like GitLens which provides \"active line\" annotations (you'll see them switch from the left side to the right) and statusbar updates. In GitLens specifically this causes an issue when a statusbar item is updated because of line selections on the left, and then you attempt to click on the statusbar item (to perform an action), but it fails, because the active editor switches out from under the click.\r\n\r\nI've also noticed, when looking into this, that the line information in the statusbar isn't updated to reflect the line/column/selection of the left side -- only the right.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22402","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22402/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22402/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22402/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22402","id":213393896,"number":22402,"title":"zh-CN

If we navigate deep into the project, we always need to identify how many `../`'s needs to be made before we can reach the root and navigate. Instead, since vscode know the project root directory, it would be better if vscode can allow navigation/shell expansion relative to project root along the lines of `~`\r\n\r\nFor e.g,\r\n\r\nIf the project is located at `/home/user/myproject`, and the user at the following path within terminal `/home/user/myproject/root/child/grandchild/`\r\n\r\ncurrently if the user need to reach home, he either need to close the terminal & reopen (in which case, he would lose the history)/naguivate using `cd ../../../`\r\n\r\nThe problem with the second approach is, its waste of time identifying how many backs you need to do with elipses.\r\n\r\nInstead if we have something like `^`(or anyother single character) which is similar to user home `~`, that vscode expands as `<project root>`, then the developers life would be much simpler to navigate within the project\r\n\r\nThis way if the user needs to navigate to `/home/user/myproject/root/child2`, irrespective of where he is in the terminal, he can just do `cd ^/child2`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22394","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22394/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22394/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22394/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22394","id":213345059,"number":22394,"title":"formatting
