I recently switched to VS Code and what I noticed is that having a global counter of file errors is handy. However, when say an error is not valid because the language doesn't support something yet, it is annoying to have these errors.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the CSS linter, there is an issue where the `@supports` rule isn't supported yet, or that the `/deep/` selector for Angular 4 isn't properly recognized. To make the errors go away I have to disable linting or (perhaps) disable rules that I don't want to disable. \r\n\r\nAlso you can't limit the linter to only look at the existing file and get an overview of only that, so you are pretty limited to what you can and cannot do.\r\n\r\nSo my request is to extend the linting solution to allow errors to be hidden. Rightclick one and select `Hide error for this workspace` or something similar. And an option `only show errors for current file` would also be nice.\r\n\r\nI also found out that it is pretty eager to validate my `node_modules` folder as well. I feel we also need a setting for workspace to specify linting exclusions (and/or globally)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30989/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30988","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30988/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30988/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30988/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30988","id":243953078,"number":30988,"title":"Bottom panel height is maximized after resizing VSCode window","user":{"login":"Danthar","id":986519,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/986519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danthar","html_url":"https://github.com/Danthar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danthar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danthar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danthar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danthar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danthar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danthar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danthar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danthar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danthar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-07-19T07:56:30Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T07:48:59Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.14\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

working all the time.  Specifically, if I open VSCode and it restores the windows from a previous session, it doesn't display the custom view even though the current file matches the language ID.  Sometimes, after clicking around various documents, opening/closing new ones, it will finally show up.\r\n\r\nDoes something need to happen to set the resourceLangId when launching VSCode?  The extension is for a custom language, which detects files from the filenamePatterns in the package.json.  Is the resourceLangId not checking against it or is the URI not being set properly from it so that resourceLangID is set?\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"contributes\": {\r\n    \"languages\": [\r\n        {\r\n
