for #26948\r\n\r\n- [x] Windows @rebornix \r\n- [x] OS X @jrieken \r\n- [x] Linux @weinand \r\n\r\nComplexity: 4\r\n\r\n## What to do - Code :) \r\n\r\nWrite an extension that contributes a tree view to the Explorer using following steps\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n- Copy [vscode.proposed.d.ts](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) into your extension.\r\n- Enable your extension to use proposed api by adding following flag to `package.json`\r\n```\r\n\"enableProposedApi\": true\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. Contribute a view using the extension point `views`.\r\n2. Implement and register a tree data provider to this contributed view using the [API](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L15:L110). API should be self explanatory.\r\n\r\n### Activation\r\n- Extension can be made activated on activation event `onView:${id}`.\r\n\r\n### Menus\r\nContribute commands using `menus` extension point at following locations\r\n- `view/title` - Supported groups are `navigation`.\r\n- `view/item/context` - No groups are supported. These commands will be called with your model element representing tree item as first argument.\r\n- Context keys to represent view and view items in `when` clause are `view` and `viewItem` respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/tree-explorer-sample)\r\n\r\n## What to Test ?\r\n\r\n1. Make sure that the tree view is shown in the explorer. Validate the tree by navigating down. \r\n2. Make sure the extension is activated only when you expanded the view.\r\n3. Make sure the command provided for tree item is called when the tree item is selected.\r\n4. Make sure actions on title bar and on item are shown and called.\r\n5. Make sure the view collapsible state and size is restored on refresh.\r\n\r\nPlay around and please provide feedback on the api and issues all through this repository.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27466","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27466/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27466/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27466/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27466","id":232070836,"number":27466,"title":"Add variable to tasks.json for currently selected text","user":{"login":"ptashka-berkut","id":4138118,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4138118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptashka-berkut","html_url":"https://github.com/ptashka-berkut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptashka-berkut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptashka-berkut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptashka-berkut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptashka-berkut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptashka-berkut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptashka-berkut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptashka-berkut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptashka-berkut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptashka-berkut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":292032114,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/tasks","name":"tasks","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/27","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/27","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/27/labels","id":1951901,"number":27,"title":"On Deck","description":"The Issues assigned to the **On Deck** milestone under consideration for the upcoming milestones.\r\nOur goal is to always have less than 100 Issues on deck.","creator":{"login":"egamma","id":172399,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/172399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma","html_url":"https://github.com/egamma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":169,"closed_issues":10,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-08-19T16:02:12Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T07:53:40Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-29T17:35:03Z","updated_at":"2017-05-29T20:39:28Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Variable substitutions that are available for tasks.json (see [Integrate with External Tools via Tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_variable-substitution)) do not include currently selected text.

we decide to keep the global activity action in the bottom of the activity bar, I suggest to tackle some debt associated with it:\r\n\r\n* we introduce a [new registry](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/browser/activity.ts#L27) for global activity which seems odd, instead I suggest to use the already existing [`GLOBAL`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/browser/actions.ts#L64) scope within `IActionBarRegistry` that can be used to register an action bar contributor for this scope. the activity bar part can then easily read out those actions from the global scope and use them\r\n* instead of introducing a new type `IGlobalActivity` that has to return actions that will show on click in the context menu we should just register an instance of `IAction` that inside its `run` method shows actions using the context menu service\r\n\r\nGiven these changes, I think we no longer need `activity.ts` and we basically have the old concept we used to have which is to register a global action that just implements everything through the `run` method.\r\n\r\n/cc @joaomoreno

[smoke test](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Smoke-Test). To ensure its stability, it is important to run it on different machines.\r\n\r\n## Running automated test\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n1. Update stable to the latest version.\r\n2. Close all VS Code instances that will be used in a test (e.g. latest insiders, stable) not to have any interference with the running test that will spawn them itself.\r\n\r\nOnce the test is running, please do not interfere with it by doing selection or focusing anywhere within spawned test VS Code instance.\r\n\r\n### Approximate running time\r\n10 minutes minimum (the more failures it has, the more it runs due to adaptive retry strategy of the waiting time).\r\n\r\n### Procedure\r\n1. Run `git checkout michelkaporin/smoketest` in `vscode` repository. Currently the code lives on my branch only.\r\n2. `cd test/smoke`\r\n3. `npm install`\r\n4. `npm test -- --latest \"path/to/binary\" --stable  \"path/to/binary\"`, where `latest` argument is the path to VS Code executable to conduct testing, and `stable` is previous stable version (in order to run 'Data Migration' tests). If the latter argument is ommited, 'Data Migration' tests won't run.\r\n\r\n_Example commands:_\r\n`npm test -- --latest \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft VS Code Insiders\\Code - Insiders.exe\" --stable \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft VS Code\\Code.exe\"` \r\nor\r\n`npm test -- --latest \"/Applications/Visual Studio Code - Insiders.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron\" --stable \"/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron\"`\r\n\r\n## Known problems\r\n- **#27452 bug results in very many failing tests on OS X, once that is fixed, all should pass.\r\n- Spectron spawns multiple cmd windows on Windows OS. This leads to VS Code window to be overlapped by another one. To look at what the test does you need to click on the VS Code title bar to focus on it in every test. (https://github.com/electron/spectron/issues/60)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you get failing tests, please dump the log with failed error messages here. \r\nAny feedback is appreciated 👍 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27455","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27455/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27455/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27455/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27455","id":232037959,"number":27455,"title":"tasks: lots of space between rows in the task of ts_watch_mode","user":{"login":"ysneo","id":17615113,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17615113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysneo","html_url":"https://github.com/ysneo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysneo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysneo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysneo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysneo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysneo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysneo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysneo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysneo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ysneo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-05-29T14:29:49Z","updated_at":"2017-05-30T08:54:00Z","closed_at":"2017-05-30T08:54:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.12.2 (19222cdc84ce72202478ba1cec5cb557b71163de, 2017-05-10T13:20:36.315Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.15063\r\n- Extensions: I disable all the extensions \r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
