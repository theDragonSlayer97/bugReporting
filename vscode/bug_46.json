using text editor decorations to annotate the closing brackets of nested constructs to improve code readability for things like Flutter widgets (these methods have lots of nested calls, similar to React render methods):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"648\" alt=\"Dart Code 'closing labels'\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1078012/29241650-ba59f40a-7f75-11e7-9415-176ce3fd057f.png\">\r\n\r\nOriginally I anchored the decorations to the closing bracket, but when multiple items ended on the same line it was strange to have the decorations inserted between the users characters. So I tweaked this to instead always anchor them at the last character of the line, and stack them up (they appear as `// a // b // c`).\r\n\r\nIt all generally works great, however because they're not actually anchored to the end of the line, but rather the character that happens to be at the end of the line, it's possible for the user to put the cursor behind the last character and type a new character, which appears after the decoration (for a brief period, until it gets updated by my code):\r\n\r\n![Typing behind the labels](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/156888/29633236-7793b0ba-87fa-11e7-9313-8f654fe49c16.gif)\r\n\r\nI don't think I can really fix this, unless Code had support for anchoring a decoration to the end of the line properly (without me just using the last character).\r\n\r\nIs this something you'd consider? I appreciate I might not be using decorations for whatever it was designed for, but this feature has very positive feedback, I'd really like to make it work!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34440","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34440/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34440/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34440/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34440","id":257961305,"number":34440,"title":"Sidebar shows the wrong catalogue","user":{"login":"ChrisShen93","id":11674518,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11674518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisShen93","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisShen93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisShen93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisShen93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisShen93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisShen93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisShen93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisShen93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisShen93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisShen93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisShen93/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":296835379,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/git","name":"git","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-15T08:17:09Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T07:29:12Z","closed_at":"2017-09-18T07:29:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
