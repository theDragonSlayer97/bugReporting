When using JSDoc for type hinting in JavaScript, VSCode doesn't appear to recognize it in the JSDoc.  The last example shows that the JSDoc hinting is working _in general_ by providing a globally scoped/available type in the doc and seeing that VSCode does the right thing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21932","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21932/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21932/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21932/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21932","id":211794614,"number":21932,"title":"When using ctrl+d (addSelectionToNextFindMatch) on a repeated character, it extends selection","user":{"login":"RoscoP","id":5105596,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5105596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoscoP","html_url":"https://github.com/RoscoP","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoscoP/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoscoP/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoscoP/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoscoP/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoscoP/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoscoP/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoscoP/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoscoP/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoscoP/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":423730475,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-multicursor","name":"editor-multicursor","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-03T20:31:39Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T11:17:10Z","closed_at":"2017-03-06T11:17:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.10.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 7 (patched up)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
