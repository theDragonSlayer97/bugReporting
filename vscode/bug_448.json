As the user scrolls down the list, I would like to show a preview-html of the package's README in a virtual document (see screenshot). The existing `InputOptions` do not help me in accomplishing this. For now, I'm using `showQuickPick` but I don't think it exposes a callback for the event of user moving down the list.\r\n\r\nThis experience would be similar to how vscode accomplishes previewing a color theme when the user is browsing through the different available themes from the command palette.

if you are working with EJS as your server side template engine for node.js, these html files have an .ejs extension. As a result, VS Code doesn't recognize by default that this is an html file and then you don't get intellisense when writing html tags. \r\n\r\nVS code has a drop-down at the bottom of the window that allows you to switch between treating the file as \"Plain Text\" to \"HTML\" - however, I didn't notice this drop-down right away. Ideally, for a Node.js dev, it would be nice to auto-detect some of these common extensions so that we treat them as HTML by default - .ejs is just one common extension.  There are others that we should treat the same way, such as .pug.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22332","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22332/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22332/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22332/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22332","id":213174761,"number":22332,"title":"Expose list of valid language ids to extensions","user":{"login":"hoovercj","id":2957173,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2957173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoovercj","html_url":"https://github.com/hoovercj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoovercj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoovercj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoovercj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoovercj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoovercj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoovercj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoovercj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoovercj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoovercj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":290465400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/api","name":"api","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-03-09T21:43:38Z","updated_at":"2017-03-10T08:02:58Z","closed_at":"2017-03-10T07:59:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I apoligize if I've overlooked this, but it would be great if there was an api call that could return a list of valid language ids.\r\n\r\nUse case: I just released an extension that allows users to configure commands that open new files with the language mode set.
