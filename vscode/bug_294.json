where the editor appears to have multiple selections, even though some of them are not visible on the screen. When I start typing with the intent of replacing the visible selection, I end up corrupting the other instance of the same text elsewhere in the file, often times without realizing it until much later. This has been a problem since the early days of VSCode, but I've never been able to figure out repro steps before.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Find a piece of text in your code file that occurs more than once (e.g. a method name).\r\n2. Double-click on the text to select it. Press command-E to set it as the search text.\r\n3. Click somewhere else\r\n4. Repeat step 2. Double-click on the same piece of text as before, press command-E again.\r\n5. At this point, you'll be able to observe two separate blinking insertion points as shown in the attached screen shot.\r\n6. Start typing to replace the selection. Note that the replacement text affects both instances.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-05-19 at 9 06 36 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7040122/26272820/15dcb3a8-3cd7-11e7-9bf3-3c8a29d0ee3e.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26977","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26977/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26977/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26977/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26977","id":230128354,"number":26977,"title":"Select previous file by default when using Ctrl-P","user":{"login":"searene","id":3351317,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3351317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/searene","html_url":"https://github.com/searene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/searene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/searene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/searene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/searene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/searene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/searene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/searene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/searene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/searene/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":527005453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/quick-pick","name":"quick-pick","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-05-20T04:03:40Z","updated_at":"2017-09-06T03:55:28Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

Create two files `foo.js` and `bar.js`\r\n2. Jump to `foo.js` by pressing Ctrl-P and typing `foo.js`\r\n3. Jump to `bar.js` by pressing Ctrl-P and typing `bar.js`. \r\n4. In this step I would like to go back to the previous file `foo.js`. Notice that I'm in `bar.js`. So if I press Ctrl-P right now, the first item in the file list is `bar.js`, which is the current file. I have to type a character `f` to change the first item to `foo.js` so I can jump to it. This behavior is different from Intellij, where the first item would be the previous file instead of the current one(i.e. it will show `foo.js` as the first choice in the file list when you are in `bar.js`), and I think Intellij's strategy is more convenient to me. After all, there is no use to show the current file as the first item of the file list seeing that I'm already in the file, and we may need to jump to the previous file constantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26977/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26976","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26976/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26976/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26976/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26976","id":230127095,"number":26976,"title":"The Bad display of the terminal","user":{"login":"sigmarising","id":25470568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25470568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmarising","html_url":"https://github.com/sigmarising","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmarising/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmarising/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmarising/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmarising/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmarising/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmarising/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmarising/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmarising/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmarising/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-05-20T03:31:33Z","updated_at":"2017-05-21T21:42:06Z","closed_at":"2017-05-21T21:42:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.12.2 (19222cdc84ce72202478ba1cec5cb557b71163de, 2017-05-10T13:20:36.315Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.15063\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|html-snippets|abusaidm|0.1.0|\r\n|code-gnu-global|austin|0.2.2|\r\n|vscode-markdownlint|DavidAnson|0.7.2|\r\n|python|donjayamanne|0.6.4|\r\n|matlab|Gimly81|0.5.0|\r\n|MagicPython|magicstack|1.0.10|\r\n|vscode-autoprefixer|mrmlnc|2.0.0|\r\n|cpptools|ms-vscode|0.11.1|\r\n|vscode-icons|robertohuertasm|7.7.0|\r\n|python|tht13|0.2.3|\r\n|markdown-pdf|yzane|0.1.7|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

So anytime you want to move a background tab over, you have to switch to it, hot-key it over to the side then find your original file back on the left side again, (or find it in the file-tree and right click it there, which in big projects can be tough). \r\n\r\nI already made a small patch that implements the feature.
