VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.12.0-insider (0bec115779b11a9d78bdb24ad7918c22524ea2ac, 2017-04-28T18:57:52.518Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.16184\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn the docs [registerCommand](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api#commands.registerCommand) has callback args of `args: any[]`, while [registerTextEditorCommand](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api#commands.registerTextEditorCommand) as args of `(textEditor: TextEditor, edit: TextEditorEdit, args: any[]`\r\n\r\nThese, of course, are accurate, but don't mention that when a command is called from different contexts some extra arguments may be included at the start of the args array. OK, that isn't entirely true, it is mentioned [in the note here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points#_contributesmenus) but it also isn't 100% accurate -- as the inference can also happen from the command palette as well as possibly other cases. \r\n\r\nAnyway, so say a command is triggered from file explorer item context menu, or an editor context menu -- that the first argument in the `args: any[]` is going to be a [`Uri`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api#Uri), and now with the new [SCM menus](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/api-scm#_menus) the command callback args can contain an arbitrary number of items (the SCM resources selected). And compound that with command execution via [`executeCommand`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api#commands.executeCommand) as well as keybindings supporting argument passing --  its getting hard to deal with the differing args.\r\n\r\nSure, different commands can be registered for different contexts, but that doesn't _feel_ right, especially with shortcut keys, command palette entries, etc (yes, these can be dealt with in most cases with `when` clauses, but that feels like extra and unneeded complexity -- at least imo).\r\n\r\nHonestly I'm not really sure how to solve this, and maybe the recommended solution is to use different commands for different contexts, but maybe there is another way?\r\n\r\nOne thought is to somehow separate \"system-supplied\" arguments, vs \"user-supplied\", or have some sort of \"context\" parameter (at a known and stable position) so that the type of arguments could be inferred. Or maybe a combination of both, something like:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndeclare type CommandSource = 'executeCommand' | 'commandPalette' | 'explorer/context' | 'editor/context' | 'editor/title'; //  ... you get the picture\r\n\r\ncallback: (source: CommandSource, sourceArgs: any[], args: any[]) => any\r\n\r\n// OR -- better yet imo\r\n\r\ninterface EditorCommandContext {\r\n    textEditor: TextEditor;\r\n    edit: TextEditorEdit;\r\n    uri?: Uri;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface ExplorerCommandContext {\r\n    uri?: Uri;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface ScmCommandContext {\r\n    // ??? - Haven't dug into the specifics of this one yet\r\n}\r\n\r\ncallback: (source: CommandSource, context: {} | EditorCommandContext | ExplorerCommandContext | ScmCommandContext, args: any[]) => any)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith something like the last option, it is very extensible (its easy to add another property to the context without breaking any existing code) and its also easier to document and consume. It would also have the added benefit of providing an extension with insight to in what context a command was executed.\r\n\r\nOf course changing the existing callbacks would be a major breaking change, but this could be a new command registration api (with the maybe eventual deprecation of the existing command registration?).\r\n\r\nTo give a concrete example of the issues outlined above -- I'm currently working on refactoring the commands in [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens), so that I can add context menu support to SCM items. But this has been proving more complex than I had first anticipated because of the argument structure of the SCM menus, as well as not being able to tell one context from another. So I've been toying with a few different solutions -- from attempting argument inference in a command base class, that would reorganize the arguments into a more structured layout -- to multiple commands registered for different contexts, and then boiling them together in a sort of \"meta\" command that would provide something like the callback outlined above.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I feel like the current command callback structure is only going to get harder to deal with as the product evolves and more contexts are added -- so I'm very curious for feedback, alternative solutions, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n//cc @jrieken ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25715","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25715/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25715/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25715/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25715","id":225383097,"number":25715,"title":"Assign \"hover over tool-tip\" to a  keyboard combination","user":{"login":"mikeatgithub","id":1069888,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1069888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeatgithub","html_url":"https://github.com/mikeatgithub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeatgithub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeatgithub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeatgithub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeatgithub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeatgithub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeatgithub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeatgithub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeatgithub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeatgithub/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":427411234,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/extension-candidate","name":"extension-candidate","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-01T04:25:35Z","updated_at":"2017-09-05T23:18:26Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.11.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 1703\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Set InputBoxOptions like so:\r\n```typescript\r\n        const powerShellDbgScriptArgsKey = 'powerShellDebugScriptArgs';\r\n\r\n        let options: vscode.InputBoxOptions = {\r\n            ignoreFocusOut: true,\r\n            placeHolder: \"Enter script arguments or leave empty to pass no args\",\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        let prevArgs = this.context.globalState.get(powerShellDbgScriptArgsKey, '');\r\n        if (prevArgs.length > 0) {\r\n            options.value = prevArgs;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return vscode.window.showInputBox(options).then(text => {\r\n            if (text !== undefined) {\r\n                this.context.globalState.update(powerShellDbgScriptArgsKey, text);\r\n                return new Array(text);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            return text;\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n2. When you run this, the user should be able to press Enter on an empty input box to tell us to send no args to the script. However, since we prepopulate the input box with the previous set of arguments, they clear the input box and press Enter.  Unfortunately, that passes the previous arguments as the text instead of the empty string that was in the inputbox before they pressed Enter.\r\n\r\nIs there a workaround I can use to get the InputBox to return an empty string when there is an initial (default) value set and the user clears that value and presses Enter?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25711","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25711/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25711/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25711/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25711","id":225363561,"number":25711,"title":"Would love to be able to fast-project-switch","user":{"login":"atrauzzi","id":115199,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/115199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atrauzzi","html_url":"https://github.com/atrauzzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atrauzzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atrauzzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atrauzzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atrauzzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atrauzzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atrauzzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atrauzzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atrauzzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atrauzzi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2017-04-30T23:47:46Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T06:01:32Z","closed_at":"2017-05-01T09:33:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"gitkraken has a neat dropdown in the top left of their interface.
