VSCode Version: 1.12.1\r\n- OS Version: Travis Mac OS\r\n\r\nI wanted to setup tests on Travis CI for a language server I've been working on. My Travis script downloads the language server executable and then I try the following:\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\nsuite(\"Extension Tests\", () => {\r\n    test(\"GoToDefinition\", async () => {\r\n        let serverOptions : languageclient.ServerOptions = {\r\n            run:   {command: 'lwserver', transport: languageclient.TransportKind.stdio},\r\n            debug: {command: 'lwserver', transport: languageclient.TransportKind.stdio}\r\n        };\r\n        let clientOptions : languageclient.LanguageClientOptions = {\r\n            documentSelector: ['ludwig']\r\n        };\r\n        let ludwig = new languageclient.LanguageClient(\r\n            'Ludwig Language Service', serverOptions, clientOptions\r\n        );\r\n        ludwig.start();\r\n\r\n        await ludwig.onReady();\r\n        assert(!ludwig.needsStart());\r\n\r\n        let testPath = path.join(process.env['PWD'], 'test', 'lw');\r\n        let uri = vscode.Uri.file(path.join(testPath, 'GoTo.lw'));\r\n\r\n        let textDocument = await vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(uri);\r\n\r\n        let ident = converter.asTextDocumentIdentifier(textDocument);\r\n        let tdi : TextDocumentIdentifier = {\r\n            uri: ident.uri\r\n        };\r\n        let textDocumentItem : TextDocumentItem = {\r\n            uri: ident.uri,\r\n            languageId: 'ludwig',\r\n            version: 0,\r\n            text: textDocument.getText()\r\n        };\r\n        let didOpen : protocol.DidOpenTextDocumentParams = {\r\n            textDocument: textDocumentItem\r\n        };\r\n        // tell lwserver that the document has been opened which triggers compilation\r\n        ludwig.sendNotification(protocol.DidOpenTextDocumentNotification.type, didOpen);\r\n        // and we need to wait until it is compiled\r\n        await (telemetryEvent(ludwig, ident.uri));\r\n\r\n        // triple of (word under cursor, cursor position, expected result range)\r\n        let gotoTests =\r\n            [[\"value\",[3,4],[0,4,0,9]]\r\n            ,[\"value\",[6,8],[0,4,0,9]]\r\n            ,[\"value\",[9,8],[0,4,0,9]]\r\n            ,[\"SomeType\",[17,4],[12,6,12,13]]\r\n            ,[\"SomeTypeConstructor2\",[21,29],[13,6,13,29]]\r\n            ,[\"SomeTypeConstructor2\",[20,09],[13,6,13,29]]\r\n            ,[\"SomeTypeConstructor2\",[20,10],[13,6,13,29]]\r\n            ,[\"SomeTypeConstructor2\",[20,28],[13,6,13,29]]\r\n            ,[\"someNumber\",[28,23],[24,14,24,24]]\r\n            ];\r\n\r\n        for(let i=0; i<gotoTests.length; i++) {\r\n            let test = makeGotoTestCase(gotoTests[i]);\r\n\r\n            let range = textDocument.getWordRangeAtPosition(test.position);\r\n            let chunk = textDocument.getText(range);\r\n            assert.equal(test.word, chunk);\r\n\r\n            let posParams = converter.asTextDocumentPositionParams(textDocument, test.position);\r\n            let location = await ludwig.sendRequest(\r\n                    protocol.DefinitionRequest.type,\r\n                    posParams\r\n            );\r\n            assert.deepEqual(\r\n                location[0].range, // actual\r\n                test.expectedRange // expected\r\n            );\r\n        }\r\n    }).timeout(30000);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt works fine when I run it locally on my computer (`npm test` or from VSC) but fails on Travis. The error is:\r\n```\r\n  1) Extension Tests GoToDefinition:\r\n     Error: Timeout of 30000ms exceeded. For async tests and hooks, ensure \"done()\" is called; if returning a Promise, ensure it resolves.\r\n```\r\nIt doesn't matter what timeout I set, it is always exceeded.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to debug this. Any help would be appreciated!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26426","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26426/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26426/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26426/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/26426","id":227874025,"number":26426,"title":"Preserve Webview Scroll Position","user":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2017-05-11T04:15:43Z","updated_at":"2017-05-17T21:17:32Z","closed_at":"2017-05-17T21:17:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/pulls/26426","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/26426","diff_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/26426.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/26426.patch"},"body":"Fixes #22995\r\n\r\n**Bug**\r\nIf you switch away from an editor that users a webview, the scroll position is currently not preserved.
