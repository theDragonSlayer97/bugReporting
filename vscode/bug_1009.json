When I pulled master and could not use it, because in first time there were some issues with runtime (which could be found with integration test) and second time a build issue.\n- It is just my assumption that because of this workflow you can lose interest of some contributors, don't think that most folks will deal with it.\n\nMy suggestion:\n- Personally I believe all changes needs to be made with Code Reviews. But my ask to at least work through PR and only merge when build is green.\n\nMicrosoft now has plenty Open Source projects, I believe most of them (if not all) are using Pull Request model with Code Reviews. Please talk to @shanselman, ASP.NET team or dotnet core team to learn from their experience.\n\n/cc

Reproduce:\n1. Leave VS Code running overnight with laptop lid shut\n2. When I return the next morning, it's unresponsive and eventually prompts me to close it\n\nIt's not the only program that has this issue when I come back in the mornings (Toggl and Slack sometimes do too, but that requires a kill -9 to fix!). Other apps, such as Thunderbird and Firefox, do not have this problem.\n\nI've also noticed that over time the editor gets slower and slower, eventually grinding to a halt. Perhaps this is just the manifestation of that overnight? Perhaps some kind of leak, be it tasks or memory?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5491/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5490","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5490/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5490/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5490/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5490","id":149383607,"number":5490,"title":"How
