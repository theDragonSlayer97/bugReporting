Specifically:\n\nOriginal:\n\n```\n{ \"key\": \"tab\",                   \"command\": \"editor.emmet.action.expandAbbreviation\",\n                                     \"when\": \"editorTextFocus && !editorHasSelection && !editorHasMultipleSelections && !editorTabMovesFocus\" }\n```\n\nThere is no way to remove _only_ above tab command. I tried to do it like the FAQ says, and added this:\n\n```\n    // Remove emmet from tab key\n    { \"key\": \"tab\",             \"when\": \"editorTextFocus && !editorHasSelection && !editorHasMultipleSelections && !editorTabMovesFocus\" },\n\n```\n\nBut it removes _all_ tab commands, including normal tab.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/611","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/611/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/611/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/611/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/611","id":118779679,"number":611,"title":"golang: incorrect syntax error for legal code: type Var string","user":{"login":"mdcnz","id":7417872,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7417872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdcnz","html_url":"https://github.com/mdcnz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdcnz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdcnz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdcnz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdcnz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdcnz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdcnz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdcnz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdcnz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdcnz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-11-25T07:40:01Z","updated_at":"2015-11-25T07:48:57Z","closed_at":"2015-11-25T07:48:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The go code\n\ntype Var string\n\nis legal, but underlined in red with syntax error: unexpected type.

`onDidChangeTextDocument` is that it fires on every key stroke what is often not necessary (or not possible for more expensive / longer operations).\n\nImplementing it is easy (just a timeout

@thoughtentity on October 27, 2015 4:59_\n\nAs part of the extension I'm developing, I'm developing a TypeScript definition file to light up the editor with intellisense for the JavaScript APIs my users will be using when working with my extension in their project. Currently, to support this I need to explicitly inject the type definition files into a user's project through an init command provided by the extension. I'd be nice if VS Code supported this scenario better by implicitly loading definition files from an extension's typings directory. Users can override the extension provided definitions by providing their own type definition files that redefine the typings the extension provided.\n\n_Copied from original issue: Microsoft/vscode-extensionbuilders#64_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/588","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/588/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/588/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/588/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/588","id":118700289,"number":588,"title":"Count of currently visible lines in current Editor","user":{"login":"seanmcbreen","id":1051190,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1051190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmcbreen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":290465400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/api","name":"api","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":10,"created_at":"2015-11-24T20:51:40Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T09:22:12Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"_From @jsturtevant on October 26, 2015 23:25_\n\nIs there an API or way to detect which lines are visible in the current editor?\n\nIn a large file if i use \n\n``` typescript\nlet count = doc.getLineCount();\n```\n\nI get all the count of all the lines in the document but I my case I need to restrict my search to only the current visible lines.
