Instead we should show warning (later \"error\") squigglies in the json editor and offer intellisense to help the user inserting the missing \"${workspaceRoot}\" and have a \"light bulb\" action for fixing the whole launch json (as an example use the validation that got introduced for the Keyboard Shortcuts json).\n\nIf this is not possible for January, I suggest that we only fix our intellisense, templates, samples, etc. but show no warnings in the launch.json editor.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1574","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1574/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1574/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1574/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1574","id":123468428,"number":1574,"title":"Task and/or Extension Command User Arguments On Entry","user":{"login":"edencorbin","id":1577795,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1577795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edencorbin","html_url":"https://github.com/edencorbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edencorbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edencorbin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edencorbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edencorbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edencorbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edencorbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edencorbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edencorbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edencorbin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":290465400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/api","name":"api","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-12-22T11:58:04Z","updated_at":"2016-01-15T11:01:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I am creating an extension and I want the end user to be able to enter an argument (say string) at the step they select \"Run Task\".

c34d2e771bb3e372e912e081a8bd8879a92a8c91 adds this functionality but restricting it to Windows. I created a new issue #1563 for having the same toggle available also when running on Linux. This pull request should fix the issue on at least some Linux window managers.\n\nThe changes done in the earlier commit worked perfectly on Linux Mint 17.2 which is running a GTK+ 3 toolkit based Cinnamon window manager. I would expect the changes to work at least on other GTK based window managers.\n\n@bpasero noted that it didn't work on Ubuntu 15 which at least by default uses the Unity window manager. Unity has its own unique way of handling the menu bar. Ubuntu introduced an OS X style shared menu bar few versions back, and now Ubuntu 15 seems to refine the concept with a new \"locally integrated menu\". It would not be surprising if it caused incompatibility with more conventional approaches.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1563","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1563/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1563/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1563/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1563","id":123413670,"number":1563,"title":"Add

completing CSS values, there is a very long list of named colours, keywords, functions, etc. Included are a whole host of CSS System Colours, which have been deprecated for a long time. \n\n“Earlier versions of CSS defined several additional named color keywords, the <deprecated-system-color>s, which were meant to take their value from operating system themes. These color names have been deprecated, however, as they are insufficient for their original purpose (making website elements look like their native OS counterparts), and represent a security risk, as it makes it easier for a webpage to \"spoof\" a native OS dialog.” – https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#system-colors\n\nWhile it is easy to skim read through the named colours, these system colours hide some of the more valuable values, such as transparent and currentColor. \n\nAs the system colours are deprecated, arguably of little value, and probably not used very much, should we remove them from the completion list?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1559","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1559/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1559/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1559/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1559","id":123383726,"number":1559,"title":"[jade]

I get a tooltip over \"ctrl+alt+-\" telling me to press \"ctrl+alt+ß\" instead (the ß key of the German keyboard is at the position of the - key on the English keyboard)\n\nHowever, the command I actually have to press in order to navigate backwards is ctrl+alt+-, using the - key of the German keyboard, which is somewhere else entirely.\n\nThus, the tooltip is incorrect while the key as it is stated in the config file is correct.\n\nEdit: my operating system is Linux x64 (Ubuntu 14.04)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4860","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507415105","x-github-request-id":"D01A:366F:CE94AA:193D841:59D948BF","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1141>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1139>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d943eb0065889115d2f0e4e6fead8670\"","status":"200 OK"}}
