This bug unfortunately makes VSC for me unusable, as it highly frustrates me having to restart my editor every 5 minutes, lose last position, recent changes in file etc. Might I help by providing some kind of log? Pleas give me instructions to help you if possible.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open CSS file of approc 100 kb in VSC\n2. Keep working for about 5 minutes. Then VSC totally freezes. Cursor stops at position, window does not respond to any kind of input.\n\nYes, VSC after another 2 minutes show dialog \"Keep waiting/reopen.\" However no matter which option I select, the apps keep being frozen. \"Reopen button\" only hides the dialog but does not restart the app. Has to be done throught Windows Task manager.\n\nNote: the menu bar is responding when application is frozen.

It allows to render complex objects in form of tables. It would be great to have something similar in vs code. Yes, I can put breakpoint and manually dump object. But I want to be able to do that from code. So I can re-run program and instantly see complex object in debugger log. Don't really care what would be the method to dump objects.

How can I make it? I found no good documentations or sample codes for that. \n\nAlso another question is that how can I open this \"custom-view\" for a certain format instead of the monaco?\n\nThanks for all you kind answers as always.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11851","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11851/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11851/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11851/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11851","id":176260730,"number":11851,"title":"Embedded
