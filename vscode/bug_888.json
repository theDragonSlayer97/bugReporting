referencing the file with `markdown.styles` settings. This work but it's not easy/intuitive and it does not actually remove the `tomorrow` rules/stylesheet from the document (which can provide some unwanted defaults).\n\nI suggest that you make the

(Some differences, like `contentText`, are obvious and do not need an explanation.)\n1. `DecorationRenderOptions` allows setting all of the various border styles independently, while `ThemableDecorationAttachmentRenderOptions` provides only a `border` property, which does not allow different styles for top, left, right, and bottom.\n2.

on a Java language server...\n\n`WorkspaceSymbolProvider.provideWorkspaceSymbols` returns a set of `SymbolInformation` where each SymbolInformation contains a location, including the source range of the element.\n\nThe problem is that acquiring the source range of an element is quite expensive in our case, as it requires opening the document that contains the symbol. (The symbol index we have does not contain source ranges).\nAs the open symbol action doesn't really need the range until the user selects a symbol to be opened, it would be good if the API would have an additional hook that allows to resolve a SymbolInformation element, similar to what is there for
