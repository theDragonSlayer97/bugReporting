require a page reaload to hit the breakpoint)\r\n3.

I had no insider build installed at all until I downloaded it to see if it would work, but it has the same symptoms.\r\n\r\nOpening the editor from the dock, finder, or via `open` from a terminal with clean environment (`/bin/sh`) results in this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/73085/24836277/cbe213cc-1d52-11e7-9bf0-819ae8ff8dc5.png)\r\n\r\nAlmost nothing functions at all; the window can be resized, but not dragged; it can be closed, but not with keyboard shortcuts. The menu options seem to mostly work, or at least the ones that don't do things directly to the window contents. The inspector from the Toggle Developer Tools in the Help menu also works, though not any of the keyboard shortcuts. Can't use Cmd+A to select text, for example.\r\n\r\nHowever, the interesting part is that opening it with the `code` command line does work, at least some of the time. Sometimes, it will work, but the keyboard will be completely non-functional, and the shortcuts that do work are incorrect for my keyboard layout (but valid qwerty). Opening it from my fully functional shell (with all profile scripts) by invoking the `Contents/MacOS/Electron` binary also works; it doesn't on the bare shell mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\nDuring the update from 1.10 to 1.11, I clicked on the editor icon only about 3 seconds or so after it closed, so I wonder if that could cause some kind of corruption. However, removing and re-downloading the editor, or even deleting everything under `~/Library/Application Support/Code` does not help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24359","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24359/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24359/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24359/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24359","id":220458504,"number":24359,"title":"Allow any tab to be moved across instances","user":{"login":"joaompinto","id":1143125,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1143125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaompinto","html_url":"https://github.com/joaompinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaompinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaompinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaompinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaompinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaompinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaompinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaompinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaompinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaompinto/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":365206665,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench-tabs","name":"workbench-tabs","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-04-09T09:06:35Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T04:53:45Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
