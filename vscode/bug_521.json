VSCode Version: 1.9.0\r\n- OS Version: OSX 10.12.3\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. I cannot currently reliably reproduce this bug in any clean environment. \r\n\r\nI am experiencing a bug concerning VSCode's tree view. Video of the bug is captured in [this Giphy link](http://www.giphy.com/gifs/26gss0EPsl58Yhj32). \r\n\r\nIn this video, I am simply clicking (to expand and contract) whichever folder is highlighted. You can see that the children of `templates` changes each time I expand and contract it. \r\n\r\n```\r\nFolderA\r\n|-> FolderB\r\n    |-> Content\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I have `FolderA` and `FolderB` expanded, then collapse `FolderA`, the next time I expand `FolderA` it displays some items from `Content` as `FolderA`'s child instead of an expanded `FolderB` with all of `Content` underneath it. \r\n\r\nThis is a rough description of what I am observing, but the behavior is inconsistent. As shown in the video, often it will choose different things from `Content` to render. I cannot reproduce the bug in a clean workspace. Quitting VSCode and restarting it tends to fix the issue, but it will begin to do it again after a couple hours of being open. When it happens, this behavior is not observed across all folders. There is nothing especially strange about the folders it happens in; they contain no more than a dozen direct children, they do not tend to be folders whose direct children have recently been edited, and the workspace itself has around 1000 files total. \r\n\r\nI first noticed this bug after the update to 1.9.0. \r\n\r\nI will attempt to capture more footage of it happening when it starts doing it again. Let me know if I can be of any other assistance!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20142/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20141","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20141/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20141/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20141/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20141","id":205968365,"number":20141,"title":"Default
