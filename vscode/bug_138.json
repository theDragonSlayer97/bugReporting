I would love to have 1 or 2 additional locations -- something like `SideBar` where it would show the \"progress bar\" on any activity currently active in the the side bar, and/or `Editor` (would call it `Window` but that is used) where it would show the similar \"progress bar\" but instead of in the side bar, it would be on the active editor.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I also found it confusing that when using `SourceControl` no progress message or anything needs to be set, but to use `Window` you must set at least 1 progress message otherwise no indicator shows.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes/No","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31663","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31663/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31663/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31663/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31663","id":246340680,"number":31663,"title":"How to change the color of reference of Macro in .c file?","user":{"login":"yxhq","id":10378954,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10378954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhq","html_url":"https://github.com/yxhq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-28T13:00:28Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T07:18:56Z","closed_at":"2017-08-03T07:18:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
