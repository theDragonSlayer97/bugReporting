have patiently tried to use Babel to produce JavaScript source maps that works with VSCode. \n\nThe latest published version of `gulp-sourcemaps` (1.6.0) doesn't have the ability to produce a correct relateive path from the compiled code to the source file in the `sources` array when your output is in a tree parallel to your source. This made it impossible to use gulp+babel to build maps that worked with VS Code, since it doesn't support inline source code. [So I forked it and fixed it.](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/936)\n\nAll was well for a while, but now I've come back to the project again, and they no longer work. But I have no idea why - there's no diagnostic about why the source map isn't shown. This is probably my own fault, since I had a feature request to [show native code if source map isn't available](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-node-debug/issues/23). Which is great!! Unless you were expecting a source map and didn't get one. Now you just don't see a source map and don't see an error. :(\n\nI have pored over my target files & the `sources` look exactly right. Nothing has changed since I got this working a couple months ago. I've tried messing with `outDir`, I just see nothing wrong. So I am not sure if this is a new bug in vscode, or something I just can't see that I accidentally broke since the last time it worked.\n\nI feel like trying to get nodejs + babel source maps working reliably in VS Code has become a hobby akin to using a metal detector to find gold on a beach. I want it to work so badly, because the debugging experience is so awesome compared to anything else, but I just can't seem to make it work reliably no matter how hard I try.\n\nI think all this would go away if VSCode just supported embedded source code. There's be nothing to get lost, no relative paths to worry about, no concerns about distribution vs. source code heirarchy. It would just work, the way it always does in chrome.\n\nWhat are the chances this can become a reality?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2802","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2802/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2802/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2802/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2802","id":132254203,"number":2802,"title":"Edge

The text editor's `insertSpaces` setting is `true` (or leading spaces precede tab characters on a line).\n2. The cursor is within the range of leading indentation.\n   1. We can't possibly guess where indentation ends and alignment begins, so this includes all leading whitespace (both spaces and tab characters, assuming each tab character is the width of `tabSize`).\n3. The user attempts to do any of the following:\n   1. Arrow-key navigation.\n   2. Backspace.\n   3. Delete.\n   4. Mouse selections (more difficult to implement, I'm sure).\n## Examples of how spaces are treated as tabs\n1. If the cursor is at the beginning of the line and the right arrow key is pressed, the cursor jumps `tabSize` spaces, instead of just one.\n2. If `tabSize` is `4` and the cursor is on position `6` (between tabs) and the left arrow key is pressed, the cursor jumps `2` spaces instead of `4`, landing gracefully on a tab stop.\n3. If `tabSize` is `4` and the cursor is on position `4`, but the first non-whitespace character is on position `6`, then the space on position `5` is assumed to be alignment; thus, a right arrow key press would land on position `5`.\n4. The backspace and delete keys should eliminate up to `tabSize` spaces in one batch, so that a single undo operation restores all of the spaces that were deleted.\n5. Ideally, mouse selections would also be restricted to tab stops, so you can't individually select the spaces between a single indent.\n## Exposing an editor setting\n- Perhaps an editor setting called `navigateSoftTabsAsHard` should be exposed for those who wish to opt in or out of this feature. The default value is debatable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2798/reactions","total_count":16,"+1":16,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2797","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2797/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2797/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2797/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2797","id":132233091,"number":2797,"title":"Changing
