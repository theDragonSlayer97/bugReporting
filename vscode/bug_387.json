version 1.11.1 (last I used was 1.10.2), the shortcut to \"Toggle Line Comment\" (which was `Ctrl+/`) now zooms out, like when pressing (`Ctrl+-`). Pressing `Ctrl+Shift+7` does work, but `Shift+7` is `&`. The actual layout when writing text, is correctly set to US, but shortcuts are interpreted as DE.  \r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.11.1\r\n- OS Version: Arch Linux 64-bit (using the .tar.gz version)\r\n- Desktop environment: KDE Plasma 5.9\r\n- Current keyboard layout: EN-US\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Keyboard Shortcuts.\r\n2. Find the shortcut and edit it.\r\n\r\nInside [`Developer: Inspect Key Mappings`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Keybindings#troubleshooting-2-command---what-key-to-press) there is no `VK_OEM_2`.\r\n\r\nSome interesting values:\r\n```\r\nLayout info:\r\n{\r\n\t\"model\": \"pc104\",\r\n\t\"layout\": \"de,us\",\r\n\t\"variant\": \"\",\r\n\t\"options\": \"grp:win_space_toggle,kpdl:dotoss,altwin:meta_alt,caps:ctrl_modifier\",\r\n\t\"rules\": \"evdev\"\r\n}\r\nisUSStandard: false\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\t\"Minus\": {\r\n\t\t\"value\": \"ß\",\r\n\t\t\"withShift\": \"?\",\r\n\t\t\"withAltGr\": \"\\\\\",\r\n\t\t\"withShiftAltGr\": \"¿\"\r\n\t},\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\t\"Slash\": {\r\n\t\t\"value\": \"-\",\r\n\t\t\"withShift\": \"_\",\r\n\t\t\"withAltGr\": \"–\",\r\n\t\t\"withShiftAltGr\": \"—\"\r\n\t},\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be that when there are multiple layouts configured, VS Code sets as key layout the first value for `layout` form `setxkbmap -query`, ignoring the current layout. If I switch to be `en,de` then VS Code uses the EN layout, as it is the first in the list. It would be handy if VS Code could use the current layout instead of the first from the list.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24166/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24165","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24165/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24165/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24165/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24165","id":220092450,"number":24165,"title":"use Emmet syntax insert html element will create a odd cursor look at attachment^.^","user":{"login":"bestvow","id":24888709,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/24888709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bestvow","html_url":"https://github.com/bestvow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bestvow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bestvow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bestvow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bestvow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bestvow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bestvow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bestvow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bestvow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bestvow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"ramya-rao-a","id":16890566,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16890566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a","html_url":"https://github.com/ramya-rao-a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ramya-rao-a","id":16890566,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16890566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a","html_url":"https://github.com/ramya-rao-a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-04-07T02:43:55Z","updated_at":"2017-04-07T19:48:22Z","closed_at":"2017-04-07T09:22:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.11.1 (d9484d12b38879b7f4cdd1150efeb2fd2c1fbf39, 2017-04-06T13:58:12.954Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\r\n\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|html-snippets|abusaidm|0.1.0|\r\n|path-intellisense|christian-kohler|1.2.0|\r\n|auto-rename-tag|formulahendry|0.0.11|\r\n|HTMLHint|mkaufman|0.3.3|\r\n|Theme-TomorrowKit|ms-vscode|0.1.4|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n![cursor](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24888709/24783495/48a502e6-1b7f-11e7-8062-6a562054ec4b.gif)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4975","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"910A:3670:A5A921:1AB2323:59D9384F","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=388>;
