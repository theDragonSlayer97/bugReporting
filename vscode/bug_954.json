trees typically behave like this:\n- clicking with the mouse keeps focus in the tree (see below for explanation)\n- double click moves focus to the editor\n- Cmd/Ctrl+click opens the editor to the side\n\nYou can see this in action e.g. in search: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/search/browser/searchViewlet.ts#L892\n\nWhen I use the mouse to click on an entry in the problems list, I would expect focus to remain in the list. It seems you open an editor without specifying the `preserveFocus` option which would keep the focus in the tree.\n\nOf course only use that option when the mouse is used, not on enter.

Install VSCode behind a firewall configured via a pac file\n2. Try to install a C# extension\n3. Fail\n4. Uninstall and use something else\n\nThe system admin has disabled the settings in IE via Group Policy so I can't work out what the pac is and as such can't work out the proxy to put in the config.\n\nVSCode should just use the system proxy settings by default and ask for a username/password if necessary.\nThere should still be manual options for proxies in the config, however, it would also be useful for someone to have the option to specify a pac file too if for some reason the auto detection doesn't
