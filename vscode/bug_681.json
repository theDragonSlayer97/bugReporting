From the release notes I think this should work (though I may have misunderstood):\r\n\r\n> There is now `WorkspaceConfiguration#update` which allows extensions to add/update/remove configuration options. This should ease configuring the editor and extensions. For example, an extension would be able to configure a linter from a warning via a code action.\r\n\r\n Code looks like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nlet config = vs.workspace.getConfiguration(\"dart\");\r\n\r\n// Read current value\r\nconsole.log(config.get(\"debugExternalLibraries\", false));\r\n\r\n// Update to true, globally\r\nconfig.update(\"debugExternalLibraries\", true, true /* false fails too */);\r\n\r\n// Read new value\r\nconsole.log(config.get(\"debugExternalLibraries\"));\r\n\r\n// Try re-fetching config in case stale\r\nlet config2 = vs.workspace.getConfiguration(\"dart\");\r\nconsole.log(config2.get(\"debugExternalLibraries\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput is:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nfalse\r\nfalse\r\nfalse\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe value defaults to `false` in my `package.json` and is not set at the user or workspace level (I have no `settings.json` at the workspace level). After I set it to true (I've tried both globally and locally) it still always returns true. The user `settings.json` isn't updated when I do globally, and it is not created (I don't have one) in the project when I try at the workspace level.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15349","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15349/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15349/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15349/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15349","id":188743936,"number":15349,"title":"
