came up in a discussion with the C++ extension team. They are going to move their setup and configuration steps out of our docs to their extension README. They were concerned that the README would be long and navigation would be problematic. They can add H2 header links at the top (like we do for our in-product release notes) but would need the same \"return to top\" support as our in-product release notes.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation in the release notes are embedded HTML elements.\r\nIt would be nice to embed these elements in all the Extension details view renderings.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a id=\"scroll-to-top\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"scroll to top\" onclick=\"scroll(0,0); event.preventDefault(); event.stopPropagation()\"><span class=\"icon\"></span></a>\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/inproduct_releasenotes.css\"/>\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20822","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20822/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20822/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20822/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20822","id":208502916,"number":20822,"title":"File | Save As closes editor","user":{"login":"mfrost66","id":3818866,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3818866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66","html_url":"https://github.com/mfrost66","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-17T17:14:49Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T20:54:14Z","closed_at":"2017-02-17T20:54:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.91\r\n- OS Version:Win 10\r\n\r\nSelecting menu:File|Save behaves the same as menu:File|Exit\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
