In launch.json configurations section. Write a compicated argument to pass to the script. For example \"-a filename\". It doesn't work. you should do instead \"-afilename\" and in that way it works\r\n2. Now try a more complicated parameter like: \"--ss rose\". If you try \"--ssrose\" it won't work.\r\n3. Finally in my case, I have an script with an option with multiple values separated by spaces. This is imposible because this space problem. It should be: \"--cc key1=value1 key2=value2\" but to make it works I should change --cc for -x and it's only posible to add a value.
