VSCode Version: 1.13.0\r\n- OS Version: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.15063]\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n1. Here is the starting phase. 1 staged file and 1 unstaged. I will be staging some lines from the unstaged file which is `ai-chart-resize.directive.js`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19337229/27076138-dff3e50e-505e-11e7-9d5b-3f19f914363b.png)\r\n\r\n2. Here I select lines `50 - 67` of `ai-chart-resize.directive.js` and press `Stage Selected Ranges`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19337229/27076176-f7a9c146-505e-11e7-8644-7451ff962c95.png)\r\n\r\n3. `ai-chart-resize.directive.js` has been added to `Staged Changes` as expected`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19337229/27076224-2bb7d220-505f-11e7-8a05-bc0c89aebf70.png)\r\n\r\n4.

Now, the problem starts here. Going back to the `Unstaged Changes` version of the file the lines `50 - 67` which I previously staged is still there.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19337229/27076308-6a689090-505f-11e7-8f64-95aab9825f0d.png)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nBefore, the expected behavior is that the lines staged will no longer appear in the `Unstaged Changes` version of the file since the lines are already staged.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be an issue with features related to `changes`.
