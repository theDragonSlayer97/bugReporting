to get the `window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor` event when there is no active editor -- i.e. closing all documents/tabs, switching to say an extension page (where there is no text editor). The event would just have an `undefined` editor parameter, but now I no longer seems to fire at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open an extension that listens for `window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor`\r\n2. Observe that no event will be raised when you close the last editor, nor when you switch to an extension page\r\n\r\nThis is causing issues in GitLens (https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens/issues/65 is one) since I am not getting the event anymore to properly update my tracking. This has also broken https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-restore-editors for the same reason.\r\n\r\n/cc @jrieken ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24506","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24506/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24506/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24506/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24506","id":220935202,"number":24506,"title":"PHP IntelliSense extension -
