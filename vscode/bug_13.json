VSCode Version: 1.16.1 (1.16.1)\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.12.6\r\n\r\nSome npm modules ship with sourcemaps (.map files or inline sourcemaps) and compiled js.  When source maps are present vscode is quite successful at presenting the sourcemapped codebase when debugging.\r\n\r\nThere are still gaps in the experience though when I want to set a breakpoint somewhere in one of my compiled node_modules/ packages.   I have to navigate to the compiled code, set a breakpoint somewhere in the compiled output, start the debugger, and then I'll end up in the original source through sourcemap translation with a  nice debugger experience ...  It would be amazing if vscode offered a mechanism that allowed directly navigating the sourcemaps of npm modules when available (in some kind of non-editable mode since changes to such a source-mapping presentation would of necessity not behave as expected without integration with the module's build process).  This way I could set breakpoints in a representation of the original source rather than it's compiled output.\r\n\r\nThis feature would also provide better readability ergonomics for browsing the code of my project's npm dependencies.  There's a large speed and convenience difference between peaking at the code on my disk in my editor vs (1) figuring out the version of the project on my disk and then (2) navigating to that version of that project's codebase wherever it happens to live (in practice this experience usually means opening the project on github and having a much worse code navigation experience than exists in vscode).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35438","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35438/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35438/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35438/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35438","id":261866997,"number":35438,"title":"Generators in TypeScript messes up debugging ","user":{"login":"anwar3606","id":3619250,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3619250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anwar3606","html_url":"https://github.com/anwar3606","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anwar3606/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anwar3606/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anwar3606/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anwar3606/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anwar3606/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anwar3606/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anwar3606/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anwar3606/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anwar3606/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-30T19:36:17Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T08:35:27Z","closed_at":"2017-10-02T08:35:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I used generators in my typescript. after that it doesn't stops in the breakpoints I put in the ts file.\r\nInstead I had to put the breakpoints in the js file. \r\n\r\nI think this is caused by the generator function generated by typescript at the top, which messes up the line number of both file.\r\n\r\nIs there something I missing, new to this typescript thing.
