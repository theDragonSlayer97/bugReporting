Stopped state such as callstack and variables can be requested while the process is running.\n\nHere is a log from the C# debugger of the commands (C) received from VS Code and the Response (R) and Events (E) returned by the debug adapter:\n\n```\nC next: {\"threadId\":19448}\n R: {\"success\":true,\"message\":null,\"request_seq\":10,\"command\":\"next\",\"body\":null,\"running\":false,\"refs\":null,\"seq\":17,\"type\":\"response\"}\nE stopped: {\"threadId\":19448,\"reason\":\"step\",\"source\":{\"name\":\"Program.cs\",\"path\":\"c:\\\\Users\\\\chuckr\\\\Source\\\\scratch\\\\Program.cs\",\"sourceReference\":0},\"line\":13,\"column\":17,\"text\":null,\"allThreadsStopped\":true,\"type\":\"stopped\"}\nC stackTrace: {\"threadId\":19448,\"levels\":20}\n R: {\"success\":true,\"message\":null,\"request_seq\":11,\"command\":\"stackTrace\",\"body\":{\"stackFrames\":[{\"id\":1000,\"source\":{\"name\":\"Program.cs\",\"path\":\"c:\\\\Users\\\\chuckr\\\\Source\\\\scratch\\\\Program.cs\",\"sourceReference\":0},\"line\":13,\"column\":17,\"name\":\"ConsoleApplication.Program.Main(string[] args)\"},{\"id\":1001,\"source\":null,\"line\":0,\"column\":0,\"name\":\"[External Code]\"}]},\"running\":false,\"refs\":null,\"seq\":20,\"type\":\"response\"}\nC scopes: {\"frameId\":1000}\n R: {\"success\":true,\"message\":null,\"request_seq\":12,\"command\":\"scopes\",\"body\":{\"scopes\":[{\"name\":\"Locals\",\"variablesReference\":1000,\"expensive\":false}]},\"running\":false,\"refs\":null,\"seq\":21,\"type\":\"response\"}\nC variables: {\"variablesReference\":1000}\n R: {\"success\":true,\"message\":null,\"request_seq\":13,\"command\":\"variables\",\"body\":{\"variables\":[{\"name\":\"args\",\"value\":\"{string[0]} [string[]]\",\"variablesReference\":0}]},\"running\":false,\"refs\":null,\"seq\":22,\"type\":\"response\"}\nC next: {\"threadId\":19448}\nC next: {\"threadId\":19448}\n R: {\"success\":true,\"message\":null,\"request_seq\":15,\"command\":\"next\",\"body\":null,\"running\":false,\"refs\":null,\"seq\":26,\"type\":\"response\"}\nC next: {\"threadId\":19448}\n R: {\"success\":true,\"message\":null,\"request_seq\":16,\"command\":\"next\",\"body\":null,\"running\":false,\"refs\":null,\"seq\":27,\"type\":\"response\"}\nE stopped: {\"threadId\":19448,\"reason\":\"step\",\"source\":{\"name\":\"Program.cs\",\"path\":\"c:\\\\Users\\\\chuckr\\\\Source\\\\scratch\\\\Program.cs\",\"sourceReference\":0},\"line\":15,\"column\":17,\"text\":null,\"allThreadsStopped\":true,\"type\":\"stopped\"}\nC next: {\"threadId\":19448}\n R: {\"success\":true,\"message\":null,\"request_seq\":17,\"command\":\"next\",\"body\":null,\"running\":false,\"refs\":null,\"seq\":30,\"type\":\"response\"}\n1: (11089) <-1028-stack-list-frames 0 1000 --thread 19448\nC next: {\"threadId\":19448}\nE stopped: {\"threadId\":19448,\"reason\":\"step\",\"source\":{\"name\":\"Program.cs\",\"path\":\"c:\\\\Users\\\\chuckr\\\\Source\\\\scratch\\\\Program.cs\",\"sourceReference\":0},\"line\":10,\"column\":13,\"text\":null,\"allThreadsStopped\":true,\"type\":\"stopped\"}\n R: {\"success\":true,\"message\":null,\"request_seq\":18,\"command\":\"next\",\"body\":null,\"running\":false,\"refs\":null,\"seq\":33,\"type\":\"response\"}\nC next: {\"threadId\":19448}\n```\n\nIt can easily be seen from this log that additional step commands are sent before stopped events are received for previous steps. I have also seen cases where things appear to happen in this order:\n1. Step Command\n2. Stopped Event\n3. Step Command\n4. StackTrace Command \n\nHere the StackTrace command in 4 corresponds to the stopped event from 2, but a new step has already been issued and the process is running, meaning a stacktrace cannot be retrieved.\n\nThe UI should prevent sending these step commands until it has received a stopped event rather than relying on each debug adapter to protect themselves from this behavior.
