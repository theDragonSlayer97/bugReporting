loading insecure content by default and allow for finer control over what content is loaded. The new security settings have three levels:\r\n\r\n- Strict — Disables http content, svgs, and other potentially dangerous elements such a scripts\r\n-  Allow insecure content — Allow http content and svgs but keep scripts disabled\r\n- None — Anything goes\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n**Basic**\r\n  1. Create a new workspace and crate a markdown document with the following content:\r\n  \r\n```markdown \r\nHttps cat is very friendly and should always be around:\r\n\r\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Silverton_-_Domestic_Cat.JPG/320px-Silverton_-_Domestic_Cat.JPG)\r\n\r\nHttp cat is a bit more skittish and should only show up when you select `allow insecure content`:\r\n\r\n![](http://www.petdrugsonline.co.uk/images/page-headers/cats-master-header)\r\n\r\nScript kitty should only show up in the background when you disable security:\r\n\r\n<script>\r\ndocument.body.style.background = 'url(http://everywhereagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/keyboard.png)'\r\n</script>\r\n\r\nVector cat should only show up when you allow insecure content:\r\n\r\n ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Cat_silhouette.svg)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Open the markdown preview. \r\n3. Make sure the correct cats are showing. When some content has not been loaded, there should be an alert in the markdown preview. Click on this alert to change security settings for previews in this workspace\r\n\r\n\r\n**Local resources**\r\n1. Also try adding some local images:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n![](local/cat.png)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLocal images should always be loaded\r\n\r\n**Security settings apply per workspace**\r\n1. Now try creating multiple markdown documents and opening previews for them.\r\n2. Make sure the markdown security setting applies to all markdown files in the workspace.\r\n3. Close and reopen vscode and make sure the security setting is persisted\r\n4. Open multiple workspaces. Make sure the settings work as expected in this scenario\r\n\r\n**Run the `Change Markdown preview security settings` command**\r\n1. With only a markdown document open (and no previews) run the `Change Markdown preview security settings` command\r\n2. Make sure this setting correctly applies when you open a preview\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30878","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30878/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30878/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30878/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30878","id":243485173,"number":30878,"title":"Screen doesn't follow cursor beyond screen's edge when using multiple cursors","user":{"login":"01abhishekjain","id":11534188,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11534188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/01abhishekjain","html_url":"https://github.com/01abhishekjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/01abhishekjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/01abhishekjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/01abhishekjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/01abhishekjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/01abhishekjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/01abhishekjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/01abhishekjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/01abhishekjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/01abhishekjain/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":426116471,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-contrib","name":"editor-contrib","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-07-17T18:30:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-01T19:01:29Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.14.1\r\n- OS Version: OSX Sierra 10.12.4\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
