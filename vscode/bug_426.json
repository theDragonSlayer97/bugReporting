Is anyone from MS interested in helping shape the future of the specification?

This is however typescript related, but what can do vscode better?\r\n\r\n**Current very serious problems:**\r\n- I don't know which tsconfig file was used for the workspace - especially if you have nested packages - even if it is always the root one - It must be explicitly showed somewhere\r\n- I learn a lot about type acquisition - but I never know what it acquire. It were very helpful if vscode could provide the list of acquired files. I don't know until now how it exactly, and to be honest I have no clue how I can figure this out. Somewhere I read about the \"global.d.ts\" to include - It never worked - only the node_modules/@types folder was affected.\r\n- When I experiment with the tsconfig I never know what's the typescript server is doing after a change. Sometimes it reloads sometimes not or after an unknown time. Because this is the case, it breaks me my last leg to at least get a clue how my config changes affects\r\n- Show failed lookup path for not found modules - How I said at the beginning it is very difficult to debug the module/type resolution part, the only information I get is \"module not found\" - it were so much better if at least the failedLookup list were showed in the problem entry - it would at least give me a clue if I'm on the right road\r\n\r\nPlease, please improve at least some those things, It's just so much time I waste until now to just get my project work. (I use a complex webpack configuration with ts-code, however I don't mention here any webpack related things, they are general issues)\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Appendix**\r\nThe only help from vscode I currently seen was:\r\n<img width=\"495\" alt=\"bildschirmfoto 2017-03-22 um 10 33 05\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1138623/24191123/0edcee2a-0eeb-11e7-9087-e531da532099.png\">\r\nSometimes. Very rarely. I never know when (after a restart and waiting a minute or so). I got this little error marker there if I add a not existing file property array (not tested with other config props). It hint's that the \"notexists\" file not exists. This is correct, but how I said, I never know when it's appear and when it's appear It's very small to recognise it.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23002","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23002/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23002/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23002/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23002","id":215998671,"number":23002,"title":"INSERT
