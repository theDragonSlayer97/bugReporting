guys, first of all, vscode is a very powerful tool. I use it for my frontend development, Lately I have been facing issues with iIntellisense, i.e. sometimes it doesn't work. When I hover over a variable, it just show loading text. When I cmd + click on a particular function, it doesn't go to the it's definition.\r\nWhenever I encounter it I have to restart the vscode to make it working.\r\n\r\nI don't have steps to reproduce, but I suspect |vscode-eslint|dbaeumer|1.2.8| is impacting the
