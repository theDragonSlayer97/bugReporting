VSCode Version: 1.10.2 (8076a19fdcab7e1fc1707952d652f0bb6c6db331)\r\n- OS Version: macOS Sierra 10.12.3\r\n\r\nVS Code uses 13% CPU when focused and idle, draining battery. This is likely due to the blinking cursor rendering. I think CPU usage when focused-and-idle could ideally be near-0%.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce (this works with an empty settings file and all plugins disabled):\r\n\r\n1. Close all VS Code windows.\r\n2. Open a new window (File -> New Window). It will show the Welcome page.\r\n3. Open a new tab with an empty untitled file (File -> New Tab). The cursor is blinking.\r\n4. You should see VS Code consuming a non-negligible amount of CPU -- 13% on my 13\" MacBook Pro.\r\n5. Cmd+Tab into some other application. Now the cursor isn't visible anymore.\r\n6. You should see VS Code consuming virtually no CPU.\r\n\r\nI recorded a Timeline in the Developer Tools, and a cursory look suggests that the CPU activity comes from rendering the blinking cursor every 500ms.\r\n\r\nOther macOS applications like Chrome or TextEdit show a blinking cursor without consuming much CPU, so I think this could surely be optimized away.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22900/reactions","total_count":1057,"+1":413,"-1":23,"laugh":464,"hooray":55,"confused":55,"heart":47}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22899","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22899/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22899/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22899/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22899","id":215490149,"number":22899,"title":"Cannot

VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 7 Enterprise, SP1 **and** Windows 10 Home\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a large file (for instance a 20k+ lines python file).\r\n2. Press PageDown and watch the delay between each key-press and when the rendering happens. It's hard to measure, but I'd say the delay is at least 100 ms, probably more.\r\n3. Load the same file in Notepad++ and do the same experiment. You'll see that there is no noticeable delay between the key-press and the rendering.\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen on all extensions all the time, it seems fundamental. My colleague has it too, and the commenter on my StackOverflow question as well; I believe everyone has it. It's just that a lot of developers are fine with it.\r\n\r\nI've seen no suggestions to circumvent this delay in the question I posted on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39648612/visual-studio-code-rendering-delay). This is a nuisance and really a showstopper for me - I can't use an editor with too slow rendering - which is a shame as I think Visual Studio Code seems like an otherwise awesome tool.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22875/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22874","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22874/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22874/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22874/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22874","id":215364424,"number":22874,"title":"unable
