all,\r\n\r\nCurrently when I search for a string and there are lots of results in lots of files, files with less than 10 results are automatically expanded. There is also a button \"Collapse\" that collapses all the files, but I can't seem to find a button to do the exact opposite - to expand all the files in search results. Could we get an \"Expand\" button please? It wouldn't even take up extra space - it could be shown instead of \"Collapse\" button when all files in search results are collapsed, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, I use VSCode daily at

Debug some extension that uses the vscode language-server-protocol (we use cpptools).\r\n2. Edit some document.\r\n\r\nBug#1: After the normal textDocument/didChange is sent, a 2nd duplicate textDocument/didChange with 0 changes gets sent by VS Code. We added code in our extension to check for the 0 change condition, but it's possible other extensions aren't expecting this change in behavior and could crash, etc.. We're okay with the change in behavior if it's intentional/required for some reason, but it would help if the docs explained if/when the 0 change scenario is expected or not.\r\n\r\n3. Switch documents to another document and then back to the dirty edited doc.\r\n\r\nBug#2: The textDocument/didChange with 0 changes gets sent again. Step 3 repeats until a save occurs.\r\n\r\n4.
