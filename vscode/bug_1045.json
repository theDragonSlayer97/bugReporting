Wordwise deleting Two and Three is fine, but pressing Ctrl+Del at the end of the line deletes the whole line, which is IMHO not the intended effect of joining the contents of the following line (and removing leading whitespace). \nSo instead of quickly joining contents I end up having to carefully pay attention and stop at the end of the line, release Ctrl and join the lines with Del only. This is suboptimal. \nI suspect this is not a feature, since deleting lines is usually not performed by placing the cursor at the end and pressing Ctrl+Del? \n\nThanks for fixing this.
