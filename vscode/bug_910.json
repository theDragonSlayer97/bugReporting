VSCode Version: 1.2.0\n- OS Version: any\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open a folder in VSCode that is a git repository.\n2. The git repository is modified without prompting the user (a fetch is performed).\n\nI propose that VSCode should have the `git.autofetch` configuration flag set to `false` by default.  It seems quite unusual that an editor would immediately start modifying a folder simply because it has been opened.  This seems like incorrect default behaviour.  This default behaviour does not exist in any git client that I am aware of.  Fetching is an operation that needs to be done and occasionally may be problematic.\n\nThis appears to have led to a few issues (with a quick search):\n- #2595 (mystery Dropbox updates)\n- #7821 and #7944 (same issue: repeated dialogs)\n- #7409 and #987 (random git locking likely due to fetching in the background)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8469/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8468","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8468/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8468/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8468/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8468","id":162815999,"number":8468,"title":"Uri.with()
