VSCode Version: 1.6.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 7\r\n\r\nHello, I've been having issues with using an extension that builds symbols. I can replicate the issue with both the official C++ and Python extensions.\r\n\r\nSome info about the project:\r\n\r\n- It's large (10k+ files)\r\n- It's mostly on cpp and python, but there's a wide variety of file types\r\n- I've added loads of file extensions to be ignored (not sure if this affects which files are processed)\r\n\r\nRegardless of extension, the auto complete is stuck on `Loading...` most of the time, I imagine that is because the symbols are being built? The symbols also seem to be lost on editor change, resulting in another ~30sec symbol building.\r\n\r\nHowever **Reloading the window** from the command prompt actually refreshes all the symbols and auto complete and builds/loads them in nearly instantly.. until the editor is changed again.\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether this is an extension specific issue, however getting exactly the same problem with 2 completely different extension leads me to believe that there could be a deeper problem in VSCode.\r\n\r\nI'll provide any additional info you want if I can.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Load very large project (the one Im working on is 10k+ files)\r\n2. Need an extension that builds symbols for the language, the problem does not exist if symbols are not being built.\r\n3. Play around with the files and editors, the auto complete will stop working and most of the time will be spent building symbols.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14847","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14847/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14847/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14847/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14847","id":186781832,"number":14847,"title":"Open VS Code file / folder from command line in the same window in a new tab in macOS","user":{"login":"nikitavoloboev","id":6391776,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6391776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitavoloboev","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitavoloboev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitavoloboev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitavoloboev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitavoloboev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitavoloboev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitavoloboev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitavoloboev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitavoloboev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitavoloboev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitavoloboev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-11-02T11:59:44Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T16:18:31Z","closed_at":"2016-11-02T16:18:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.6.1\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.11.6\r\n\r\nI can open Visual Studio Code from cli by using `open -a Visual\\ Studio\\ Code` + file/folder name.\r\n\r\nThis however always opens the file/folder in a new window.
