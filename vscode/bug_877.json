VSCode Version: 1.3.1\n- OS Version: OSX Yosemite 10.10.5\n\nThis could be a mismatch in opinion for the behavior of `clear` or `Ctrl-L` and scrolling (as I believe I've seen this behavior on a Linux Mint machine), but here's my problem:\n\nLet's say I have a lot of output from a certain command in the integrated terminal (mine uses bash). If I enter `clear` or `Ctrl-L`, the terminal gets cleared, which is good! However, if I scroll up, a chunk of output from the verbose command is missing (seems directly related to the height of the terminal window).\n\nWhat I expected: Using _my_ default bash terminal on my Mac, the screen gets cleared, but if I scroll up, **all** the output is still there.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open the integrated terminal (I supply the `-l` option in `settings.json` in order to use my `~/.bash_profile`)\n2. Run a command with lengthy ouput (e.g. `ruby -e 'puts \"START\";100.times { |n| puts \"Line #{ n + 1 }\" };puts \"END\"'`)\n3. Enter `clear`\n4. Scroll up\n\nWith the terminal occupying around 80% of my screen height, I only got output of that Ruby command to around line 50 (i.e. I never see \"END\" after clearing).\n\nIf this is just a matter of terminal opinion, it might be nice to have an option in `settings.json` to define the clear/scroll behavior.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9465","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9465/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9465/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9465/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9465","id":166246608,"number":9465,"title":"Failed to install C/C++ extension on mac","user":{"login":"yihui-he","id":10027339,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10027339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihui-he","html_url":"https://github.com/yihui-he","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihui-he/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihui-he/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihui-he/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihui-he/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihui-he/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihui-he/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihui-he/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihui-he/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihui-he/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-07-19T04:42:04Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T05:07:11Z","closed_at":"2016-07-19T05:07:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:1.3.1\n- OS Version:OS X EI Capitan 10.11.5\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

Add a codeblock between triple backtick code block markers, such as:\n\n<img width=\"175\" alt=\"capture2\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1389609/16929441/ac24aa90-4cec-11e6-990c-8899d0efb533.PNG\">\n1. Notice that there is no syntax highlighting for the code block (different color for the block, that is).\n\nThis seems like a regression because a couple of version ago this was working.\n\n**NOTE:** Disregard the `fsharp` language identifier. If you remove it, there is still no syntax highlight for the block.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9456","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9456/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9456/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9456/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9456","id":166187082,"number":9456,"title":"Explorer:

REPRO HERE: https://github.com/rob3c/tsc-tsnode-vscode-casing-bug-on-windows\n## Overview\n\nStarting with the 2016-07-14 release of Visual Studio Code Insiders edition (and now released in regular VS Code 1.3.1), the behavior of the _Open New Command Prompt_ command (`ctrl+shift+C`) changed on Windows. Now, it lower-cases the drive letter in the new console's prompt, and that seems to affect the ability of at least `ts-node` (and possibly other tools) to build typescript code when the `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames` compiler option is set in _tsconfig.json_.\n## Step 1 - Open two command prompts for comparison\n- Within VS Code, invoke the `Open New Command Prompt` command via `ctrl+shift+C` (or find it using _View | Command Palette..._ in the menu). Notice that the drive letter in the prompt is lower case now!\n- Open a standard Windows Command Prompt outside of VS Code in the normal way, and navigate to this project's root folder. Notice that the standard console has a captial drive letter.\n## Step 2 - create some source files\n\n```\n// tsconfig.json\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n        \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n        \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n        \"outDir\": \"bin\",\n        \"target\": \"es5\"\n    },\n    \"exclude\": [\n        \"bin\",\n        \"node_modules\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n```\n// foo.ts\nexport class Foo {\n    constructor(public bar: string) {}\n}\n```\n\n```\n// index.ts\nimport { Foo } from './foo';\nlet foo = new Foo('bar');\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(foo));\n```\n## Step 3 - Build successfully using typescript directly\n\n```\n> tsc\n```\n\nThis builds successfully in both command prompt windows.\n## Step 4 - Break stuff!\n\n```\n> ts-node index.ts\n```\n\nThis builds and runs successfully in the standard Windows command prompt that has an upper-case drive letter, but it breaks in the console window that VS Code opens with this error:\n\n```\nC:\\dev\\bug-repros\\tsc-tsnode-vscode-casing-bug-on-windows\\node_modules\\ts-node\\src\\index.ts:280\n        throw new TSError(diagnosticList)\n              ^\nTSError: ?

Notice that key bindings/shortcuts are not shown after each item.\n\nEven though the shortcuts are not shown, they do work normally.\n\nOther programs on Ubuntu (e.g. the file manager) show shortcuts as grey text beside the menu item label.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5021259/16924803/5436b4ba-4d21-11e6-90f1-3a78cd26ee11.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9446","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9446/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9446/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9446/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9446","id":166148122,"number":9446,"title":"There are any plan to  support the command from bash for windows ? like git","user":{"login":"TianVan","id":10600430,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10600430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianVan","html_url":"https://github.com/TianVan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianVan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianVan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianVan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianVan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianVan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianVan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianVan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianVan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TianVan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-07-18T17:29:55Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T00:35:24Z","closed_at":"2016-07-18T19:47:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:1.3.1\n- OS Version:windows 10 14390.0\n\nbash for windows is awesome,but the current visual studio code does't support it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4485","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"AF17:2B9C:6F210A:11B9637:59D942D0","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=878>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=876>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"47bec4b96a7b95eb88d8c56f1e73ed0a\"","status":"200 OK"}}
