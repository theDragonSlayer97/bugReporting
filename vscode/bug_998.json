Go](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH)\n- [Install and setup the go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lukehoban.Go)\n- Install gin: `go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin`\n### Repro\n\nCreate a new folder. In it, create a `server.go` file with the following contents:\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport \"github.com/gin-gonic/gin\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    r := gin.Default()\n    r.GET(\"/ping\", func(c *gin.Context) {\n        c.JSON(200, gin.H{\n            \"message\": \"pong\",\n        })\n    })\n    r.Run() // listen and server on 0.0.0.0:8080\n}\n```\n\nSet the debugger config: `\"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/server.go\"`.\n### Repro\n- Set breakpoint on line 8.\n- Start debug.\n- Run `curl http://localhost:8080/ping` to hit the breakpoint.\n- Press `Continue`\n\nThe debugger continues but the UI fails to update that it did continue. This is broken on latest Alpha but not on stable 1.0.0.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5834","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5834/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5834/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5834/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5834","id":151129653,"number":5834,"title":"\"Open
