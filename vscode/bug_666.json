@jrieken \r\n\r\nThe idea here is what we have discussed: make [`ITextModelResolverService`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/15797/files#diff-df9addfcedde446af898cebb60c97b18R16) the one-stop-shop for retrieving (workbench) text editor models, given a `URI`. [The `resolve` method was renamed to a `getModelReference()`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/15797/files#diff-df9addfcedde446af898cebb60c97b18R23) which returns a reference to a model. The contract is to `dispose()` that reference once the caller doesn't need the model any more.\r\n\r\nThis PR adopts that interface and [implements it for the contributable content provider models](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/15797/files#diff-c0f58b9681f8ffe04ae282621f605dd6R125). The other two types ([`file:`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/15797/files#diff-c0f58b9681f8ffe04ae282621f605dd6R114) and [`untitled:`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/15797/files#diff-c0f58b9681f8ffe04ae282621f605dd6R120)) are wrapped around `ImmortalReferences`, which means they will _live_ on forever, just like they have so far, until someone calls `dispose()` on the model itself. This needs adoption in the future. The PR further fulfils the reference contract by calling `dispose()` when the models are no longer needed. @jrieken this is mostly your area.\r\n\r\nThe big goal is to allow proper disposal of text editor models without resorting to ugly methods such as looping through all the open editors. This first step already lets me implement my dirty diff contribution while doing proper model cleanup.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15796","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15796/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15796/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15796/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15796","id":190677332,"number":15796,"title":"Support
