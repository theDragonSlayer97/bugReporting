VSCode uses this [ugly heuristic](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/debug/common/debugModel.ts#L280) to get the parent chain of a variable. We need to get rid of this heuristic since VSCode should be language agnostic and we already have a [field in our protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/debug/common/debugProtocol.d.ts#L1168) that represents this.\r\n\r\nI suggest that node and node2 start supporting this. Once we have that we can notify other debug adapter writers about this field with the goal of droping this heuristic in April.\r\n\r\nAn example where this field is used: adding a variable from the variables view to a watch list or copying a variable value to the clipboard(we first evaluate it using the parent chain)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22944","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22944/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22944/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22944/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22944","id":215675782,"number":22944,"title":"Some keys don't work sometimes in the SCM viewlet's input box.","user":{"login":"kumarharsh","id":760112,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/760112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh","html_url":"https://github.com/kumarharsh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-03-21T09:30:50Z","updated_at":"2017-04-26T09:56:37Z","closed_at":"2017-04-26T09:56:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

It seems like the focus is set to the `diff list` below the textarea, but when I type letters, they get typed in the commit message box. But when I type space, it doesn't work.
