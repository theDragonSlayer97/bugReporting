https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp/issues/412\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use Webpack with a custom loader ([fable-loader](http://fable.io/)) together with Visual Studio Code tasks so the custom loader can highlight warnings and errors directly in the IDE. This is already working fine for single compilations, but not so well in [watch compilations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_background-watching-tasks). The reason is VS Code task configuration requires both `beginsPattern` and `endsPattern` of a watch compilation in the output. However I cannot get Webpack to output a message at the end of a watch compilation **after all warnings and errors** have been displayed. (I've asked in Webpack forum and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43497359/output-message-at-the-end-of-webpack-watch-compilation-after-warnings-and-error) but didn't get a reply.)\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to make the `endsPattern` optional? In this case, every time the `beginsPattern` occurs, VS Code would just reset all errors and warnings previously reported by the task an start over. That would be perfect for my use case.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your support and for the great tool!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25161/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25160","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25160/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25160/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25160/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25160","id":223502147,"number":25160,"title":"Allow

Version: 1.11.2\r\n\r\nI have the [vshaxe](https://github.com/vshaxe/vshaxe) extension cloned into `.vscode/extensions/vshaxe`, which is the usual workflow for working on extensions as far as I can tell. I didn't have the most recent commit pulled yet, so the version in my local `package.json` was behind the officially relased one. This leads to VSCode actually asking me to update the extension (which doesn't make a lot of sense for an extension installed from source):\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/MC22OEx.png)\r\n\r\nWhen you do this, VSCode installs the extension as it usually would, into a `nadako.vshaxe-1.5.1` folder, which then actually _overrides_ the development installation of the extension on the next restart. This alone wouldn't be a huge issue, but I had `\"extensions.autoUpdate\": true` in my settings, so **this happened without me realizing it**.\r\n\r\nIt seems that there's an assumption here somewhere that a development installation of an extension will always have a version that's >= the version of the latest release. However, there are a number of reasons why this might not be the case:\r\n\r\n- As an extension developer, you might not have pulled the most recent commit(s) yet.\r\n- As an extension developler, you might want to check out out older commits to `git bisect` something.\r\n- As an extension user, you might want to install an extension from source to be able to roll back to an earlier version of it because the most recent version broke something (I don't think there's currently another way to install older versions of extensions?

Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.11.1\r\n- OS Version: macos 10.12.4\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nin sass file:\r\n```\r\n.elems {\r\n  display: inline-block;\r\n  float: left;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nfloat property gets a squiggly line and the warning states:\r\n\r\n> Property is ignored due to the display. With 'display: inline-block', float properties have no effect.\r\n\r\nI think this is backwards. Looking at computed properties (chrome) and researching, it seems the exact opposite is true. The display property is ignored and computed as block.\r\n\r\nSome references:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/5854523/2124351\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/27511744/2124351","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4198","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"9E1D:366D:36D559:7C136A:59D93753","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=355>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=353>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"90221bc73e29889f9885467d557e5fd9\"","status":"200 OK"}}
