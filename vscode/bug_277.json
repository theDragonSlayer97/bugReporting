The reason for this is that in the past we would print these symbolic key codes using the US standard produced character and this lead to a lot of confusion. The hope is that by using symbolic names, folks will understand that we are talking about key codes (which don't necessarily correlate with the produced characters). Anyways:\r\n* please check that the symbolic names always come accompanied by an info box instructing towards the produced character (the label of the key)\r\n* please check that you can use both the old way of referring to key codes and the new one: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Keybindings#deciphering-keybindingsjson e.g. `OEM_1` === `;` when it comes to us parsing that file -- so if you defined keybindings before, they will work correctly.\r\n* under the US standard keyboard layout (a majority of our users), we will still render these key codes using the US standard produced character to minimize the noise.\r\n* please check that as you switch keyboard layouts, the fact that a key code is not mapped is reflected with a red indicator and a good message accompanying it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27480","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27480/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27480/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27480/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27480","id":232146300,"number":27480,"title":"Test editor.multicursorModifier","user":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/42","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/42","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/42/labels","id":2454750,"number":42,"title":"May 2017","description":"","creator":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":7,"closed_issues":791,"state":"closed","created_at":"2017-04-13T08:16:51Z","updated_at":"2017-08-28T16:59:09Z","due_on":"2017-06-02T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-06-09T14:14:04Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-30T05:26:54Z","updated_at":"2017-05-31T07:49:58Z","closed_at":"2017-05-31T05:42:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Testing #27193 \r\n\r\n* [x] OSX @bpasero\r\n* [x] windows @chrisdias \r\n* [x] linux @isidorn  \r\n\r\nComplexity: 2\r\n\r\nThere is a new setting `editor.multicursorModifier`.

The hover message on links correctly shows the modifier to be used to open a link.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27480/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27479","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27479/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27479/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27479/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27479","id":232145676,"number":27479,"title":"Test Auto Accessibility Detection in the Editor","user":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/42","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/42","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/42/labels","id":2454750,"number":42,"title":"May 2017","description":"","creator":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":7,"closed_issues":791,"state":"closed","created_at":"2017-04-13T08:16:51Z","updated_at":"2017-08-28T16:59:09Z","due_on":"2017-06-02T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-06-09T14:14:04Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-30T05:21:38Z","updated_at":"2017-05-31T09:41:33Z","closed_at":"2017-05-31T09:41:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Testing #14592 \r\n\r\n- [x] mac with VoiceOver @isidorn \r\n- [x] windows with NVDA + [this plugin that increases the 30ms timeout]\r\n (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26730#issuecomment-303439633) @michelkaporin \r\n\r\nComplexity 3\r\n\r\nWe are now leveraging Electron APIs to detect when Electron/Chromium enables accessibility support. This is done in the main process and communicated to the renderer processes. Please check that:\r\n* when running VS Code, the Ln, Col indicator is shown in the status bar and the `<textarea>` the editor uses for input/output is empty. You can find the `<textarea>` in the dom and use `$0.value` in the console.\r\n* when starting NVDA / VoiceOver with VS Code running, all VS Code windows detect this and the status bar shows \"Screen Reader Detected\". The editor now begins to output screen reader content to the `<textarea>`. You can check this by finding the `<textarea>` in the dom and using `$0.value`. Also, the screen reader should now read the text in the editor. The Ln, Col indicator is removed because it is triggering accessibility events that confuses NVDA.\r\n* please also check other scenarios, such as first starting the screen reader and then launching VS Code, or reloading a window, or opening a new window, etc. In all cases, the fact that a screen reader is attached should be detected. This is important, because otherwise the editor does not output screen reader content to the `<textarea>` (which gives us a nice performance boost)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27478","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27478/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27478/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27478/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27478","id":232143254,"number":27478,"title":"Test:

VSCode Version: 1.13.0-insider\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an `icon A` theme and associate some icon to a `language id` (let's say Elm)\r\n2. Associate another `icon B` to one of the extensions already associated  (in this case the only one `.elm`) by the extension supporting the `language id`. IMPORTANT: `icon B` must be already be in use by a `language id` association.\r\n3. The expected behavior would be that the `.elm` files would show the `B icon` but instead `A icon` is being shown.\r\n\r\nAccording to [vscode api docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/themes-snippets-colorizers#_file-association):\r\n\r\n> A file extension match is preferred over a language match, but is weaker than a file name match.\r\n\r\nAlso, I remember talking to @aeschli about this in [vscode#10804](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10804#issuecomment-243403933).\r\n\r\nYou can also view the original report in [vscode-icons#964](https://github.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons/issues/964), specifically this [comment](https://github.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons/issues/964#issuecomment-304836687)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27475/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4275","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"90CE:366F:C4CAAE:17FCC9A:59D93603","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=278>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=276>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"e185d37c360b8e214f38802a42139a62\"","status":"200 OK"}}
