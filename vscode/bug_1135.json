TextMate is the only editor I know that gets this right!\n\nMany kinds of Unicode characters are wider than normal, some have narrower width;\nin a monospace font, the width should **always** be fixed.\n\nThe fault in VSCode is that such wide/narrow Unicode characters throw off the spacing for the rest of the line -- making it impossible to get back to the same alignment as other lines! (tabs or otherwise)\n\nTextMate displays all Unicode characters at fixed width regardless of their proportional width, including zero-width characters. This is the best behaviour for monospaced source code.\n\nTo avoid some level of confusion over zero-width characters (like Null, zero-width-joiner, bi-di codes &c.) being displayed at full width, whitespace codes could be used (such as when whitespace is visible) -- Unicode provides some visible symbols for non-visible characters, e.g. `␀` (0x2400)\n\n![monospace_unicode](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/142650/12066948/c6334f6e-afe8-11e5-99f0-71cefed03e3b.png)\n\nSo, ideally, what I'm asking for is:\n- All characters, always the same width\n- Better display of non-visible / zero-width characters if possible\n\nI don't have access to TextMate at the moment, but you can use this file as a test, which was written in it: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kroc/DOMTemplate/master/domtemplate.php\n\nKind regards,\nKroc

you are unable to specify installation paths for node modules used by Code via `scripts/npm.sh`, only the architecture. This is an issue for package management systems on Linux where specific packages may \"own\" a set of files or directories, and thus produces conflicts on the system when multiple packages attempt to own the same set of files.\n\nI'm proposing the following options be added to `npm.sh`:\n\n`--installdir=DIR`: This would enable you to specify a general installation directory:\n- Beneficial for build systems that use isolated install directories (where the contents of it are then considered the contents of a binary package) away from the build directories.\n\n`--node-modules=DIR`: This would enable you to specify **the root** of where you want node modules to be installed.\n- Resolves potential file conflicts for packages and pollution of global node_modules.\n\nExamples:\n\n`--installdir=/var/ypkg-root/install/vscode/`: This would be the root of the file system. Installation of binaries such as those placed in `/usr/bin` would begin with the installdir, so it is conceivable that the directory would for the binaries would then be `/var/ypkg-root/install/vscode/usr/bin`.\n- Note: This would only be on the isolated build system, the final contents installed on the user's system would still be /usr/bin, this would just specify where to install things on build-time.\n- Defaults to `/`\n- Sets something like $installdir (used below).\n\n`--node-modules=$installdir/usr/share/vscode/`: This would install node modules to a `node_module` folder in `/usr/share/vscode`. This keeps it isolated from any `npm` or `nodejs` system packages and files. Atom does something similar, with installing things to (_for example_) `/usr/share/atom/resources/...`\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1710","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1710/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1710/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1710/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1710","id":124344904,"number":1710,"title":"Diagnostics
