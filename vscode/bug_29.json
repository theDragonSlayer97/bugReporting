The tasks.json file should look like this:\r\n```ts\r\n{\r\n\t// See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\r\n\t// for the documentation about the tasks.json format\r\n\t\"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n\t\"command\": \"gulp\",\r\n\t\"isShellCommand\": true,\r\n\t\"tasks\": [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"taskName\": \"build\",\r\n\t\t\t\"problemMatcher\": \"$tsc\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- execute the build task again\r\n- Ensure that two problems are detected in the output (the two hard coded written to the console in the gulp file)\r\n- add the following task to the tasks.json file:\r\n```\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"taskName\": \"dir\",\r\n\t\t\t\"command\": \"ls\",\r\n\t\t\t\"windows\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\"command\": \"dir\"\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n```\r\n- execute the task and ensure that a directory listing is shown in the task output channel\r\n\r\n### Task version 2.0.0 in folder workspace setup\r\n\r\n- create a new workspace\r\n- open a as a folder workspace\r\n- install gulp into the workspace\r\n- copy above gulpfile.js into it\r\n- open workspace\r\n- Execute Tasks > Run Tasks\r\n- Ensure that again the build and watch tasks are detected.\r\n- Select the build task\r\n- Ensure that you get prompted to select a problem matcher\r\n- Select $tsc\r\n- Ensure that the gulp build task is executed, that 2 errors are detected and present in the problems view and that a tasks.json file got created with the following content:\r\n```ts\r\n{\r\n\t// See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\r\n\t// for the documentation about the tasks.json format\r\n\t\"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n\t\"tasks\": [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"gulp\",\r\n\t\t\t\"task\": \"build\",\r\n\t\t\t\"problemMatcher\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t\"$tsc\"\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Add the following task to the tasks.json\r\n```ts\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"shell\",\r\n\t\t\t\"taskName\": \"dir\",\r\n\t\t\t\"command\": \"ls -la\",\r\n\t\t\t\"windows\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\"command\": \"dir\"\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n```\r\n- execute it and select `Continue without ...` from the picker\r\n- ensure that a directory listing is printed to the terminal.\r\n- install jake and grunt locally to the workspace.\r\n- create a jake and grunt file with a task. Examples are:\r\n- Jakefile.js\r\n```js\r\ndesc('This is the default task.');\r\ntask('default', function (params) {\r\n  console.log('This is the default task.');\r\n});\r\n\r\ndesc('This is task one.');\r\ntask('taskOne', function (params) {\r\n  console.log('Task One');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n- Gruntfile.js\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = function(grunt) {\r\n\tgrunt.registerTask('taskOne', 'Log some stuff.', function() {\r\n\t\tgrunt.log.write('Logging some stuff...').ok();\r\n\t});\r\n};\r\n```\r\n- ensure that you can execute the grunt and the jake task.\r\n- change a task in either the gulp, grunt or jake file and ensure it is reflected in the task list in VS Code.\r\n\r\n### Task version 2.0.0 in multi folder setup\r\n\r\n- create a new workspace with the the two workspace folders from the tests above \r\n- open the workspace\r\n- ensure that only the tasks in the 2.0.0 folder are detected and shown in the task list.\r\n- ensure that you get a message that the 0.1.0 folder is ignored.\r\n- execute the dir task. Ensure that the terminal list the correct directory. Scoped onto the workspace folder\r\n- execute the gulp build task. Ensure that the problems are correctly detected\r\n- add a new workspace folder tasks-tsc\r\n- create a src folder and inside a test.ts file with the following content:\r\n```ts\r\nconsole.logg(\"Hello World\");\r\n```\r\n- install typescript into the workspace folder\r\n- add a tsconfig.json\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"compilerOptions\": {\r\n\t\t\"module\": \"commonjs\"\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- add a package.json with the following script\r\n```json\r\n\"compile\": \"tsc -p .\"\r\n```\r\n- close all files and reload the window (necessary to clear the TS extension error checking the test.ts file\r\n- Ensure that no problems are detected\r\n- run the npm compile script using the task runner\r\n- when prompted selected the TS problem matcher $tsc\r\n- Ensure that one error is detected\r\n- open the problem view\r\n- Ensure that you can navigate to the problem\r\n- create a watch task in the npm script `tsc -w -p .`\r\n- run it and assign the $tsc-watch problem matcher\r\n- Ensure that Tasks > Terminate Task, Restart and Show work as expected\r\n- Execute Tasks > Configure Tasks\r\n- select npm: install\r\n- ensure that a npm: install task skeleton is added to the tasks.json file in the right workspace folder\r\n- close the tasks.json file\r\n- execute that Tasks > Configure Tasks... again and select the same task\r\n- ensure that the tasks.json file is opened\r\n- Terminate all running tasks\r\n- Run Tasks > Configure Default Build Tasks\r\n- select the npm: watch task\r\n- ensure that the task is marked as the default build task in the tasks.json file\r\n- press Ctrl+Shift+B\r\n- ensure that this starts the watch task\r\n- add a package.json file to the tasks 2.0.0 workspace folder (e.g. npm init)\r\n- add a script to that

Try to debug a program that has underscore as first parameter. Something like this\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n            \"name\": \"Run mocha\",\r\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n            \"type\": \"node\",\r\n            \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}\\\\node_modules\\\\.bin\\\\_mocha\",\r\n            // Automatically stop program after launch.\r\n            \"stopOnEntry\": false,\r\n            // Command line arguments passed to the program.\r\n            \"args\": [\r\n                \"-b\",\r\n                \"--recursive\",\r\n                \"build/test/\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\r\n            // Workspace relative or absolute path to the runtime executable to be used.
