VSCode Version: 1.1.1-insider\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Type any word that conflicts with one of your variable, for example if you have a variable CustomerComponent and you want to have a comment saying \"this is the problem with my Customer.\" when you start typing Customer the CustomerComponent will popup and when you want to insert a period it will auto complete with CustomerComponent\n\nI come across similar behavior when typing import statement like\n\n```\nimport {CustomerComponent} from '/widget/customer.model.ts'\n```\n\nIntellisense will try to autocomplete again in when I type \"customer.\". There the only two instance when this happen, and it seems to happen quite often. I would suggest to switch Intellisense to spellcheck in a comment and perhaps turn it off on import, or have an option where a period wouldn't trigger autocomplete. I'm not too sure about how best to address the import case. The comment case seem to be clearer to have a spellcheck mode, or just simply turn it off if there's no built-in spellcheck.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7325","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7325/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7325/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7325/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7325","id":158920997,"number":7325,"title":"Debugger \"crashes\"","user":{"login":"felixfbecker","id":10532611,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10532611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker","html_url":"https://github.com/felixfbecker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-06-07T13:20:05Z","updated_at":"2016-06-09T07:00:19Z","closed_at":"2016-06-09T06:04:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"vscode-php-debug stopped working after VS Code 1.2, see https://github.com/felixfbecker/vscode-php-debug/issues/39.
