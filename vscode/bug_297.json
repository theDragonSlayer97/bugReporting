Reviewing Default Settings\r\n\r\nOne of the tasks for this iteration is to make a proposal to alter the default for some of our settings.  This is a discussion issue to solicit feedback on a proposal for change.  We are looking at making some changes to improve the discovery of some of our key features and to address user feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Part of a broader assessment of settings\r\nBefore I even get going it's worth sharing some context that this is part of a broader set of investigations that will occur over the next few months.   Some additional context on the broader considerations is contained in issue #26892.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Overview of Changes\r\n\r\n> **NOTE:** Changing the default settings will change the behavior for all users of VS Code - existing and new.  So the lists below are broken into three sections to try an avoid making changes unnecessarily for all users.\r\n\r\n* **Everyone's Defaults** - a proposal that will impact all users\r\n* **Update Process** - although not directly related this will also impact all users\r\n* **Specific Users** - proposal's that relate to a specific set of users only e.g. those coming from Sublime\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes to Everyone's Defaults\r\nThe following settings address the most common feedback we heard from users:\r\n\r\nSetting | Current | Proposed | Notes\r\n--------|-----------------|------------------|------\r\n`editor.minimap.enabled`|`false`|`true`\r\n`workbench.iconTheme`|`none`|`vs-seti`\r\n`editor.dragAndDrop`|`false`|`true`\r\n`window.openFilesInNewWindow`|`default`|`off`\r\n`editor.renderIndentGuides`|`false`|`true`\r\n`editor.renderWhitespace`|`none`|`boundary`\r\n`extensions.autoUpdate`|`false`|`true`\r\n\r\nThis next group we hear less often but none-the-less are candidates for a change in default, for these cases there may  be solid reasons [beyond a preference] why a default change is a bad idea. for instance we may already be experimenting with a default change, or working through some user feedback.\r\n\r\nSetting | Current | Proposed | Notes\r\n--------|-----------------|------------------|------\r\n`editor.mouseWheelZoom`|`false`|`true`\r\n`debug.inlineValues`|`false`|`true`\r\n`workbench.editor.revealIfOpen`|`false`|`true`\r\n`typescript.implementationsCodeLens.enabled`|`false`|`true`\r\n`javascript.implicitProjectConfig.checkJs`|`false`|`true`\r\n`javascript.referencesCodeLens.enabled`|`false`|`true`\r\n\r\n### Bundling a Programmers MonoSpace Font\r\nWe are also considering bundling a font with VS Code to ensure that everyone has a good experience across all platforms from install onwards - more context in [this issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5742#issuecomment-256668325).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes to Update Process\r\nWe are also proposing a few behavior changes to the update process - this will better preserve the users last working state before the update.  While these are actually not a change to the default settings they do have the same effect as changing the following settings which come into effect when you close VS Code and re-open it manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nSetting | Current | Proposed | Notes\r\n--------|-----------------|------------------|------\r\n`window.reopenFolders`|`false`|`all`|Only here for reference - applies to update only\r\n`window.restoreFullscreen`|`false`|`true`|Only here for reference - applies to update only\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes to Specific Users\r\n\r\n### Sublime, Visual Studio\r\n\r\nMay users from Sublime and Visual Studio miss the fact we offer multi-cursor support and column/box selection, these changes would let their muscle memory work better :)  We are only proposing these changes for this class of users as it would otherwise change the `goto definition` binding for all users without warning.\r\n\r\nSetting | Current Default | Proposed Default | Notes\r\n--------|-----------------|------------------|------\r\n`editor.multiCursor.enableCtrlClick`|`false`|`true`|Would swap behavior of `ctrl/alt + click`\r\n`editor.selection.enableCtrlDragColumn`|`false`|`true`|Would swap the behavior of `ctrl/alt + click & drag`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk thats the proposal - let us know what you think.\r\n\r\nSean","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26892","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26892/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26892/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26892/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26892","id":229830862,"number":26892,"title":"Improving the Settings Experience","user":{"login":"seanmcbreen","id":1051190,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1051190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmcbreen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":578047123,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/under-discussion","name":"under-discussion","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"seanmcbreen","id":1051190,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1051190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmcbreen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"seanmcbreen","id":1051190,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1051190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmcbreen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmcbreen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-05-18T23:22:04Z","updated_at":"2017-05-26T16:38:02Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"# Improving the VS Code settings experience\r\n\r\nWe shipped the Alpha of VS Code in April of 2015 (time fly's :) since that point we have evolved the product considerably adding many requested features and enhancements - some of the big ones include Tabs, MiniMap, the Terminal, Workbench theming, Extensions, ... and we have more planned ([roadmap](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Roadmap)).\r\n\r\nWith this evolution we have also evolved the scope of our settings - our `json` files offer a very powerful, transparent and editor friendly way to work with settings.  This is something we MUST preserve - at the same time there is a large group of our users who:\r\n\r\n1. miss a number of our core features - often requesting we add them\r\n2. struggle to work with the `json` files and would love a simplified experience [as an example #3355]\r\n\r\nWe know this is true from our usability studies, our user feedback surveys, or direct customer interactions [in GitHub Issues, Twitter, User Voice and more] so this continues to be an area for us to continue to focus on.\r\n\r\n\r\n## A journey to improve settings\r\n\r\n> **NOTE:** These are investigations and for now we make no commitment to act on any of them - some will work out, some will prove challenging and some will be bad ideas.  We also may not work through the lust in the order presented.\r\n\r\nAs a result I'm proposing a few things we can investigate to improve settings.  Some of this we started a while back so I think of this as a multi stage proposal to improve the experience, the investigations will include (but not be limited to).  \r\n\r\n* Enhance the settings experience in VS Code ([shipped](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_8#_settings))\r\n* Enhance the keybinding experience in VS Code ([shipped](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_11#_keyboard-shortcuts-editor))\r\n* :running_man: Improve defaults i.e. enable some of our key features causing frustration out of the box (under discussion)\r\n* :running_man: Improve comments/tips in settings `json` file e.g. ensure we have good examples for complex names\r\n* Change settings in context e.g. disable mini-map, or code lens with a right click\r\n* Simplified experience for most common settings i.e. provide a simple UI as a complement to the `json` files\r\n* Surface extension settings w/ Extension details i.e. not only list settings contributions for an extension but let you manage them in context\r\n* Make is simpler to edit language over-rides e.g. for `markdown` or `typescript`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26892/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26891","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26891/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26891/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26891/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26891","id":229819967,"number":26891,"title":"How

New version 1.1.0 doesn't appear as an update for the module I have installed (1.0.0)\r\n2. Uninstall 1.0.0\r\n3. Reload Window (I've done several tests, closing and opening VSCode)\r\n4.

Version installed is 1.0.0 again\r\n\r\nI've started asking by Twitter at https://twitter.com/manelrodero/status/865315202845343744 but no solution.\r\n\r\nWhen I uninstall the extension, my \"C:\\Users\\Manel\\.vscode\\extensions\" directory is empty. After I install Powershell extension 1.1.0 searching from VSCode, the \"ms-vscode.PowerShell-1.0.0\" extension appears in my folder. After reload window or close/open vscode, extension is named 1.0.0 as expected per the directory.\r\n\r\nCould it be a problem with extensions repository not updated?
