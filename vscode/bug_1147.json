#1111\n\n@alexandrudima, would be great to get a second pair of eyes in this, mind reviewing? We can do a live code review in Lync, if you want.\n\nHere are my intended changes:\n- The **extension service** should install each extension to a path containing the extension's version. Example: `.vscode/extensions/joaomoreno.uuid-0.0.2`.\n- The `scanPlugin` call should only return the latest extension version, in case there are multiple versions of the same extension installed, per extension folder (global vs user).\n- The **extension service** should clean up old extension versions in the user's extension folder, on startup. Currently set to run once 5 seconds after startup.\n- The **list extensions** action should only display the latest version of an extension.\n\nThis also needs extensive testing, which I will do through today.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1366","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1366/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1366/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1366/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1366","id":122454059,"number":1366,"title":"Error:

of issues I’ve seen in the parser for at-rules:\n- @supports flagged as unknown at-rule. https://drafts.csswg.org/css-conditional-3/#at-supports . This is supported by all browsers now.\n- @-ms-keyframes isn't flagged. This never existed. It is added [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/languages/css/common/parser/cssParser.ts#L480) . There is a note below saying it [doesn't exist](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/languages/css/common/parser/cssParser.ts#L487) but this code doesn't seem to do anything. Removing L480 above fixes it, but I don't know if there should be a more specific error message to show that the prefix was never needed and thus is redundant?\n- For @viewport the method is named _parseMSViewPort instead of _parseViewPort, and only includes the -ms- version. Opera Presto (so Opera Mini still) [supports @-o-viewport](https://dev.opera.com/articles/an-introduction-to-meta-viewport-and-viewport/) and it is a good idea to allow the unprefixed version for forwards compatibility. It is supported behind a flag in Chrome/Opera 15+.\n- Same issue as above for @document, except the method name is named more generically.\n- @counter-style missing. Supported by Firefox (33+). This could hit the two browser rule, but @document is included.\n- Same as above for  @font-feature-values. Firefox 34+.\n\nof the new ones, @supports is probably the most critical to fix as it is widely supported now and we'd like to promote it as a better alternative to UA detection for CSS.\n\nMost of these including all @keyframes also don't syntax highlight properly (beyond general broken CSS highlighting in the insider release), but I can look to fix that in CSS.plist separate from this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1365/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1364","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1364/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1364/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1364/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1364","id":122447052,"number":1364,"title":"Will

whole process of cloning mock-debug to make a debugger extension and then changing it is cumbersome. Like for normal extensions, there should be a yeoman generator that asks you questions about what languages the debugger is for, what the name should be etc.\n\nSecondly, in the docs you express the intent to move the common part of the mock-debug repo to a NPM module, which makes sense, as it's the TS implementation of the debugger protocol so we can write extensions in TS using it. You would be able to add more features over time etc.\n\nI think this would make writing debugger extensions more straight forward.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1355","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1355/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1355/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1355/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1355","id":122384413,"number":1355,"title":"Add

for the convoluted title, also sorry if this is simply user error or misuse of the API.\n\nLong story short, I'm opening the TextDocument like this:\n\n```\nvscode.workspace.openTextDocument(vscode.Uri.parse(\"untitled:\" + lsFullpath)).then(...);\n```\n\nwhere lsFullpath is a full path inside vscode.workspace.rootPath, and immediately call\n\n```\nTextDocument.save()\n```\n\nThis has the intended effect (which might be the API misuse) that a new file (and required non-existent subfolders) is created in the workspace.\n\nHowever, the working files now have the new file with a dirty marker.\n\nAlso, browsing to the file in the workspace (not working files) and opening in the editor and changing it creates a 2nd entry in working files, obviously also dirty at this point.\n\nSaving the file removes dirty marker from the 2nd entry in working files, but changes are not propagated to the 1st entry.\n\nNow selecting 1st entry in working files and saving it kicks out 2nd entry from working files, and overwrites the file (which I guess is to be expected).\n\nThis came up trying for a quick solution for
