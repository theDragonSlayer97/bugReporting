VSCode Version: code-oss-dev 1.16.0 (9066eedcf7597779e3a710bf997d0d9f8748d597)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.15063\r\n---\r\n\r\nI gave `.code-workspace` files another try since they now became suitable for my use-case with support for relative paths (#31203). It works great, as long as I don't add any additional folders to it via the UI and use `Save Workspace As...`. If I do that, VSCode **turns the relative file paths into absolute ones**.\r\n\r\nIn my particular case, this isn't really an issue, since I auto-generate the file, but it still seems like VSCode should try to preserve the \"relativity\" of the file paths so `code-workspace` files can be checked into repositories.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open any workspace with relative paths in its `.code-workspace` file (I'm using [this one](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-demos/blob/dev/flixel-demos.code-workspace)).\r\n1. Add any other folder to that workspace via `File -> Add Folder to Workspace...` (removing a folder works too).\r\n1. Save the workspace with `File -> Save Workspace As...` in the same location.\r\n\r\nAs an example, this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"folders\": [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"Arcade/Breakout\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill be turned into:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"folders\": [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"c:\\\\HaxeToolkit\\\\haxe\\\\lib\\\\flixel-demos\\\\git\\\\Arcade\\\\Breakout\"\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"c:\\\\HaxeToolkit\\\\haxe\\\\lib\\\\flixel-demos\\\\git\\\\Arcade\\\\FlxSnake\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n..when adding the `Arcade/FlxSnake` folder.\r\n\r\nNote: when saving the workspace _without_ adding or removing any folders, the file remains unchanged, which is good.
