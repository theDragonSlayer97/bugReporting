is some existing functionality around viewing definitions of a symbol. I would like to propose an expansion of this: when the user's cursor is on a `require` statement in CommonJS, there is a way to jump to the file that will be returned by that statement. For instance:\n\n``` js\nconst getPageName = require('./get-page-name');\n```\n\nI would like to be able to put my cursor on the `require` statement, hit a hotkey, and then open the `get-page-name.js` file. If the `require` statement is for a node module, like `require('lodash')`, I would expect that hitting the hotkey would open the `main` file of the `lodash` package.\n\nFunctionality very similar to this exists in Webstorm. I use it there all the time.\n\nI would be interested in submitting a PR for this, but I'd like to see if you think this is a good idea
