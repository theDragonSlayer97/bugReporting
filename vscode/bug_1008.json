Set it to an empty string to bring sanity back (with a less cool font, that is 😉 ).

VSCode Version: 1.0.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro\n\nI have no extensions installed. node.js v5.10.1\n\nError highlighting has stopped working in our node.js app - I was able to reduce it to a very minimal test case:\n\nA single index.js containing an erroneous line so you can see if error highlighting is on\nA single subfolder containing a package.json with grunt and grunt-browserify packages and a node_modules folder created by running npm install against the package.json\nStandard vscode files - .vscode/launch.json and jsconfig.json\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. [Clone this repo](https://github.com/nrkn/vscode-error-min/) or [recreate structure above from this gist](https://gist.github.com/nrkn/da6bde225b114d9b8d9f7cf66772c0c9)\n2. Navigate to ./sub and run `npm install`\n3. Open main folder in VSCode\n4. View ./index.js - there is no error highlighting\n\nI have reproduced this on 3 machines\n\nAlmost any change to this minimum case, like removing the node_modules folder, removing `use strict` from the index.js etc., removing the vscode files etc. prevents the bug from being triggered, and error highlighting starts working again, however our app is not a minimal test case so knowing that isn't much help to us!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5529","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5529/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5529/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5529/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5529","id":149656172,"number":5529,"title":"not display the space replacement character in string middle","user":{"login":"sinaku-developer","id":16397370,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16397370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sinaku-developer","html_url":"https://github.com/sinaku-developer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sinaku-developer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sinaku-developer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sinaku-developer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sinaku-developer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sinaku-developer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sinaku-developer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sinaku-developer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sinaku-developer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sinaku-developer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-04-20T04:35:02Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T16:50:29Z","closed_at":"2017-03-01T16:50:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:1.0.0\n- OS Version:OS X EI Capitan 10.11.4\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. ```\n   // エディターで空白文字を表示するかどうかを制御します\n   ```\n   \n   \"editor.renderWhitespace\": false,\n2.    // エディターで空白文字を表示するかどうかを制御します\n   \"editor.renderWhitespace\": true,\n3.

VSCode Version: 1.0.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Add following code to main.ts\n   \n   ``` typescript\n   import { window, commands, OutputChannel, Disposable, ExtensionContext} from 'vscode';\n   \n   let channel: OutputChannel;\n   \n   export function activate(context: ExtensionContext): void {\n   registerCommands(context);\n   channel = window.createOutputChannel('Compile');\n   context.subscriptions.push(channel);\n   }\n   \n   export function deactivate(context: ExtensionContext): void {\n   console.log('deactivated');\n   }\n   \n   function registerCommands(context: ExtensionContext): void {\n   let c1: Disposable = commands.registerCommand('test1', () => {\n       var test: number = 0;\n       (function testFunc() {\n           channel.appendLine(`test: ${test++}`);\n           setTimeout(function(){\n               testFunc();\n           },2000);\n       })();\n   });\n   context.subscriptions.push(c1);\n   }\n   ```\n2. Add this to package.json (remember to change main value to compiled js)\n   \n   ``` json\n   {\n   \"main\": \"<path-to-js>\",\n   \"activationEvents\": [\n       \"onCommand:gcc-compile\"\n   ],\n   \"contributes\": {\n       \"commands\": [\n           {\n               \"command\": \"test1\",\n               \"title\": \"MY TEST 1\"\n           }\n       ]\n   }\n   }\n   ```\n3. When you run the command multiple times, the previous instances don't shutdown. This will create an issue especially if a continuous command (such as watcher) is running. The only way to stop commands is to close Visual Studio Code.\n\nSuggesions:\n1. Function to stop one of the currently running commands.\n2. Force single instance of an extension command.\n3. A function similar to `export function deactivate(context: ExtensionContext)` that runs before every command call. One of the parameters should be an array of currently running commands with the ability to deactivate them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5525","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5525/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5525/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5525/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5525","id":149642358,"number":5525,"title":"Search

recently upgraded to a new monitor that supports NVIDIA's G-SYNC refresh rate syncing technology, and ever since then, Visual Studio Code is completely unusable if I have G-SYNC enabled.\n\nWhenever the window has focus, graphical updates for the entire screen slow to a crawl, because something in VS Code is triggering G-SYNC's ability to adjust the refresh rate of the monitor to match some internal frame rate of the application. Using a built-in feature of the monitor, I can see that the refresh rate is altering based on my interactions with the window, and in some cases dropping to single digit values!\n\nI've seen this behavior in other applications, and the thing they all have in common is that they are all using Electron. I suspect the problem is actually in something Electron is doing with its version of the Chromium code, but I don't know enough about the changes they've made to track down the exact cause. Chrome itself does not exhibit this behavior.\n\nI have found and commented on the following upstream issues:\n\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/issues/2767\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/issues/3026\n\nWhile I know this is actually an Electron problem, I'm posting this here to help raise awareness of the issue, and perhaps get some more traction to actually get this fixed for everyone using Electron.\n- VSCode Version: 1.0.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro 10586.218\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Get a monitor that supports G-SYNC and attach it to a system with an NVIDIA graphics card\n2.  Enable G-SYNC for windowed and full screen mode in the NVIDIA control panel:\n   ![gsync](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/753669/14659305/a940e610-0668-11e6-9bea-224a0abf3b26.png)\n3.
