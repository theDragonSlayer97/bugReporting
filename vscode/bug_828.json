I think it has evolved to a full IDE, with compilation, linters, package managers, taskers and debugging capabilities, among others.\n\nGoing back to the basis, it seems that VSCode can be compiled for iOS platforms, specially the iPad Pro. The principal goal: code reviewing and eventual editing. No need of all the other stuff.\n\nIn summary, we would need the basic Monaco editor, with theme support, syntax highlighting and of course git capabilities. It seems node.js is also supported (see https://github.com/node-app).

@jabooth on August 24, 2016 16:58_\n\nI'm trying to use this new terminal API to implement a `Run File In Terminal` command for the Python plugin: https://github.com/DonJayamanne/pythonVSCode/issues/261. In this use case, I need to instantiate a terminal and immediately send commands to it.\n\nPerhaps I'm a little confused here, but on todays Insider build:\n\n```\nc4f365235906cd689e55376e44cc106003ac06b3\n2016-08-24T06:02:40.440Z\n```\n\nthe following code\n\n``` typescript\nconst terminal = (<any>vscode.window).createTerminal('Test');\nterminal.sendText('echo hello world');\n```\n\nleads to an error:\n\n```\n Error: Terminal has not been initialised yet\n```\n\nas the terminal is asynchronously initialised in the first line.\n\nAs a test, manually adding a delay\n\n``` typescript\nconst terminal = (<any>vscode.window).createTerminal('Test');\nsetTimeout(() => {\n    terminal.sendText('echo hello world');\n}, 1000);\n```\n\nlets everything work.\n\nLooking into this I was going to propose that this API should be promise-based, but then I see this commit from 5 days ago:\n\nhttps://github.com/Tyriar/vscode-terminal-api-example/commit/8a7820e86052090c59e85322f9207e00f19654c1 **API no longer deals with promises**\n\nand the related work on vscode itself (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commit/65888050c33641a5bf9d581f19a7f4094c6feb53)\nwhich moves away from an asynchronous paradigm to this.\n\n@Tyriar I don't see a public API for being told that the terminal is ready for input in the current draft, and I right in thinking this or am I missing something?\n\n_Copied from original issue:
