Probably it's because VS Code decides the language from electron API(which uses Windows API to know that English is the system language and Japanese fonts have a priority compared with Chinese in fonts fallback in this case) instead of locale.json. Is it possible to fix that?\r\nAnd also, for the editor, it would be great to automatically add a line in settings.json like \r\n`\"editor.fontFamily\": \"Consolas, Microsoft Yahei UI Light, 'Courier New', monospace\"`\r\nfor zh-CN VS Code users since the default Chinese font for Chinese User is quite ugly.

Suggesting a feature request to cache/index might be a topic for another issue/discussion. (6-12 seconds to resolve modules for a file)\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xUA7aQ0QGbLnvufMek/giphy.gif)\r\n\r\nDue to the above mentioned intellisense slowness, I faced an issue which does not occur in smaller project -\r\nWhen a file is already opened and the used modules are resolved, each time I open new editor (either directly or with go to definition/peek definition) that was not open - resolving modules is retriggered/refreshed in **every** opened file.\r\n\r\nlogging.js is not opened:\r\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGcD4tD3sDF9FsDS/giphy.gif)\r\n\r\nlogging.js is already opened:\r\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPaaPToLFnolah2/giphy.gif)\r\n\r\nIt is super noticeable when using Command + mouse click/hover to have a quick look on definition (Windows - Ctrl+mouse hover). Command + mouse hover shows a preview which is similar to peek definition, therefore resolving modules is triggered, resulting inconsistent development experience. \r\n\r\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3og0Ixp2XIyFL5iwi4/giphy.gif)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when using Command + mouse click, preview is triggered first and is causing resolving modules - that means a few seconds delay before opening the needed file.\r\n\r\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xUA7bisQCfgwMg3vvq/giphy.gif)\r\n\r\nMy jsconfig.json file content:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n        \"target\": \"ES6\",\r\n        \"module\": \"commonjs\",\r\n        \"baseUrl\": \".\",\r\n    },\r\n    \"exclude\": [\r\n        \"node_modules\",\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n1. If all imported files used by the current file are opened, the experience is smooth.\r\n2. **Every time a file is opened, modules resolving is triggered for all files that are already opened.**","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26161/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26160","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26160/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26160/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26160/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26160","id":226862392,"number":26160,"title":"option
