VSCode Version: 1.13.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 7\r\n\r\nThis has been originally reported [here](/hbenl/vscode-firefox-debug/issues/41)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. start a debugging session using the Chrome or Firefox debug adapter (those are the ones I checked)\r\n2. step into a remote source that can't be mapped to a local path by the debug adapter\r\n3. have a look at the tooltip shown for the remote source - it will display e.g. `http:\\test.com\\file.html` instead of the correct `http://test.com/file.html`\r\n\r\nWhen the debug adapter wants to send a `Source` object for a remote file to VS Code, it can do so by setting the `path` to the URL of the remote file and adding a `sourceReference` which can be used by VS Code to retrieve the file content from the debug adapter.\r\nThis is working fine, except that on Windows the URL is slightly garbled when it's presented to the user in the tooltip - VS Code seems to insist on interpreting the `path` property as a local file path (which is why `/` is replaced with `\\` on Windows), but in this case it's not.\r\nI think VS Code should not modify the `path` property if the `sourceReference` property is set, because this signals that the `Source` object does not correspond to a local file but something else (a remote file or a script passed to `eval()`, for example).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29984","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29984/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29984/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29984/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29984","id":239933784,"number":29984,"title":"Feature
