Linux we usually handle long path files names. When opening the recent list from File menu, it's almost impossible to read file name, since the path is truncated. It happens, for example, when opening a SFTP place or a Samba share from Files that has this path:\r\n\r\n/var/run/user/1000/gvfs/smb-share:server=fsX,share=YYY,user=USER/Applications/blabla/filename.TXT\r\n\r\nIf we can't make the menu larger in width, we could \"cut\" the path in middle, leaving the filename part visible (that's fundamental).\r\nIf we have a recent list showing ONLY paths, it's almost useless :-(\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.9.1\r\n- OS Version: Fedora 25\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20597","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20597/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20597/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20597/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20597","id":207531385,"number":20597,"title":"Debug adapter client sends \"evaluate\" request for watch variable after sending \"continue\" request","user":{"login":"daviwil","id":79405,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/79405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil","html_url":"https://github.com/daviwil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-02-14T14:32:11Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T14:57:57Z","closed_at":"2017-02-23T10:23:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"<!-- Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.8, 1.9\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install PowerShell extension\r\n2. Save this script into a .ps1 file\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$abcdef = 1\r\nwhile ($abcdef -le 50)\r\n{\r\nStart-Sleep -Milliseconds 2000\r\n$abcdef = $abcdef + 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Set a breakpoint on lines 1 and 5 and run the script\r\n4. When breakpoint on line 1 gets hit, set a watch for `$abcdef`\r\n5. Hit continue\r\n6. Debugger now hangs\r\n\r\nFor some reason, the debugger client is sending an `evaluate` request for the `$abcdef` watch variable after the `continue` request is sent and its response is received.  This seems like a bug to me.  Here's what I see in the PowerShell extension logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2/13/2017 5:07:31 PM [VERBOSE] - Method \"ReadMessage\" at line 111 of
