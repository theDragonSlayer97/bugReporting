However, it looks like the view column is always `undefined` for diff editors at least. \r\n\r\nTracing this down the stack, it looks like [`MainThreadDocumentsAndEditors#_onDelta`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/api/electron-browser/mainThreadDocumentsAndEditors.ts#L274) is called with the left hand side of the diff editor as well as the right hand side (both instance of `CodeEditor`). As such, the method [`_findEditorPosition`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/api/electron-browser/mainThreadDocumentsAndEditors.ts#L357) will not function properly because it [compares](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/api/electron-browser/mainThreadEditor.ts#L318) the `CodeEditor` to the `DiffEditorWidget` which is opened. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34458","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34458/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34458/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34458/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34458","id":258022854,"number":34458,"title":"highlight more than 999 items using CMD+F2 does not work.","user":{"login":"lookbehindyouathreeheadedmonkey","id":2925873,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2925873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookbehindyouathreeheadedmonkey","html_url":"https://github.com/lookbehindyouathreeheadedmonkey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookbehindyouathreeheadedmonkey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookbehindyouathreeheadedmonkey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookbehindyouathreeheadedmonkey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookbehindyouathreeheadedmonkey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookbehindyouathreeheadedmonkey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookbehindyouathreeheadedmonkey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookbehindyouathreeheadedmonkey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookbehindyouathreeheadedmonkey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lookbehindyouathreeheadedmonkey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":705271259,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-1000-limit","name":"editor-1000-limit","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-15T12:26:50Z","updated_at":"2017-09-28T10:01:03Z","closed_at":"2017-09-28T10:00:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code -
