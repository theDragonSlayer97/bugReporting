Paste the following code snippet into VS Code\n\n```\nexport class Test {\n    private static _meta = {\n        foo: \"string\"\n    };\n\n    private p = Test._meta;\n\n    private static test(me: Test) {\n        var myTestVar = me.p.foo;\n    }\n}\n```\n1. Right click on foo on line 3 and select rename symbol\n2. Change \"foo\" to \"fooNew\" and press enter\n3. Expected: me.p.foo should be updated to me.p.fooNew\n4. Actual: rename does not work leaving broken code that does not build\n\nIt may be worth mentioning that this code snippet is just a trivial example to highlight the problem. So in case you are wondering why anyone would want to do this, we do have a valid use case that's just too complex to put here. Also, Visual Studio handles the refactoring just fine.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6021/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6020","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6020/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6020/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6020/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6020","id":152039879,"number":6020,"title":"shortcut

Create the following project structure.\n2. Open the root folder in VS Code.\n3. Observe errors and poor Intellisense in ./src/entry.js.\n\nIt appears that the \"Node module resolution\" support in VS Code is incomplete, and only understands two variants:\n- how to resolve a single [file as a module](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_file_modules) (e.g., ./src/node_modules/foo.ts),\n- how to resolve a [folder as a module](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_folders_as_modules) that contains an \"index\" file (e.g., ./src/node_modules/bar/index.ts).\n\nIt doesn't understand the third variant:\n- how to resolve a [folder as a module](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_folders_as_modules) that contains a \"package\" file (e.g., ./src/node_modules/baz/package.json pointing to ./src/node_modules/baz/main.ts).\n\nAll three of these variants (in any mixture) are _vital_ to proper support for \"Node module resolution\" in modular Node project structures.\n\nAlso, _none_ of these variants work when the file extensions are .js instead of .ts (even when using a jsconfig.json file or allowJs=true).  This is terrible, and makes VS Code useless for navigating many existing Javascript projects.  The fact than any of the variants work for .ts files is great, but they should definitely work for .js files!\n\n**./tsconfig.json**\n\n```\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"module\":
