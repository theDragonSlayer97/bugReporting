PR introduces a `BackupsFileModel` to `BackupFileService`. It resolves all backups that exist for a workspace on startup and keeps itself updated when changes to backups are made. Thus it avoids the constant disk lookup when resolving files or untitled models (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15653)\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, it associates the `versionId` of the model with the resource that was backed up and thus allows to avoid backing up content of a model that is already backed up (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14075).\r\n\r\n**Fixes**:\r\n* Avoid checking for backups on each resolve() of file/untitled (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15653)\r\n* Hot Exit: backup all ignores existing backups? (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14075)\r\n\r\n@Tyriar I would think that the `BackupsFileModel` is also the right place of reading the meta data of the backups for https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15718 to keep everything in one place. Once that is in, `IBackupFileService` should get a method that returns the paths of file and untitled resources that contain backups.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15891","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15891/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15891/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15891/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15891","id":191036443,"number":15891,"title":"Ability to Toggle SideBar panels with the same shortcut","user":{"login":"normalser","id":1723815,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1723815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normalser","html_url":"https://github.com/normalser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normalser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normalser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normalser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normalser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normalser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normalser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normalser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normalser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normalser/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-11-22T15:22:54Z","updated_at":"2016-11-23T08:34:16Z","closed_at":"2016-11-23T08:34:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Not sure if you/others will agree but it would be nice to be able to open (collapsed) SideBar panel (eg.

I read all previous post here and on the web but I was not able to find a fix for my environment.\r\n\r\nI tried to setup proxy in settings without authorization\r\n```\r\n    \"http.proxy\": \"http://proxy_address:8080\",\r\n    \"https.proxy\": \"http://proxy_address:8080\",\r\n    \"http.proxyStrictSSL\": false\r\n```\r\nand I tried also with authorization, that is usually required by our corporate proxy (BlueCoat)\r\n```\r\n    \"http.proxy\": \"http://domain%5Cusername:password@proxy_address:8080\",\r\n    \"https.proxy\": \"http://domain%5Cusername:password@proxy_address:8080\",        \r\n    \"http.proxyStrictSSL\": false\r\n```\r\nIn both in this case the error message : **Error read ECONNRESET**\r\n\r\nThe very strange thing is that with Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise I can browser the extensions.\r\nI decide so to monitor the HTTP traffic using WireShark but I was not able to find the differences the two call looks very similar but in case of VS Code the connection is dropped, in the other case it works.\r\n\r\nI checked the two destination addresses and I can open both in HTTPS without problem with the browser on the same machine.\r\n\r\n### WireShark
