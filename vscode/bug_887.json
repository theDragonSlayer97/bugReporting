First off, kudos! Just switched from sublime text 3 a week ago and I'm liking what I see. One big issue I've faced: Intellisense stops working if my project gets too large. I've done the following to narrow the issue down:\n1. Disabled all plugins. _INTELLISENSE DOESN'T WORK_\n2. Duplicated the project without .git folder and opened in VSCode. _INTELLISENSE DOESN'T WORK_\n3. Opened a single file/small project. _WORKS_ \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a large project (10,000+ LoC, node_modules ignored). \n2. Setup a git repo\n3. Work for a couple of days (I've made 100+ commits in the past 5 days. It stopped working 3 days in)\n\nP.S: It's a sails.js project\n\nThnx\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9171","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9171/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9171/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9171/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9171","id":165245358,"number":9171,"title":"issue with package.json","user":{"login":"nate2009","id":20432742,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/20432742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nate2009","html_url":"https://github.com/nate2009","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nate2009/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nate2009/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nate2009/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nate2009/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nate2009/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nate2009/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nate2009/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nate2009/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nate2009/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-07-13T06:15:49Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T18:56:52Z","closed_at":"2016-07-13T23:31:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:\n- OS Version:\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
