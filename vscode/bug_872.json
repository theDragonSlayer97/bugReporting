VSCode Version: 1.3.1 and 1.4.0-insider \n- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro x64\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open a folder in VS Code that uses Gulp as task runner and has a tasks.json that defines all the tasks\n2. Type in the task command\n\n![animation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10532611/17051431/06f6cfc0-4ff9-11e6-868e-e16b91a9e10c.gif)\n\nThis is running on a Surface Pro 3. Even on my PC it is slow though.\nIt seems like VS Code first runs Gulp to get a list of tasks even thought they are already all defined in tasks.json:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"command\": \"gulp\",\n  \"isShellCommand\": true,\n  \"showOutput\": \"always\",\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"taskName\": \"ts\",\n      \"problemMatcher\": \"$tsc\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"taskName\": \"watch-ts\",\n      \"isWatching\": true,\n      \"problemMatcher\": {\n        \"base\": \"$tsc-watch\",\n        \"watchedTaskBeginsRegExp\": \"Starting\",\n        \"watchedTaskEndsRegExp\": \"Finished\"\n      }\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nI appreciate that VS Code asks Gulp to get tasks that may not have been defined, but it should at least show the tasks in tasks.json first, and then extend the list once Gulp returns. Our Gulpfile is pretty big, while I expect the parsing of the JSON to be almost instant.\n\nAlso, when I already type in the task name and hit enter, VS Code should not wait till the tasks are loaded and instead just run that task directly. The fuzzy searching is not beneficial for the task picker.\n\nIt also seems like every character you type into the picker while the tasks are loading will abort and restart the whole process, which doesn't make sense.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9613/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9612","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9612/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9612/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9612/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9612","id":166996809,"number":9612,"title":"Error

Webpack produces warnings in the following format when you accidentally use an import with the wrong case in the file path: (i.e. ./**C**omponents/SomeComponent vs ./**c**omponents/SomeComponent)\n\n```\nWARNING in ./src/Components/SomeComponent.tsx\nThere is another module with an equal name when case is ignored.\nThis can lead to unexpected behavior when compiling on a filesystem with other case-semantic.\nRename module if multiple modules are expected or use equal casing if one module is expected.\n```\n\nNow when I try to use the following problem matcher for this:\n\n```\n                {\n                    \"owner\": \"webpack\",\n                    \"fileLocation\": \"relative\",\n                    \"severity\": \"warning\",\n                    \"pattern\": [                        \n                        {\n                            \"regexp\": \"WARNING in (.*)\",\n                            \"file\": 1\n                        }\n                        ,{\n                            \"regexp\": \"(.*)$\",\n                            \"message\": 1,\n                            \"loop\": true\n                        }\n                    ]                   \n                }\n```\n\nI get the following message when trying to build the project:\n\n> The problem pattern is invalid. It must have at least a file, message and line or location match group.\n\nSo it seems that the problem matcher validation logic requires that there is a location (line,col) for a rule to be valid.  Couldn't the default just being the first line / column of a file so that the matcher could handle scenarios like this where its a file in general that produces the warning?\n\nI admit, I feel like Webpack's warning should include a line/col as it is complaining about a specific import.  But it would also be nice to be able to handle plugins that aren't necessarily being good citizens with respects to the output they surface.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9598","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9598/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9598/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9598/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9598","id":166917594,"number":9598,"title":"Debug
