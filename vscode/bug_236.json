VSCode Version: 1.13.0\r\n- OS Version: Linux Mint\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Generate a new extension (`yo code`)\r\n2. Set `activationEvents` in **package.json**:\r\n    ```json\r\n    \"activationEvents\": [\r\n        \"onLanguage:plaintext\"\r\n    ],\r\n    ```\r\n3. Add the following line to `activate` in **extension.[tj]s**:\r\n    ```js\r\n    console.log('Workspace files: ' + vscode.workspace.textDocuments.map(d => d.fileName).join(', '));\r\n    ```\r\n4. Hit F5 to debug the extension\r\n\r\n### Observed Behavior:\r\nIf the welcome screen is displayed, the extension is activated and **/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/vs/workbench/parts/welcome/page/electron-browser/vs_code_welcome_page** is listed as a workspace file. (which I conclude to mean triggered the activation).  Inspecting the URI shows it has the **walkThrough:/** scheme.\r\n\r\nIf you are in a git repository opening any type of file caused the extension to be activated by a file ending in **.git** (dot git).  Inspecting the URI shows this file has the scheme, **git:/**\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior:\r\nExtensions not be activated for these virtual files because it does not make sense to check or interact with them  Alternatively, there should be a way to specify which schemes should activate an extension.\r\n\r\nNote: My expectation here also applies to `documentSelector` behavior in `LanguageClientOptions` in **vscode-languageclient**.  I can open an issue for that if desired.\r\n___\r\nAffected extension: adamvoss/vscode-languagetool#2","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28731","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28731/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28731/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28731/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28731","id":235922488,"number":28731,"title":"Feature Request: Add Setting to open VS Code without default unsaved tab being opened [closed as duplicate]","user":{"login":"deadlydog","id":1187140,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1187140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog","html_url":"https://github.com/deadlydog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-14T15:38:01Z","updated_at":"2017-06-14T20:17:57Z","closed_at":"2017-06-14T19:55:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

Close all files/tabs in VS code.\r\n2. Close VS code.\r\n3. Open VS code.\r\n\r\nThe application will open up with a default `Untitled-1` tab already open that you can start typing into.\r\nIt would be nice to have a setting that allows VS Code to start without opening any tabs. e.g. it looks like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1187140/27140993-40ef410c-50e4-11e7-995c-36b82fbf0e52.png)\r\n\r\nThe reason this is desirable is I often open VS Code and then open the file I'm after, by using Ctrl+O or the `File -> Open Recent` menu.

blank.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28731/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28730","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28730/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28730/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28730/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28730","id":235917733,"number":28730,"title":"Breakpoints
