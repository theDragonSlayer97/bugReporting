What is the correct steps to import and use a npm module?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4207","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4207/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4207/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4207/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4207","id":140788938,"number":4207,"title":"Typescript intellisense doesn't work for files listed in tsconfig.json","user":{"login":"RANUX","id":1157667,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1157667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RANUX","html_url":"https://github.com/RANUX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RANUX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RANUX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RANUX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RANUX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RANUX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RANUX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RANUX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RANUX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RANUX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-03-14T20:28:58Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T10:39:23Z","closed_at":"2016-03-15T08:29:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 0.10.10\n- OS Version: OS X Yosemite\n\nIntellisense doesn't work when i manually list files in \"files\" directive in tsconfig.json.
