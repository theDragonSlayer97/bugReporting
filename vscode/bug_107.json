Here is a sample file, never mind the stupidity or validity of the subject:\r\n\r\n```\r\nenum HorseType {\r\n    Striped = 'striped',\r\n    Plain = 'plain',\r\n    Green = 'green'\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Horse {\r\n    type: HorseType\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Zebra extends Horse {\r\n    type: HorseType.Plain\r\n    zooName: string\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface DomesticHorse extends Horse {\r\n    type: HorseType.Plain\r\n    horseName: string\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype NormalHorse = Zebra | NormalHorse\r\n\r\nconst testZebra: Zebra = {\r\n    zooName: 'Ueno Zoo'\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction horseIsZebra(horse: NormalHorse): boolean {\r\n    return horse.type === HorseType.<CURSOR_HERE>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. The auto completion that shows up at `<CURSOR_HERE>` shows all the three options for `HorseType` even though we know that `horse` being of type `NormalHorse` can only have the values `Plain` or `Zebra`, not `Green`. So, `Green` should be filtered out in this case.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32602","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32602/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32602/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32602/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32602","id":250489999,"number":32602,"title":"Updated after completion of react inside the HTML5 code has a problem.
