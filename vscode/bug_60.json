This can usually also be done with `Ctrl + n` (up) and `Ctrl + p` (down) in a regular terminal. In VSCode these shortcuts are already used for different actions and are therefore not passed to the terminal (`Ctrl +n` opens a new, empty file, while `Ctrl + p` brings up the file selection).\r\n\r\nAt least so I thought. Turns out that while `Ctrl + n` is configured to open a new file globally, the shortcut is actually passed to the terminal. This, however, does not happen for `Ctrl + p`.

This is not done, but it's not a blocker to the API finalization.\r\n\r\nWith the new API,\r\n\r\n* The title of Color Picker only shows four color format, RGB, HEX, HSL, HSA, which are representatives of RGB color model. When users click on it, we iterate through them.\r\n* When users move the cursor inside the saturation box, we only make updates to the document when mouse up.\r\n* Since we only make changes when the color is finalized (mouse up), we ask the provider for string representative of selected color. We don't flood the extensions of both API call or content change.\r\n* Extensions format the color per Color Format users select in the color picker.\r\n\r\nFor now, the four formats are good enough as long as we are only targeting RGB color model. If there is other feature request, we need to update both `provideColorRange` and `resolveColor` as the color can no longer be represented as RGB. cc @joaomoreno @jrieken ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34001/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4492","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"8E2C:429A:80D89B:159DA47:59D93215","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=61>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=59>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"958499385e260772af7e12fb9d3dfc63\"","status":"200 OK"}}
