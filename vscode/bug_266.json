Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.12\r\n- OS Version: MacOS 10.12.5 & Ubuntu 16.04\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI've set up a tasks.json file for building a project on multiple platforms. All platforms see the same content of the project repository. This is done either via disk sharing, because of running another platform in a VM, or via sync with the Git repository. So far so good, they all see the same task.json. However some command lines are rather long and those long lines are identical for most part. For example:\r\n\r\n`\"rm -rf build; mkdir build; cd build; ../configure --with-bash-malloc=no CFLAGS=\\\"-O3 -fno-builtin-malloc -fno-builtin-calloc -fno-builtin-realloc -fno-builtin-free\\\" LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib LIBS=\\\"-ltcmalloc -lcurl\\\" CC=clang`\r\n\r\nSimilar lines are there for the different platforms. The configure part is always the same for the different platforms, so it would be nice to factor out this common part. Thus the question is if it is possible to define your own variables, so you can use them similar to ${workspaceRoot}.\r\n\r\nThus define somewhere\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"win_dir\": \"build_windows\",\r\n\"linux_dir\": \"build\",\r\n\"osx_dir\": \"build_osx\",\r\n\"configure\": \"../configure --with-bash-malloc=no CFLAGS=\\\"-O3 -fno-builtin-malloc -fno-builtin-calloc -fno-builtin-realloc -fno-builtin-free\\\" LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib LIBS=\\\"-ltcmalloc -lcurl\\\" CC=clang\"\r\n```\r\nAnd then write\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"tasks\": [\r\n    {\r\n        \"taskName\": \"configure\",\r\n        \"command\": \"bash\",\r\n        \"windows\": {\r\n            \"args\": [\"-c\", \"rm -rf ${win_dir}; mkdir ${win_dir}; cd ${win_dir}; ${configure}\"]\r\n        },\r\n        \"linux\": {\r\n            \"args\": [\"-c\", \"rm -rf ${linux_dir}; mkdir ${linux_dir}; cd ${linux_dir}; ${configure}\"]\r\n        },\r\n        \"osx\": {\r\n            \"args\": [\"-c\", \"rm -rf ${osx_dir}; mkdir ${osx_dir}; cd ${osx_dir}; ${configure}\"]\r\n        },\r\n        \"isBuildCommand\": true,\r\n        \"problemMatcher\": \"$make-compile\"\r\n    },\r\n    ... others tasks using the variables\r\n```\r\nWhen making changes to the build directory or arguments passed to configure etc, then the tasks.json file needs only editing at one place, instead of many.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is already possible but I'm unable to find out how. I tried to do something with the declares block, but that seems to be hard tied to problemMatcher. You can find some examples, but I could not find clear documentation of of the elements of the tasks.json file and how they interact.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm missing something, please educate me!\r\n\r\nWhile at it, some sort of macro expansion would be nice also.\r\nthat would allow e.g.\r\n\"configure_cmd_line($1)\": \"rm -rf ${$1}; mkdir ${$1}; cd ${$1}; ${configure}\"\r\n\r\nand the args part would then become:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n\"linux\": {\r\n            \"args\": [\"-c\", \"configure_cmd_line(${linux_dir})\"]\r\n        },\r\n...\r\n```\r\nI do not care so much about the actual syntax, as long as it is possible to factor out common used patterns that repeat themselves in the tasks.json file, especially with multi platform builds. That would make it much more easier to maintain and copy them from one project to another and only slightly modify them in at least as possible places as possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27829/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27828","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27828/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27828/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27828/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27828","id":232817239,"number":27828,"title":"VS Code's Source control doesn't show controls","user":{"login":"Kenya-West","id":12271104,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12271104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenya-West","html_url":"https://github.com/Kenya-West","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenya-West/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenya-West/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenya-West/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenya-West/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenya-West/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenya-West/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenya-West/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenya-West/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenya-West/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-01T09:25:03Z","updated_at":"2017-06-13T15:15:40Z","closed_at":"2017-06-13T15:15:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
