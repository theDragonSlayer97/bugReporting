Install Cygwin\n2. Edit .vscode/settings.json to set `git.path` to point to `\"\\\\cygwin64\\\\bin\\\\git.exe`\n3. VS Code throws up an error message of `ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat 'C:\\cygdrive'`, as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36508177/visual-studio-code-cannot-detect-cygwin-git-exe-path)\n\nThis is, of course, because Cygwin namespaces the filesystem differently. However, doing this (which usually fixes things in other tools):\n\n```\n        \"git.path\": \"\\\\cygwin64\\\\bin\\\\bash.exe git\",\n```\n\n...then results in further confusion as Code apparently does not have a way to correctly set the environment for the git process, which then defaults to the wrong PATH:\n\n```\ngit fetch\ngit show HEAD:.vscode/settings.json\ngit show HEAD:.vscode/settings.json\nCould not create directory '/c/cygwin64/home/USERNAME/.ssh'.\nssh_askpass: exec(/usr/local/bin/win-ssh-askpass.exe): No such file or directory\nHost key verification failed.\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\n\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights\nand the repository exists.\ngit fetch\nCould not create directory '/c/cygwin64/home/USERNAME/.ssh'.\nssh_askpass: exec(/usr/local/bin/win-ssh-askpass.exe): No such file or directory\nHost key verification failed.\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\n\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights\nand the repository exists.\n```\n\nTrying to set PATH, HOME, etc. inline in the `bash` command line above fails for some reason I cannot yet fathom, but I would suggest a configuration setting `git.env` be created so that the environment external Git tools can be pre-configured (this would also benefit the Linux and OSX ports).\n\nAs to why this is necessary and why I can't use other Git binaries on Windows, the reason is simple: \n\nCygwin does Git over SSH \"right\", with completely identical setup in terms of SSH keys, options, CR/LF encoding, etc. Current Git for Windows simply does not work for my use case (I've tried), and, obviously, the Linux Subsystem doesn't help with this either.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7998/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7997","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7997/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7997/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7997/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7997","id":161661821,"number":7997,"title":"1.2.1

Code Version 1.2.1\nCommit fe7f407b95b7f78405846188259504b34ef72761\nDate 2016-06-14T13:00:22.146Z\nShell 0.37.6\nRenderer 49.0.2623.75\nNode 5.10.0\nWindows 10 Enterprise x64, latest non-Insider\ngit version 2.9.0.windows.1\n\nDescription: during a Git merge process, VSCode can sometimes show no pending changes and refuse to let me commit, while command-line Git believes a merge is in progress and lets me commit. This occurs if the changed file contains no changes (after merge) that came from the commit that I am merging into my local state.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create Git repository (e.g. on GitHub).\n2. Clone to working folder A.\n3. In working folder A, commit a file with some arbitrary text. Commit and sync\n4. Clone to working folder B.\n5. In working folder B, change some part of the file. Commit and sync.\n6. In working folder A, change some part of the file, conflicting with previous. Commit and sync.\n\nThis will result in a merge conflict due to the change from working folder B getting pulled.\n\nResolve the conflict by removing all changes pulled form working folder B - the file should be the same as the committed state that existed in working folder A. Stage the file to mark the file as resolved.\n\nExpected result: file is staged and VSCode lets you commit the merge.\n\nActual result: file disappears from Git tab and VSCode says cannot commit as there are no pending changes.\n\n`git commit` from the command line works fine to finish the merge, only VSCode refuses to cooperate here.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7988","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7988/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7988/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7988/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7988","id":161638139,"number":7988,"title":"Installing

code I just wrote, but the automatic Parameter Hinting pop-up box often covers up the previous lines, sometimes hiding up to the previous 4 lines of code! This can be especially annoying when the parameters I am typing span multiple lines.\nTo fix this problem I have been adding the following custom CSS style to the VSCode Developer Tools:\n`.editor-widget:hover { opacity: .15; }` \nHowever, it would be nice if there was a way that I could disable the Parameter Hinting so I don't have to press `ESC` each time I am typing parameters and want to get rid of the hinting box. A different fix to this problem would be if the parameter hinting was out of the way, by being below the current line of code for example.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7984/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7983","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7983/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7983/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7983/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7983","id":161633880,"number":7983,"title":"Duplicate

was very delighted to find out that HTML previews could run JavaScript, which is the whole reason my vscode-map-preview extension (https://github.com/jumpinjackie/vscode-map-preview) exists.\n\nOne of the questions I have, is that the HTML preview I generate with the extension is not so much content, but a combination of an interactive viewer \"container\" into the actual content that is also embedded into the same preview HTML.\n\nOne of the small annoyances is that I have to sanitize the document content for any unruly characters before embedding into the preview HTML so that the content doesn't break out of the ES6 template string that I have defined in the preview HTML script block for this content.\n\nWhat would be nicer and cleaner for me is if instead of embedding the document content into the preview HTML, is if I could define a 2 virtual documents (with their own URI schemes):\n1. For the viewer \"container\" HTML \n2. For the actual document content\n\nThen HTML preview I generate from the 1st virtual document can fetch/XHR the content from, allowing for the graceful ability to handle failures in setting up the preview. Currently any failures in previewing content are mostly silent, and I would have to physically dump the preview HTML content out to a separate file in my extension code and open that up in Chrome to see what's wrong with it. \n\nIs this possible to make fetch/XHR inside a HTML preview work with virtual documents in vscode?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7974","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7974/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7974/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7974/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7974","id":161620681,"number":7974,"title":"Key
