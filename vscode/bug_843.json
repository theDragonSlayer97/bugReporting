I have to point out that i`m a noob in vscode.\nIt doesn't recognise the iostream header, unless i edit c_cpp_properties.json file.\nBy default, in this config file the includePath is set to \"includePath\": [\"/usr/include\"]. \nIn order to make vscode compile my program, i needed to edit the includePath to  [\"/usr/include/\"].\nThe odd behaviour is that vscode does not show the error below for all programs.\nSome programs are compiled without modifying the includePath.\n\n![include_error_in_vsc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11255266/17642356/dde6a944-614a-11e6-95e0-f6cdc60f44be.PNG)\n\nIf you have any ideas why this is happening, please share them, i would like to edit vscode's settings to take effect globally, on all c++ programs, without having to manually edit the includePath individually for each c++ program.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10494","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10494/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10494/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10494/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10494","id":170996439,"number":10494,"title":"when

This can be very annoying if both of these are true: \n\n a) the app being debugged is printing something regularly\n b) you are scrolling up trying to read something that was already scrolled out of view\n\nBasically, it is impossible to read output already out of view because the view just keep snapping back to the bottom.\n\nThe way this works in Linux terminal is that the 'scroll to new output' behavior is automatically disabled when I scroll up. Conversely, it also gets auto-enabled when I scroll back down to the bottom.\n\nIn other words _if_ I am already scrolled so that I'm looking at the logs 'tail' then the view keeps the tail scrolled into view as new output appears. But if I'm not currently looking at the tail, then it doesn't auto-scroll. \n\nThis is exactly how it should work I think. If that's too hard to implement, then at least give the user some kind of button to toggle scroll-lock on / off.\n\nPS: I observed the annoying scrolling behavior in DEBUG console, but it really applies to all consoles (e.g. 'build' task console with 'watching' behavior).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10486/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10485","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10485/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10485/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10485/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10485","id":170924100,"number":10485,"title":"Reusing repo README for marketplace is restrictive;

Switch back to the original language.\n\nExpected behavior:\nThe editor should reevaluate the language and remove the error decorators from the old language.\n\nActual behavior:\nAfter the second language switch, the error decorators from the old language remain, and new code is still treated as the second language for diagnostics.\n\nThis can be reproduced at the [monaco editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/playground.html) with the following code\n\n```\n// validation settings\nmonaco.languages.typescript.javascriptDefaults.setDiagnosticsOptions({\n    noSemanticValidation: true,\n    noSyntaxValidation: false\n});\n\n// compiler options\nmonaco.languages.typescript.javascriptDefaults.setCompilerOptions({\n    target: monaco.languages.typescript.ScriptTarget.ES6,\n    allowNonTsExtensions: true\n});\n\n\nvar jsCode = 'const foo = 42;';\n\nvar editor = monaco.editor.create(document.getElementById(\"container\"), {\n    value: jsCode,\n    language: \"javascript\"\n});\n\neditor.addAction({\n    id: \"lang_js\",\n    label: \"lang to js\",\n    run: () => {\n        monaco.editor.setModelLanguage(editor.getModel(), \"javascript\");\n    }\n});\n\neditor.addAction({\n    id: \"lang_json\",\n    label: \"lang to json\",\n    run: () => {\n        monaco.editor.setModelLanguage(editor.getModel(), \"json\");\n    }\n});\n```\n\nTo cause the issue, invoke the \"lang to json\" action, then the \"lang to js\" action.  The json language will flag const as \"Expected a JSON object, array, or literal\".  This error will remain even when the language is switched back into javascript.  Additionally, any additional code typed into the editor will always be processed with json, regardless of which language is set.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10482","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10482/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10482/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10482/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10482","id":170913416,"number":10482,"title":"Issue with VbScript code","user":{"login":"dlbjr","id":20995343,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/20995343?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlbjr","html_url":"https://github.com/dlbjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlbjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlbjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlbjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlbjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlbjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlbjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlbjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlbjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlbjr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-12T16:51:35Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T23:41:08Z","closed_at":"2016-11-30T23:41:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.5.0-insider (e9c80f036645caae7759b3954fc72dbe6c644edf, 2016-08-12T06:07:39.195Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 6.1.7601\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

It works fine on Jenkins (Linux and OS X) but fails on AppVeyor. I can repro on my Windows desktop.\n\nI'm running `npm test` (I presume this is correct - it seems to do the expected thing on Linux/Mac) but I get this output:\n\n```\nnpm test --silent\n### VS Code Extension Test Run ###\nCurrent working directory: C:\\projects\\dart-code\nDownloading VS Code into \"C:\\projects\\dart-code\\.vscode-test\" from: https://vscode-update.azurewebsites.net/1.4.0/linux-x64/stable\nRunning extension tests: C:\\projects\\dart-code\\.vscode-test\\VSCode-linux-x64\\code C:\\projects\\dart-code\\out\\test --extensionDevelopmentPath=C:\\projects\\dart-code --extensionTestsPath=C:\\projects\\dart-code\\out\\test\nFailed to execute tests: Error: spawn C:\\projects\\dart-code\\.vscode-test\\VSCode-linux-x64\\code ENOENT\nTests exited with code: -4058\nCommand exited with code 1\n```\n\nIt seems to be downloading a **Linux** version of code. I tracked this back to `node_modules/vscode/bin/test` which has a platform check that only supports Linux and Mac:\n\n```\nvar platform = (process.platform === 'darwin') ? 'darwin' : 'linux-x64';\n```\n\nSo, two questions:\n1. What's the correct way to run tests on Windows/AppVeyor (I found [this](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/5979/files) though I'm not sure if relevant)\n2. Is there any reason `npm test` can't be made to work? All the pieces are cross-platform, it would be nice if this just worked the same

If you put your cursor inside an item, it works as expected:\n\n![As expected](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1078012/17621440/3c05ea28-608b-11e6-88d0-aa69416d173f.png)\n\nHowever if you double-click to highlight the element, then the results from the document highlight are overriden (or supplemented with) word highlgihts be vscode (resulting in incorrect things behind highlighted):\n\n![Not expected](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1078012/17621457/5598b128-608b-11e6-973b-3c82df88b3c4.png)\n\nI see the same behaviour in TypeScript so I don't think it's our bug (and is probably intended) but I thought it was worth clarifying. It's not what I'd expect (as a user). If there is no document highlighter registered this would be fine, but in this case I think extensions should have the say in what's highlighted. (I think Fat VS does what I'm asking for here?)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10469","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10469/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10469/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10469/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10469","id":170855030,"number":10469,"title":"Warning
