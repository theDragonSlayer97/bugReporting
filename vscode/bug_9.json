I don't know what the one has to do with the other, but it is reproducible: When I unplug the phone and replug it in, VSC opens. I've tried multiple USB ports, multiple phones. Not sure if this happens with IOS devices, I only have Android.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.16.1 (commit #27492b6bf3acb0775d82d2f87b25a93490673c6d)\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 17.04\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install vscode\r\n2. Plug your phone in via USB\r\n\r\nResult: A new VSC window pops up. This also happens if the phone is plugged in while the computer starts up, meaning every time I log in, VSC pops up.\r\n\r\nI am completely at a loss as to why this happens or why plugging a phone in and VSC opening are correlated.

The C# language service in VS has used this to build various experiences that they call \"preselection\": namely, the completion list comes up when the user types SPACE and a useful item is already selected. The canonical example of this is preselecting items after `new` in C#. `List<string>` is not normally present in the completion list, but gets specifically added preselected after the `new` keyword when the type of the expected expression is `List<string>` (or whatever).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3751401/31152402-c0bda37e-a850-11e7-8e02-558d21622d07.png)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if VS Code could add a similar feature (perhaps by adding a \"Preselect\" bit to to the CompletionItem class). If this API were available, we would definitely consume it from omnisharp-vscode.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35550","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35550/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35550/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35550/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35550","id":262613136,"number":35550,"title":"VSCode Insiders: Integrated terminal has a LANG=en_US.UTF-8 env variable declared","user":{"login":"Nazeehe","id":32499832,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/32499832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nazeehe","html_url":"https://github.com/Nazeehe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nazeehe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nazeehe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nazeehe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nazeehe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nazeehe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nazeehe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nazeehe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nazeehe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nazeehe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-10-03T22:40:15Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T17:05:51Z","closed_at":"2017-10-04T17:05:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

\"installed extensions\" pane is only sized to show two extensions (no matter how many extensions are installed).  It can be manually resized, but upon closing vscode and reopening it will be back to a height that only displays two extensions again.

I would think it should default to be sized to show all installed extensions, or at least be split half and half with the \"recommended extensions\" pane.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure vscode is completely closed\r\n2. Open vscode, navigate to the extensions pane, and notice there are only two installed extensions visible\r\n4. Manually resize the pane to show all installed extensions, and then close vscode\r\n5.
