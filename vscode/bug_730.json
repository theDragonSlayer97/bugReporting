But this is not necessarily the correct name to evaluate. This is wrong for C# for root items due to our type annotations, and it can be wrong for child items any time that '.' isn't the right way to combine elements together.\n### Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Install .NET Core, VS Code, and the C# extension (see http://aka.ms/vscclrdebugger for instruction)\n2. Create hello world with `dotnet new`\n3. Debug hello world and stop at the first line\n4. Look at the locals window\n5. Right click on `args` and invoke 'Add to Watch'\n\nResult:\nVS Code will add the name of the local (`args [string[]]`) which doesn't evaluate since we needed to add our type annotation.\n### Suggested fix\n\n`Variable` should have a new optional property for the evaluatable name. If that property is provided, Add to Watch should use this value instead. In VS, we call this value the 'full name'. For example, if `p` is a local pointer in C++, and `m_example` is a field, the full name for this would be `p->m_example`.\n\nSee https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/issues/73 for the corresponding protocol addition.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13876","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13876/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13876/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13876/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13876","id":183365850,"number":13876,"title":"Cannot debug mocha/es6 tests","user":{"login":"ales004","id":1430794,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1430794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ales004","html_url":"https://github.com/ales004","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ales004/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ales004/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ales004/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ales004/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ales004/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ales004/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ales004/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ales004/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ales004/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-10-17T09:23:12Z","updated_at":"2016-11-12T00:38:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.6.1\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
