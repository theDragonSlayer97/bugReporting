have a watch task that runs various per-file checks (lint, appropriate tests, etc). When it starts up, it runs those checks for all files in the project.  Thereafter, it only runs checks on files that change.\n\nFor the most part, it works great; but the one limitation I'm running into is that _all_ problems for a particular matcher are cleared on a run.\n\nFor example:\n1. I boot up the watch task, and there are problems on `foo.js` and `bar.js`.  The problem matcher picks up on all of these.\n2. I make a change to `foo.js`:\n   \n   a. The watch task re-runs checks for just `foo.js`.\n   b. The problem matcher notices that a re-run has occurred, and blows away all problems of that type\n   c. Only problems for `foo.js` are listed, even though `bar.js` still has issues.\n\nI'd like to avoid building a language server or plugin for this if I can (the watch task is very useful to non VS code users on the team; and problem matchers are wonderfully simple).\n\nOr maybe we could have an option for only clearing problems for files that have changed (or that match a particular

He said if the editor was smart enough to give a descriptive error message, then it should be smart enough to automatically use ES6.\n\nSo that brings me to the question. Why do we have to explicitly specify ES5/ES6 target? I am aware that WebStorm also requires you to set ES6 for the project, and I am aware that code completion etc is provided by a modern modular compiler, and being a compiler it needs to know what language version you want to work on. But I still wanted to know if you could comment further on this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1373","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1373/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1373/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1373/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1373","id":122475862,"number":1373,"title":"Jade
