VSCode Version: 1.11.0\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Set default shell to Git Bash or WSL (CTRL+SHIFT+P - \"shell\")\r\n2. Run a launch task using `${workspaceRoot}`\r\n\r\nHere's an example launch config:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"Debug All (node2)\",\r\n  \"type\": \"node2\",\r\n  \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n  \"protocol\": \"inspector\",\r\n  \"stopOnEntry\": false,\r\n  \"args\": [\r\n    \"--nolazy\",\r\n    \"${workspaceRoot}/debugall.js\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}/\",\r\n  \"preLaunchTask\": null,\r\n  \"runtimeExecutable\": null,\r\n  \"env\": {\r\n    \"NODE_ENV\": \"development\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"sourceMaps\": false,\r\n  \"outDir\": null,\r\n  \"console\": \"integratedTerminal\",\r\n  \"skipFiles\": [\r\n    \"<node_internals>/**\",\r\n    \"**/node_modules/**\"\r\n  ]\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning this with the Powershell terminal works just fine. When running in WSL or Git Bash, the `${workspaceRoot}` uses backslashes in the path and fails:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd c:\\dev\\projectname/ ; env NODE_ENV=development node --inspect=32931\r\n --debug-brk --nolazy c:\\dev\\projectname/debugall.js\r\nbash: cd: c:projectname/: No such file or directory\r\nDebugger listening on port 32931.\r\nWarning: This is an experimental feature and could change at any time.\r\nTo start debugging, open the following URL in Chrome:\r\n    chrome-devtools://devtools/remote/serve_file/@60cd6e859b9f557d2312f5bf532f6aec5f284980/inspector.html?experiments=true&v8only=true&ws=localhost:32931/afb2c\r\n73f-e645-4693-91bf-fc4b5a6364f8\r\nDebugger attached.\r\nmodule.js:471\r\n    throw err;\r\n    ^\r\n\r\nError: Cannot find module 'c:\\dev\\projectname\\devprojectname\\debugall.js'\r\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:469:15)\r\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:417:25)\r\n    at Timeout.Module.runMain [as _onTimeout] (module.js:604:10)\r\n    at ontimeout (timers.js:365:14)\r\n    at tryOnTimeout (timers.js:237:5)\r\n    at Timer.listOnTimeout (timers.js:207:5)\r\nWaiting for the debugger to disconnect...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that these commands will work in Git Bash if the backslashes are converted to the proper forward-slashes:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd c:\\dev\\projectname\r\nbash: cd: c:devprojectname: No such file or directory\r\n$ cd c:/dev/projectname\r\n[no error]\r\n$ node c:/dev/projectname/debugall.js\r\n[runs without error]\r\n```\r\n\r\nConverting the slashes doesn't fix WSL, though. In Git Bash the drives are mounted like `/c/` for `c:\\`. In WSL they're mounted at `/mnt/c/`, so it may require changing the drive part of `${workspaceRoot}` depending on the shell you have selected. We could hard-code the workspace root, but that forces everyone to use a *nix based shell and have the project in the same path on their different machines.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24072/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24071","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24071/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24071/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24071/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24071","id":219918553,"number":24071,"title":"sync VSCODE extensions, themes, short keys... in my all devices... windows, mac...","user":{"login":"farshadjahanmanesh","id":13612410,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13612410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/farshadjahanmanesh","html_url":"https://github.com/farshadjahanmanesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farshadjahanmanesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farshadjahanmanesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farshadjahanmanesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farshadjahanmanesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farshadjahanmanesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farshadjahanmanesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farshadjahanmanesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farshadjahanmanesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farshadjahanmanesh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-04-06T14:31:24Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T18:11:03Z","closed_at":"2017-04-06T18:10:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

In vscode 1.11 try to use a numpad key to navigate in a file (e.g. left/right/up/down arrows, Home, End, PgUp, PgDn)\r\n\r\nThe default keybindings don't recognize the numpad keyboard keys anymore in v1.11 (they worked fine until 1.10). For example, the `cursorEnd` command is bound to the `End` keybinding by default, but I need to add `NumPad1` manually in order for the numpad End key to work as well.\r\n\r\nI had to add these to `keybindings.json` in order to restore the old behavior:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n// Place your key bindings in this file to overwrite the defaults\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"key\": \"numpad7\",\r\n

\"editorTextFocus\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"key\": \"numpad8\",\r\n        \"command\": \"cursorUp\",\r\n        \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"key\": \"numpad2\",\r\n        \"command\": \"cursorDown\",\r\n        \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"key\": \"numpad4\",\r\n        \"command\": \"cursorLeft\",\r\n

Using a mac book pro with a french azerty keyboard (or at least using the French input source in osx keyboard settings I don't have a non french mac at hand to verify this)\r\n2. open a file with foldable sections\r\n3. try to fold a section with the default shortcuts. \r\n\r\nOn a French AZERTY mac keyboard, there is no `[` key. Typing a `[` requires one to press `⇧⌥(`. \r\n\r\nSince `⌥⌘[`(`alt+cmd+[`) is impossible to type, I tried :\r\n* `⌥⌘(` doesn't do anything\r\n*  `⌥⇧⌘(` doesn't do anything\r\n\r\nI then tried to edit the keybindings to add these combinations to editor.fold (and the matching ones for editor.unfold) but these functions are not available in the `keyboard shortcuts` editor.\r\n\r\nI had to define \r\n```\r\n    { \"key\": \"alt+cmd+5\",           \"command\": \"editor.fold\", \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\" },\r\n    { \"key\": \"alt+cmd+[Minus]\",           \"command\": \"editor.unfold\", \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\" }\r\n```\r\nin keybindings.json to get folding to work.\r\n\r\nI was able to find the right key combinations thanks to a combo of the blue information icon which tells me which keys I am supposed to press in my layout and the `⌘K ⌘K`feature to reverse match various key presses to the corresponding codes.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it seems the \"define keybinding\" ( `⌘K ⌘K` ) box is unable to find the right key combination to produce the default mapping's code. \r\n\r\nAccording to the box `⌥⌘^` is equivalent to `alt+cmd+[BracketLeft]` which sounds like the right code for `⌥⌘[` but event after I removed my overrides I was unable to get the folding to work pressing `⌥⌘^` and `⌥⌘$`\r\n\r\nSince the editor is already capable of translating  keypresses into the corresponding keycodes, it would be very very useful if there was a way to get with all the existing shortcut expressed in the current user's layout. \r\nIt would also be great if the default keymap included a working shortcut for fold/unfold on non qwerty keyboards.\r\n\r\n![img_20170406_144928](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22979/24755211/983ecc2a-1ad9-11e7-9c93-a902539d70df.jpg)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24053","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24053/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24053/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24053/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/24053","id":219894277,"number":24053,"title":"Hot
