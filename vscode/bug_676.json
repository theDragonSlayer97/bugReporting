Continuation of #12163\r\n\r\n#14048 is a MVP that provides just enough functionalities for implementing a DB explorer. We decided to start minimal and evolve the API accordingly to feedback.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of functionalities / questions that we should think about for future iterations.\r\n\r\n### Functionalities\r\n\r\n- Extension-initiated refresh (call `resolveChildren` again on a particular item)\r\n- Extension-initiated update to tree items (`label`, etc)\r\n- Icon (svg or png? should we allow remote icons? how this go with theming?)\r\n- Badge on Activity Bar\r\n- Reveal / Focus a tree item\r\n- Customized right click / context-menu\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n- `contributes.explorer` currently only allows one explorer per extension. Should we allow multiple explorers per extension? Or should we allow more complex Viewlet contributions, such as multi-section Viewlets?\r\n- Should there be an user-defined, workspace config for which explorers to enable? (Would also solve the problem of ordering. Currently custom Viewlets are ordered by enabling sequences, and it's not easy to rearrange them if you have many Viewlets)\r\n- Should we add activation event for Viewlets, like a `onLanguage:python` Viewlet that only shows its icon if the language is Python?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\n### Functionalities\r\n\r\n- Contributable top bar (we only have refresh by default)\r\n  \r\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4033249/20405375/991e6c70-acbd-11e6-9f85-ac20261c009c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15485/reactions","total_count":17,"+1":13,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":3}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15484","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15484/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15484/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15484/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15484","id":189256646,"number":15484,"title":"Build electron during npm install to solve issues with Cent OS","user":{"login":"rwhenderson","id":22511047,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/22511047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhenderson","html_url":"https://github.com/rwhenderson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhenderson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhenderson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhenderson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhenderson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhenderson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhenderson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhenderson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhenderson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhenderson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-11-14T23:30:44Z","updated_at":"2017-05-18T19:46:53Z","closed_at":"2017-05-16T07:17:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 7.1.0\r\n- OS Version: CentOS 6.7\r\n\r\nvscode install uses pre-built electron; should be built natively, otherwise you're stuck with un-resolvable GLIBC version dependencies on some OSs.
