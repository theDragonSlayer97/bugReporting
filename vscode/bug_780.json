However, like all UI trends, apps that don't quite keep up end up feeling old-fashioned 👯 \n\nI started a fork of VS Code that uses the inline style:\n\n![screen shot 2016-09-21 at 12 59 09](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/18710082/332cefb6-7ffb-11e6-8303-338bee1d6c35.png)\n\nThere needed to be a few changes:\n- I moved the sidebar width to 76, to fit the traffic lights\n- I increased the height of the elements that act as the titlebar by one pixel, mainly so that they align with the centre position of the titlebar items\n- Allow mouse dragging via the sidebar, and the title elements\n\nFork: https://github.com/orta/vscode/tree/inline-titlebar\nChanges: https://github.com/orta/vscode/compare/master...mac-titlebar-inline\n\nI realise that VS Code is a cross-platform project, and so these changes should _probably_ only be applied in the context of macOS, which I'm happy to look into with some advice (I don't have a windows/linux machine to hand for example).  \n\nI also know that no-one wants big unexpected UI changes on their OSS projects, so I've not made it as a PR, but I'd love to know if/what I can do to move this upstream?\n\n_Sidenote:_ If someone can tell me how, I'm happy to make a downloadable build for people to try too, I couldn't find a way to do it - I'm still quite fresh to npm projects.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12377/reactions","total_count":113,"+1":69,"-1":1,"laugh":7,"hooray":13,"confused":0,"heart":23}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12376","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12376/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12376/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12376/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12376","id":178318641,"number":12376,"title":"Intellisense","user":{"login":"ovidius72","id":3592928,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3592928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovidius72","html_url":"https://github.com/ovidius72","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovidius72/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovidius72/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovidius72/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovidius72/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovidius72/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovidius72/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovidius72/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovidius72/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovidius72/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-09-21T11:23:50Z","updated_at":"2017-02-02T08:24:22Z","closed_at":"2017-02-02T08:24:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.5.2\n- OS Version: OS X 10.11.6\n\nI'm trying to switch to vscode from another IDE.\nI was wondering if it is possible to have an intellisense that do this:\n\nif I have a variable called myVariable I would like to have it suggested if i enter just a few letters..

Ctrl+Shift+F to open find in files\n2. Switch to regex mode\n3. Enter a regex with a newline or lookbehind, there maybe others but these are the only ones I have encountered\n4. Hit enter.\n\nDepending on the regex you will either get a handful of results or non at all.

occurrences.\n\nCheers\n\nColin\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12370","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12370/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12370/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12370/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12370","id":178309432,"number":12370,"title":"Linux:

In another file, try the following two ways of importing identifiers:\n\n``` Typescript\nimport { MyClass } from 'myModule';\nMyClass // When hovering MyClass, the written doc is not visible.\n```\n\n``` Typescript\nimport * as myModule from 'myModule';\nmyModule.MyClass // When hovering MyClass, the written doc appears.\n```\n\nIt seems logical that the doc should appear in both cases, is this due to Typescript 2?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12359","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12359/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12359/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12359/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12359","id":178261095,"number":12359,"title":"Format code does not work for javascript code","user":{"login":"galpeti","id":2624797,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2624797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/galpeti","html_url":"https://github.com/galpeti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galpeti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galpeti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galpeti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galpeti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galpeti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galpeti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galpeti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galpeti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galpeti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":293379998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/languages%20basic","name":"languages basic","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":291057332,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/verified","name":"verified","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2016-09-21T06:48:21Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T17:43:31Z","closed_at":"2016-10-24T22:02:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.5.2\n- OS Version: wWn 10 \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
