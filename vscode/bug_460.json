Install the latest version of VSCode (v1.10.0 or higher)\r\n2. Examine the window titlebar, and note that its appearance and functionality are a custom implementation rather than the macOS standard titlebar\r\n\r\nI would appreciate a setting to use the macOS standard titlebar for a few reasons:\r\n1. The [titlebar proxy icon](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2010031117415674) is a powerful macOS standard feature that VSCode's custom titlebar doesn't support\r\n2. The macOS standard titlebar right-click offers a better interface (with icons) than the duplicate functionality implemented by VSCode's custom titlebar\r\n3. Some applications such as [HyperDock](https://bahoom.com/hyperdock/) add system-wide functionality to window titlebars (in this case, scrolling on them to maximize the window), which doesn't work with VSCode's custom titlebar\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21984","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21984/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21984/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21984/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21984","id":211904003,"number":21984,"title":"expose an ability (for extensions) to color some code pieces","user":{"login":"amigo421","id":3259933,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3259933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amigo421","html_url":"https://github.com/amigo421","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amigo421/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amigo421/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amigo421/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amigo421/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amigo421/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amigo421/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amigo421/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amigo421/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amigo421/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-03-04T20:14:33Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T09:55:47Z","closed_at":"2017-03-07T08:58:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:1.10.1\r\n- OS Version:Win10/x64\r\n\r\nfeature request.\r\n\r\nI'm using the editor for C++ development, so the case when some code pieces are inactive due the language features (simple example is preprocessor definitions).

not sure how to reproduce this; if I manage to do it again, I'll update the issue. \r\nI was seeing high (~97-100%) CPU usage from this `Code Helper.app` process running `tsserver.js`:\r\n```\r\n/Users/jskrzypek/Downloads/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Frameworks/Code Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/Code Helper /Users/jskrzypek/Downloads/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/extensions/typescript/out/utils/electronForkStart /usr/local/lib/node_modules/typescript/lib/tsserver.js --useSingleInferredProject --enableTelemetry\r\n```\r\nI noticed that both this process and another Code Helper running `typescript`\r\n```\r\n/Users/jskrzypek/Downloads/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Frameworks/Code Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/Code Helper /Users/jskrzypek/.nvm/versions/node/v6.9.5/lib/node_modules/typescript/lib/typingsInstaller.js --globalTypingsCacheLocation /Users/jskrzypek/Library/Caches/typescript --enableTelemetry\r\n```\r\nstuck around after quitting vscode. I googled for an issue and found #20260 which had an instruction to try using the `TSS_LOG` shell parameter to enable tsserver logging. I \"force quit\" the misbehaving `tsserver.js` activity from the Activity Monitor and then followed the instructions in the comment https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20260#issuecomment-282408109 and ran this:\r\n```\r\nexport TSS_LOG=\"-level verbose -file ~/tss.log\"\r\ncode .\r\n```\r\nAfter vscode opened, I got a warning at the top of the window informing me that the typescript service had died repeatedly more than 5 times in the last 5 minutes. This warning modal kept appearing repeatedly, leading me to believe that whatever was triggering the warning kept occurring. I clicked on the button to create the issue and then quit vscode. When I looked, the `tts.log` file did not  exist. After running `code .` a second time the warning did not appear.\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n\r\nIt noticed that I also have a Sublime Text node process running `tsserver.js` hanging around long after I've quit ST that is also showing high cpu use. I was running bot ST and vscode simultaneously at some point recently, I think on the same project/folder.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21972/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21971","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21971/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21971/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21971/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21971","id":211870302,"number":21971,"title":"Output window does not respect codepage","user":{"login":"vsobotka","id":4008662,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4008662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsobotka","html_url":"https://github.com/vsobotka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsobotka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsobotka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsobotka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsobotka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsobotka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsobotka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsobotka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsobotka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsobotka/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-04T10:10:20Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T14:36:54Z","closed_at":"2017-03-06T14:36:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
