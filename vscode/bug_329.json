It just seems wrong to me and I found it much nicer before. With 1.12.0 the sync icon spins again, but now removing the ahead/behind counts immediately feels weird as the spinning sync operation \"works\" on pushing/pulling those two things and only when it's done spinning the counts should disappear as well. I hereby vote for reverting that change, especially since now the icon is spinning again.
