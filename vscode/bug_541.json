I was not able to get Jest to debug properly to work on my primary laptop and, after several hours of mucking with it, I tried my second laptop. It worked! After comparing differences, I noticed npm was way out of date and ultimately I discovered the hack below. I feel this is an issue the Jest team must address (and I'll be submitting a issue with them) but I was hoping your team might have some insight? At the very least, others having this issue might find this useful.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Clone my [debug-jest-in-vscode](https://github.com/jbsulli/debug-jest-in-vscode) repo. It's simply the [getting started](http://facebook.github.io/jest/index.html#getting-started) example from Jest but with my VSCode launch config.\r\n2. Use `npm install`, put a breakpoint on `__tests__/sum-test.js:2`, and run.\r\n\r\nWhat I see is, even though I have the `sum-test.js` page open, a new tab labeled `c:\\github\\debug-jest-in-vscode\\__tests__\\sum-test.js` is opened (note: I cloned to `C:\\github\\debug-jest-in-vscode`). If you hover over the tab, the full path it shows is `\\1000\\c:\\github\\debug-jest-in-vscode\\__tests__\\sum-test.js`. Also, my code is wrapped with `({\"Object.<anonymous>\":function(module,exports,require,__dirname,__filename,global,jest){` + `}});`. The breakpoint is still respected and the program stops in the correct spot; however, neither placing new breakpoints nor editing code in the mystery tab seems to work.\r\n\r\nNow, to get it to work:\r\n\r\n1. Delete the `node_modules` folder entirely.\r\n2. Use `npm install --legacy-bundling`, put a breakpoint on `__tests__/sum-test.js:2`, and run.\r\n\r\nNow everything is peachy and runs and behaves as expected.
