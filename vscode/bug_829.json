VSCode Version: 1.5.0-insider\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nI'm trying to create a language extension for [ecmarkup](https://github.com/bterlson/ecmarkup), which uses the `.html` file extension. I don't want my language to completely override the existing HTML syntax, just ones with a `<!doctype ecmarkup>` first line. \n\nHowever, https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2883, plus the general way languages are matched makes this impossible. If I add `\".html\"` to the `\"extensions\"` entry for my language, I end up overriding all HTML files, but if I only add a `\"firstLine\"` match for something like `\"^<!doctype\\\\s+ecmarkup\\\\b\"`, the HTML syntax is used instead.\n\nWhat I feel I really need is a more specific set of file matching rules, something like:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"id\": \"ecmarkup\",\n  \"aliases\": [\"ecmarkup\", \"emu\"],\n  \"rules\": [\n    { \"extensions\": [\".html\"], \"firstLine\": \"^<!(doctype|DOCTYPE)\\\\s+ecmarkup\\b\" }\n  ],\n  \"configuration\": \"./ecmarkup.configuration.json\"\n}\n```\n## Proposal\n\nWith more specific rules, I can specify multiple requirements for a specific match, where precedence is based on the combined weight of each of the requirements.\n\nEffectively, each of the `\"filenames\"`, `\"filenamePatterns\"`, `\"mimeTypes\"`, `\"extensions\"`, and `\"firstLine\"` patterns would internally be transposed into the `\"rules\"` collection as:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"rules\": [\n    { \"filenames\": [] },\n    { \"filenamePatterns\": [] },\n    { \"mimeTypes\": [] },\n    { \"extensions\": [] },\n    { \"firstLine\": \"\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe following is an example of the proposed interface for these rules (borrowed from the types defined in [modeService.ts](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/editor/common/services/modeService.ts)):\n\n``` ts\nexport interface ILanguageServiceExtensionPoint {\n    id: string;\n    extensions?: string[];\n    filenames?: string[];\n    filenamePatterns?: string[];\n    firstLine?: string;\n    aliases?: string[];\n    mimetypes?: string[];\n    configuration?: string;\n    rules?: ILanguageServiceExtensionPointRule[];\n}\nexport interface ILanguageServiceExtensionPointRule {\n    filenames?: string[];\n    filenamePatterns?: string[];\n    extensions?: string[];\n    firstLine?: string;\n    ignore?: boolean; // If this rule is matched, *do not* use this extension\n}\nexport interface IValidLanguageExtensionPoint {\n    id: string;\n    aliases: string[];\n    mimetypes: string[];\n    configuration: string;\n    rules: IVerifiedLanguageServiceExtensionPointRule[];\n}\nexport interface IVerifiedLanguageServiceExtensionPointRule {\n    filenames: string[];\n    filenamePatterns: string[];\n    extensions: string[];\n    firstLine: string;\n    ignore: boolean; // If this rule is matched, *do not* use this extension\n}\n```\n\nThe approximate weights for each match would be something like:\n\n``` ts\nconst enum TextMimeAssociationWeights {\n  UserConfiguredMime = 1 << 4, // highest priority\n  Filenames = 1 << 3,\n  FilenamePatterns = 1 << 2,\n  Extensions = 1 << 1,\n  FirstLine = 1 << 0, // lowest priority\n}\n```\n\nGiven how first-line matches are treated in [mime.ts](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/base/common/mime.ts), a user-configured rule that contains only `\"firstLine\"` would not have the `UserConfiguredMime` flag added.\n\nThe following illustrates this weighting scheme:\n\n| User | Rule | Weight |\n| --- | --- | --: |\n| yes | `{ \"extensions\": [\".html\"], \"firstLine\": \"^<!doctype custom\" }` | 21 |\n| no | `{ \"extensions\": [\".html\"] }` | 2 |\n| yes | `{ \"firstLine\": \"^#!/usr/bin/env node\" }` | 1 |\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10915/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10914","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10914/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10914/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10914/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10914","id":173054869,"number":10914,"title":"[Missing

Assume the following code:\n\n``` dart\nmyFunc() {\n  myFun(); // <-- Typo\n}\n```\n\nI get a code fix here that says \"change `myFun()` to `myFunc()`\" and provides an edit which inserts a `c` at the correct position.\n\nIf I click the lightbulb and apply it, everything is fine; the change is applied, the menu closes.\n\nHowever, if I hit `F8` and click the link in the popup:\n\n![Code action](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1078012/17945949/fc2471d8-6a3d-11e6-9b03-2b1f97230121.png)\n\nThe edit is applied (I'm doing this via `workspace.applyEdit()` in a command) but the link remains on the screen. This means you can click it a second time and it inserts a second `c` (and a third...).\n\nNow, I could keep track of this by mutating the source edit object and refusing to apply it a second time;

Reproduce:\n1. clone [this repo](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) (no need to `npm install`). bug happens in my project and others as well (all `JavaScript/Node` projects), but using this repo makes replication easier.\n2. open the folder in `VS Code`\n3. open `.babelrc` in a tab\n4. open `package.json` in another tab\n5. delete a line from the `dependencies` prop in `package.json`\n6. `ctrl+s` (or whatever on a mac)\n\n**you should observe some flickering in a number of places in the UI**\n1. close `package.json` tab, confirm `save` in the ensuing dialogue\n\n**the tab should close, but the text of `package.json` should paste-over the text in your other open file, ie, `babelrc`**\n\nThis behavior also happens often when editing VS Code `settings` JSONs. \n\n**my settings**: \n\n```\n$ code

I'm working on a set of files on a network drive. I move my laptop to a different location, or switch from wired to wireless. The network drive disconnects. Now, I lose all the files I was working on and have to re-open them all. \n\nAnother example...  I'm working on 10+ files at the end of the day and I close my laptop and go home. The next morning I come in, and I have to re-open all 10 of those files (assuming I remember what they were).\n\nCorrect behavior should be to keep the file open.  Of course, you can't save it until you reconnect the network drives, but at least it is there.  This is how Sublime works.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10889","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10889/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10889/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10889/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10889","id":172934673,"number":10889,"title":"\"Check For Updates\" Missing on OS X","user":{"login":"jtsom","id":13488,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom","html_url":"https://github.com/jtsom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-24T12:08:30Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T18:15:58Z","closed_at":"2016-08-24T18:15:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.5.0-insider (c4f365235906cd689e55376e44cc106003ac06b3, 2016-08-24T06:04:42.373Z)\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 15.6.0\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: Mac OS X 10.11.6\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open/create a document containing a line with multiple characters except `{`\n   1. alternatively, just fill the line with a bunch of `a`s\n2. Search for `^[^{]`. The first character of the matching line is selected, as expected, with the find box stating something like \"1 of 338\"\n   1. or `^a`, if you went with 1.i\n3. Find next. Instead of going to the next matching line, the next character on the current line is selected, with the find box stating \"? of 338\"\n4. Find previous works as expected\n\nIt seems as if the search is run on the substring starting after the current match; but the beginning of this substring is erroneously interpreted as \"start of line\".\n\nA symmetric issue occurs with `a$` and find previous.\n\nFor the moment, my workaround is searching for `^[^{].*$`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4533","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"E53D:4298:2EF102:6B630D:59D941FA","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=830>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=828>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"5d8280d9504b68ba8939419c43ff4c65\"","status":"200 OK"}}
