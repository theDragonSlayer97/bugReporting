Use this program test.js:\r\n  ```js\r\n  let i = 0;\r\n  setInterval(() => {\r\n\tconsole.log('hello: ' + i++);\r\n  }, 1000);\r\n  ```\r\n- download current Electron, e.g. on macOS https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/download/v1.4.15/electron-v1.4.15-darwin-x64.zip \r\n- run from command line with `./Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron --debug=6009 test.js`\r\n- attach VS Code with this config:\r\n  ```json\r\n  {\r\n\t\"type\": \"node\",\r\n\t\"request\": \"attach\",\r\n\t\"name\": \"Attach to Process\",\r\n\t\"address\": \"localhost\",\r\n\t\"port\": 6009,\r\n\t\"protocol\": \"legacy\"\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nObserve: a debug session starts and if you set a breakpoint the program will stop and hit the breakpoint. \r\n\r\n- stop session\r\n- change `protocol` to `auto`\r\n- attach VS Code again\r\n\r\nObserve: a message \"Debugging with legacy protocol because Node version could not be determined.\" shows up in the debug console but no debug session starts.\r\n\r\nTurning on tracing sends this to the debug console:\r\n```json\r\nDebugging with legacy protocol because Node version could not be determined.\r\n62796: _attach: address: 127.0.0.1 port: 6009\r\n62796: _attach: connected\r\n62796: _terminated: socket end\r\n62796: _terminated: node v8protocol close\r\n62796: _terminated: socket error\r\n62796: _terminated: node v8protocol error\r\n62796: _terminated: node v8protocol error\r\n62796: disconnectRequest: send response\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it looks like that the probing leaves the debug port in a strange state which prevents node-debug from connecting to that port successfully. \r\n\r\nWhen using 'node' instead of 'Electron', VS Code attaches successfully.\r\n\r\nTrace output in this case:\r\n```json\r\nDebugging

It is as if VS Code made attempts to connect via ssh autonomously and repeatedly when it is opened or when I type the ssh command.
