has worked in the past but no longer works.\r\n\r\nHere are the steps to reproduce the setup:\r\n- `git clone git@github.com:Microsoft/vscode-tslint.git`\r\n- open a Code instance on both the folder `tslint` and `tslint-server` \r\n- run `npm install` in both the `tslint` and the `tslint-server` folder\r\n- **new** in the `tslint-server` run `npm run compile`\r\n- in  `tslint-server` open `src/server.ts` and set a breakpoint in `#doValidate`\r\n- in `tslint` press F5 to start a debug session\r\n- in the extension development host open the folder `vscode-tslint/tslint-test` and then the file `arrow-parens.ts` see the screenshot below for the setup.\r\n- you will see a tslint warning/green squiggle on line 1. This shows that the tslint-server is running\r\n- switch to the `tslint-server` window and press F5 to attach to the server. Attaching to the server is successful. \r\n- switch to the extension development host and make an edit in `arrow-parens.ts`. This should trigger `doValidate` in the server and hit the break point.\r\n\r\n=> the break point is not hit.\r\n\r\nWhen I replace the breakpoint with a `debugger;` statement and recompile the server, then the debugger stops as expected. This shows that attaching to the server process is successful.\r\n\r\nSo I suspect an issue with source maps or the way the launch is configured for the server.\r\nThis is the launch.json for the server:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n\t// List of configurations. Add new configurations or edit existing ones.\r\n\t\"configurations\": [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"Attach\",\r\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"node\",\r\n\t\t\t\"request\": \"attach\",\r\n\t\t\t// TCP/IP address. Default is \"localhost\".\r\n\t\t\t\"address\": \"localhost\",\r\n\t\t\t// Port to attach to.\r\n\t\t\t\"port\": 6004,\r\n\t\t\t\"sourceMaps\": true,\r\n\t\t\t\"outDir\": \"${workspaceRoot}/../tslint/server\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that as part of the build process the *.js files and the source maps from the server folder are copied into the `vscode-tslint/tslint/server` folder. \r\n\r\nThe path to the sources in the sourcemap `server.js.map` looks OK:\r\n```json\r\n{\"version\":3,\"file\":\"server.js\",\"sourceRoot\":\"\",\"sources\":[\"../../tslint-server/src/server.ts\"],\r\n```\r\n\r\n// CC @dbaeumer \r\n\r\n## Test setup\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/172399/20667303/d93e501e-b568-11e6-8421-a67cd9c5e0b2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16143/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16142","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16142/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16142/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16142/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16142","id":191984416,"number":16142,"title":"Freezes when select some lines in a HTML file","user":{"login":"patrickmaciel","id":671670,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/671670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmaciel","html_url":"https://github.com/patrickmaciel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmaciel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmaciel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmaciel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmaciel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmaciel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmaciel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmaciel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmaciel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrickmaciel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":409283388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/caused-by-extension","name":"caused-by-extension","color":"E2A1C2","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-11-28T11:40:30Z","updated_at":"2017-03-30T10:01:38Z","closed_at":"2017-03-30T10:01:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.7.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 x64 Build 1607\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

VSCode Version: 1.7.2\r\n- OS Version: Linux, Windows.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Disable Telemetry.\r\n\r\nI have disabled telemetry as described in the [FAQ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting). I have set the following properties in the settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"telemetry.enableCrashReporter\": false,\r\n\"telemetry.enableTelemetry\": false\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow despite of this, when I log my network traffic (with Wireshark) I can see that Visual Studio Code periodically contacts vortex.data.microsoft.com. This is a known server used for telemetry purposes. I have opted out of the telemetry and information is still sent, why? What information is exchanged? \r\n\r\nThe FAQ describes:\r\n> If you don’t wish to send usage data to Microsoft, you can set the telemetry.enableTelemetry setting to false.\r\n\r\nTo me this means that no telemetry connections should be made, because I would assume that continuous connections to the server can still easily be used to collect information for product usage tracking even if no actual private data is being collected by the application itself.
