some strange merge issues when trying to keep the repo up to date, and GitHub Desktop started acting funny after OS upgrade, so sorry for the noise in the last couple of commits as I sorted it out.\n\nIncluded in this PR:\n\nFirst part of modernising css.plist:\n- Big update of CSS properties. Should now include most valid CSS properties.\n- Add missing pseudo elements/classes: fullscreen, placeholder and the input pseudo classes\n- Add missing CSS units\n- Add speech media type\n- Fix comments about colours to point to spec and not incorrect info about being non-standard from W3Schools\n\nBig update to css-scheme.xml for CSS intellisense and generate new JSON file:\n- Add Edge browser support info. Mostly complete except some pseudo classes/elements.\n- Update other browser support to be as close as possible to reality. Some still need to be checked\n- Update specs where appropriate\n- Remove old properties and values that no longer exist\n- Add new CSS properties from almost all CSS specs except old unmaintained spec and a couple of others: CSS Logical Properties and Round Display. SVG CSS properties also still need checking and updating. Especially for browser support.\n- Updated some of the descriptions to be more concise and consistent, and add some missing ones\n- Update at-rules: @keyframes and @supports
