response to Erich Gamma's tweet](https://twitter.com/ErichGamma/status/755437588291485697) @Krzysztof-Cieslak\n\nA test runner viewlet/sidebar with a pluggable API would be a great addition to vscode. \n\nThe viewlet should include visual indications of \n- the progress of completed tests out of the set of tests being run\n- visual indicators or icons showing basic tests states at the least \n  `not run |  success | failure | ignored/skipped`\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/Rt4uw9S.png)\n\nThe test runner should be able to provide a set of sorting categories and repopulate the viewlet based on the users selection\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/MhP5Elk.png)\n\nA query box with the ability to filter the tests based on the names shown in the runner's list at a minimum, with the ability for the underlying runner to populate a set of query filters.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/062i5zz.png)\n\nInstead of the VS style of collapsing categories\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/GivhUBv.png)\n\nI think the vscode style used in the debugger viewlet is much nicer :smile: \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/iOFmimd.png)\n\nA button could be used to select which test runner you want to use out of the test runner extensions that have been installed\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7P5ljMa.png)\n\nBut a dropdown menu would work too\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/KA1fG2r.png)\n\nA side button to open a menu could enable the active test runner to populate it with any additional commands specific to its functionality \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/QDh2Wu3.png)\n\nSome other functionality points -\n- When an individual test is selected the result could be rendered in the output panel\n- An icon/button to run all tests\n- The ability to highlight/select a set of tests and only run those tests \n- A basic set of run options, which individual runners might be able to extend  \n  ![](http://i.imgur.com/BkYPZfB.png)\n- Tests outputs can contain links to specific points in source code\n- Debugging specific tests (would be awesome, but understandable if this is too difficult for an initial implementation)\n- Associate test runner extensions with specific languages?\n- Test playlists (would be nice, but not especially important)\n- Ability to specify a task/trigger that will repopulate the viewlet's list of tests\n- Dropdown menu that the test runner can population with platform/environment/runtime configurations to use during test execution.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9505/reactions","total_count":88,"+1":79,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":9}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9504","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9504/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9504/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9504/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9504","id":166432476,"number":9504,"title":"Autocomplete

VSCode Version: 1.3.1\n- OS Version: not likely relevant, but it's Windows 7\n\nI'm new to Visual Studio Code, so be gentle.  There is new behavior in VSCode (or at least I don't remember it in the past).  I don't know if it's part of the base VSCode, part of Microsoft's C/C++ extension that I installed, or some combination of both.  But the end effect is that when I'm typing in a comment (either // or /\\* */ style), the autocomplete popup decides to show itself when it sees text that it knows.  An example:\n1. Type \"// This isn't fun\"\n2. Autocomplete will now popup, offering to complete \"fun\".\n3. The word I wanted was indeed fun, so I type space.\n4. Autocomplete changes \"fun \" to \"function\" for me.\n5. Now I have to go back and edit it.\n\nSimilar things happen when I'm typing a period to end a sentence.  Autocomplete sees this as an opportunity to try to turn a simple period into a dereference to a member.\n\nThe issue is that while having autocomplete do this on code is exactly what I want, having it do this when I'm typing comments is exactly what I don't.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9504/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9503","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9503/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9503/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9503/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9503","id":166416488,"number":9503,"title":"Microsoft.PowerShell.EditorServices.Host.exe process constantly uses one CPU core","user":{"login":"ykuijs","id":15103891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15103891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykuijs","html_url":"https://github.com/ykuijs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykuijs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykuijs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykuijs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykuijs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykuijs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykuijs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykuijs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykuijs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykuijs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":409283388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/caused-by-extension","name":"caused-by-extension","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-07-19T19:40:54Z","updated_at":"2016-07-21T17:00:02Z","closed_at":"2016-07-21T17:00:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.3.1 (e6b4afa53e9c0f54edef1673de9001e9f0f547ae, 2016-07-12T13:35:06.227Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.10586\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
