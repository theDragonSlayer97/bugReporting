respective it highlighs from correct start char but to invalid end char (end char on wrtong line)\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n                 invalid end position: (line: 2, char: 14) - wrong line\r\n1: <ItemGroup>   ↓               ↓ correct start position (line: 2, char: 29)\r\n2:   <Reference I|nclude=\"SomeLib|\">\r\n3:     <Name>Some Lib</Name>\r\n4:     <HintPath> ..\\_output\\Client\\$(Configuration)\\SomeLib.dll</HintPath>\r\n5:     <Private>F alse</Private>\r\n6:   </Reference>| \r\n7: <ItemGroup>   ↑ correct end position (line: 6, char: 14)\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**expected result:** global search highlights same way as local one - at least in 'file window' (in search results 'tree' it cound show first line followed by tree dots if multiline output isnt possible here)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28512","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28512/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28512/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28512/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28512","id":235201452,"number":28512,"title":"Integrated Terminal limited to 80 characters upon first start and first instance","user":{"login":"vladeck","id":16443718,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16443718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladeck","html_url":"https://github.com/vladeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladeck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-06-12T11:23:50Z","updated_at":"2017-06-12T18:05:16Z","closed_at":"2017-06-12T18:04:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Basic info:**\r\n- VSCode Version: **1.13.0**\r\n- OS Version: **Windows 10 x64 1703 15063.332**\r\n- Monitor resolution: **2560x1440**, VSCode **maximized**\r\n\r\n**profile.ps1:**\r\n```\r\n$env:LC_ALL='C.UTF-8'\r\nImport-Module posh-git\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1.

It allows me to see the readable text and at the same time scroll to the middle or the end of the file very quickly *(not by one click, but by click and drag mouse that is more natural as for me)*.\r\n\r\nIf you will have any questions of help - let me know.\r\nAnton","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28510","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28510/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28510/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28510/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28510","id":235198158,"number":28510,"title":"Add Project Manager extension to VS Code","user":{"login":"1st","id":630224,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/630224?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st","html_url":"https://github.com/1st","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":535120898,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/multi-root","name":"multi-root","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2017-06-12T11:09:04Z","updated_at":"2017-06-13T22:13:48Z","closed_at":"2017-06-13T17:16:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think that Projects ideology should be in a heart of the VS Code. The main reason for it it that we can have a dedicated folder for each project where we can save project settings (including workspace settings), cache files (for example for file tree to make Go To File super fast and save cache between VS Code reloads), to save cache of external plugins (like such as Python, that saves and uses cache for Go To Symbol In workspace).\r\n\r\nPlease discuss this decision again in your core team.

Set git conflict style to `diff3`. In `~/.gitconfig`:\r\n```\r\n[merge]\r\n    conflictstyle = diff3\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. This results in merge conflict format as shown below. You can copy paste this into a blank tab:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<<<<<<< Updated upstream\r\nfoo\r\n||||||| merged common ancestors\r\nbar\r\n=======\r\nbaz\r\n>>>>>>> Stashed changes\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.

are looking into adding debug API to our vscode.d.ts. In order to design this as best as possible let's first look at the use cases and the current use of commands.\r\n\r\n### Use Cases\r\n\r\n* Debug session end event https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28234\r\n* Node internal modules navigator\r\n\r\n### Commands\r\n\r\nExtension --> VS Code\r\n* `vscode.startDebug` - extension can start a debug session by calling this command\r\n* `customDebugRequest` - extension can send any DAP request to the currently active debug adapter\r\n* `debug.logToDebugConsole` - extension can log a string to the debug console\r\n\r\nVS Code --> Extension\r\n* `startSessionCommand` - if contributed vscode calls this command instead of starting a debug session on its own\r\n* `initialConfigurations` - if contributed vscode calls this command to get the initial content of the `launch.json`\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nMinimal API proposal by @weinand and me. If `name` and `type` should be a part of `DebugSession` is very coraleted to the question @weinand raises below.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport namespace debug {\r\n  export const onDidEndDebugSession: Event<DebugSession>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport interface DebugSession {\r\n   readonly name: string;\r\n   readonly type: string;\r\n   customRequest(requestName: string, args: any): Thenable<DebugRequestResult>;\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28499","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28499/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28499/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28499/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28499","id":235169480,"number":28499,"title":"Add \"always_show_minimap_viewport\" option to always highlight visible area","user":{"login":"paulklemm","id":2169489,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2169489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulklemm","html_url":"https://github.com/paulklemm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulklemm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulklemm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulklemm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulklemm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulklemm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulklemm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulklemm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulklemm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulklemm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-12T09:15:36Z","updated_at":"2017-06-13T09:32:16Z","closed_at":"2017-06-13T09:31:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sublime Text knows the `always_show_minimap_viewport` setting for the minimap:\r\n\r\n*If `true`, shows a rectangle on the minimap highlighting the file’s visible area.
