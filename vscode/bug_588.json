However if it adds selections that differ in case, then I cannot type a replacement that matches the various cases.  For instance, if `[ ... ]` represents the selection here:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst [table] = new Table();\r\n// Tables have sizes:\r\nconst tableSize = table.size();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I'd like to quickly change the three lowercase \"table\"s to \"newTable\", without changing the two capitalized \"Table\"s.  There isn't much value to me in selecting the capitalized ones, because the replacement I type will end up being the wrong case for one or the other.  So I'd like to quickly reach the following selection:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n const [table] = new Table();\r\n // Tables have sizes:\r\n const [table]Size = [table].size();\r\n```\r\n\r\nExisting alternatives: The 'editor.action.moveSelectionToNextFindMatch' (_ctrl+k ctrl+d_) can be used to skip the unwanted regions, though that requires more keystrokes.  The following also works: \"editor.action.startFindReplaceAction\" (_ctrl+h_) - \"toggleFindCaseSensitive\" (_alt+c_)- type replacement - and _ENTER_ a few times, though that approach doesn't leave multiple cursors in place.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18135","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18135/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18135/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18135/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/18135","id":198850881,"number":18135,"title":"Use
