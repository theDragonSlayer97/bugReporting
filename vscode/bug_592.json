My Example: [sgtoj/dynamo-localdb](https://github.com/sgtoj/dynamo-localdb)\r\n     - Script: `./scripts/test.js`\r\n- Set debug point on couple random lines using the F9 key.\r\n- Enter debug mode.\r\n  - Normally, the breakpoints will randomly move around.\r\n- Set more debug point on other lines.\r\n   - Normally, the setting a new breakpoint affects the other existing points.\r\n\r\n##### Issues\r\n- Breakpoint set via F9 key randomly move once debug is executed.\r\n  - Normally, but not always, it will move down a line.\r\n  - Somes times, breakpoints are removed altogether. \r\n- While debug mode is active, VS Code or Node-Debug doesn't respect the line number a new breakpoint (via F9) was set. \r\n- While debug mode is active, existing breakpoints will randomly move around when another breakpoint (via F9) is added.\r\n\r\nBreakpoints Set via F9 -

A simple patch that \"fixes\" the issue is in attach. \r\nIt's not so much because OSX has the close button on the left, but more because it's inefficient to have to move the mouse to close two tabs in a sequence. Think of chrome. It does it very well. When you close a tab, before resizing the tabs, the tab on the right will end up with its close button on the same location as the closed tab - that is, right under the mouse. This can be accomplished without resizing the tabs by placing it on the left. It even matches the OSX button placement. For me the patch works, but I would prefer to still get automatic updates without having to reapply it. I don't know if this can be applied as an extension - didn't research it. If yes, do let me know. I'll implement it.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"code\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6506378/21593127/41c6ea1a-d157-11e6-8532-92114482ae02.png\">\r\n[Code.patch.txt](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/681142/Code.patch.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18012","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18012/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18012/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18012/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18012","id":198354098,"number":18012,"title":"Multiple background gradations","user":{"login":"andi1984","id":1077917,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1077917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi1984","html_url":"https://github.com/andi1984","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi1984/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi1984/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi1984/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi1984/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi1984/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi1984/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi1984/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi1984/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi1984/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-02T16:05:48Z","updated_at":"2017-01-02T17:09:21Z","closed_at":"2017-01-02T17:09:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nI've the issue that my editor consists of multiple background gradations of different sizes (see screenshot at the end).
