new to VSCode, i like many things in this editor, but i miss a lot of really useful and important options which missing for some reasons at Visual Code. One of such feature is Powerful Search Options.\r\n\r\nAbout what i'm talking about?\r\n![](https://vgy.me/jrMtL5.png)\r\n\r\n### What will you see on image above?\r\n\r\n1. Multiline Search which will search in opened document for the text. Also, this feature support searching for multiple lines at once in multiple documents very easy.\r\n2. Multiline Search when you enter in search fild your lines automatically find in text this text (if it exist) and highlite it\r\n3. You can manipulate with multiline search the same like with one-line search.\r\n4. You can select multiple lines via ALT + SHIFT + Arrow Up / Arrow Down multiple lines, then you can click HOME button and all lines will be selected with multiple cursor and you can apply some changes to your multiline search like below:\r\n\r\n![Multiline Searching And Line Manipulation in search field](https://vgy.me/Nmf3Ym.gif)\r\n\r\n### Why multiline feature like in sublime text should be implemented?\r\nBecause of this feature, time saved in 10-20x times. People like me who working with a lot of patches, reject hunks, etc things and working with a lot of searching things will find this features very useful. Example of usage can be: fixing `.rej` files, applying patches, big diffs, applying some changes to multiple lines at once.\r\n\r\nPlease think about it well, this feature is market-killer, and in one day even if you reject the issue today, community will request this feature for sure, no exeptions, just time will show. Because this feature minimize stupid tasks and time for doing the same job, productivty increased, all happy.\r\n\r\nMore info about feature: http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/search_and_replace/search_and_replace.html","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15727/reactions","total_count":48,"+1":48,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15726","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15726/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15726/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15726/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15726","id":190316057,"number":15726,"title":"Event Loop: Socket callback being ignored","user":{"login":"mbana","id":22658,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/22658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbana","html_url":"https://github.com/mbana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-11-18T13:11:47Z","updated_at":"2016-11-20T00:27:47Z","closed_at":"2016-11-20T00:27:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I guess this is might be an Electron isusue, not sure.\r\nAny thoughts much appreciated.\r\n\r\nMy setup is:\r\n\r\n* VSCode extension that setups a [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) connection.\r\n* I've added callbacks to the various events.\r\n* I almost sure I am getting some timing related issue as when I am debugging, the socket connection is established.\r\n\r\n**Misc:**\r\n\r\n* I've got the exact same code, with matching deps, running as standalone nodejs app and it doesn't exhibit the same behaviour.\r\n* I've tried two WebSocket implementations in nodejs and they both do *funny* things when run in VSCode; non-sensical errors. Yet, in pure nodejs they work fine. I am going to try one more just incase.\r\n\r\n**Qs:**\r\n\r\n1 - Is it possible to get debugging support to be on par with Chrome? E.g., in an extension that makes http requests, it would be nice to somehow see those requests.\r\n\r\n 2 - How do I set env. variables in the `launch.json` of `extensionHost? I have to manually export before launching `code` at the moment - second shell script.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"name\": \"Launch Extension\",\r\n\"type\": \"extensionHost\",\r\n\"request\": \"launch\",\r\n\"runtimeExecutable\": \"${execPath}\",\r\n\"args\": [\r\n\t\"--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceRoot}\",\r\n\t\"--nolazy=true\",\r\n\t\"--verbose\",\r\n\t\"--wait\",\r\n\t\"--enable-logging\",\r\n\t\"--disable-http-cache\",\r\n\t\"--log-net-log=${workspaceRoot}/logs/net.log\"\r\n],\r\n\"sourceMaps\": true,\r\n\"outFiles\": [\r\n\t\"${workspaceRoot}/out/**/*.js\"\r\n],\r\n\"preLaunchTask\": \"npm\",\r\n\"stopOnEntry\": true\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nNODE_DEBUG=\"cluster,net,http,fs,tls,module,timers node\"\r\nELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING=\"true\"\r\ncode -p --verbose --wait --nolazy=true .\r\n```\r\n\r\n3 - What's the recommended way of setting breakpoints when doing extension development. The debugger isn't respecting my breakpoints and I have to manually force - enabling then disable - to get it to work. I've tried `\"debug.allowBreakpointsEverywhere\": true`. Setup is:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n-+= extension\r\n |-+= dep\r\n | |-+= dep\r\n |-+= dep\r\n | |-+= dep\r\n```\r\n\r\nall the `dep`s are TypeScript projects.  The debugger sees that I have set a breakpoint but doesn't stop at it.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15725","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15725/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15725/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15725/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15725","id":190312875,"number":15725,"title":"VSCode

an extension developer, I sometimes want to get the content of a textDocument identified by a URI from VS Code, but without opening it and triggering `onDidOpen` events.\r\n\r\nMy use case is [extending the `LanguageClient` to support the `textDocument/xfiles` extension](https://github.com/sourcegraph/language-server-protocol/blob/master/extension-files.md). Language servers in isolated environments need a way to request file contents without accessing the file system directly, and there should be a way to extend the `LanguageClient` to support these requests as well. I cannot read from disk because the URI could also be the URI of an in-memory document. \r\n\r\nThere are probably other use cases where an extension needs to inspect file contents without wanting VS Code to open them.\r\n\r\nCurrent API:\r\n```ts\r\n\t\t/**\r\n\t\t * All text documents currently known to the system.\r\n\t\t *\r\n\t\t * @readonly\r\n\t\t */\r\n\t\texport let textDocuments: TextDocument[];\r\n\r\n\t\t/**\r\n\t\t * Opens the denoted document from disk.

Two schemes are supported:\r\n\t\t *\r\n\t\t * file: A file on disk, will be rejected if the file does not exist or cannot be loaded, e.g. `file:///Users/frodo/r.ini`.\r\n\t\t * untitled: A new file that should be saved on disk, e.g. `untitled:c:\\frodo\\new.js`. The language will be derived from the file name.\r\n\t\t *\r\n\t\t * Uris with other schemes will make this method return a rejected promise.\r\n\t\t *\r\n\t\t * @param uri Identifies the resource to open.\r\n\t\t * @return A promise that resolves to a [document](#TextDocument).\r\n\t\t */\r\n\t\texport function openTextDocument(uri: Uri): Thenable<TextDocument>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\n```ts\r\n\t\t/**\r\n\t\t * Like openTextDocument(), but does not fire an didOpen event and does not add the document to the textDocuments array.\r\n                 * \r\n\t\t * @param uri Identifies the resource to open.\r\n\t\t * @return A promise that resolves to a [document](#TextDocument).\r\n\t\t */\r\n                export function getTextDocument(uri: Uri): Thenable<TextDocument>;\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15723/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4694","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"8460:2B9B:7DE7EC:100B5A1:59D93F1B","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=669>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=667>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"affc3683c6f678edfe4cdcb1f3c4dbc4\"","status":"200 OK"}}
