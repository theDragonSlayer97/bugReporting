So if a fast-forward merge is not possible, I don't want Git to automatically create a merge commit for me; I want to examine the situation and decide what to do for myself.\n\nTherefore, neither VS Code's \"Pull\" or \"Pull (Rebase)\" commands are really suitable for my preferred workflow. I would like one of the following features:\n1. (My preference): Allow me to specify a custom command to be added to VS Code's Git menu (the dropdown menu that you get by clicking on the three-dots icon). Bonus points if I can specify the position of the custom command (i.e., below Sync but above Pull). Then I could add `Pull (FF only)` to the menu and be able to use my preferred Git workflow.\n2. Allow me to customize the options on the Git command that is run when I choose one of the menu items. E.g., allow me to customize a `git.pull.options` config to add `--ff-only`. Then the \"Pull\" command that's already in the Git menu would do what I want it to do -- pull only if a fast-forward is possible, otherwise fetch and allow me to fo a merge or rebase manually.\n3. Add a \"Pull (FF only)\" command to the Git menu, which would run `git pull --ff-only`.\n\nCurrently I can do what I want by opening the integrated terminal and running `git pull --ff-only` on the command line, so this isn't a blocker for me. But it means I'm basically avoiding using VS Code's Git integration, because sometimes it will do the wrong thing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10007","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10007/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10007/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10007/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10007","id":168559858,"number":10007,"title":"White-space
