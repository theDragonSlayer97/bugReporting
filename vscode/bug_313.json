(reason: Cannot connect to the target: Parse Error).**\r\n\r\nThe same code/project works very well (without any changes) in the previous version of vscode (1.11.2).\r\n\r\nBut what is strange, is that the code still working in the background..My functions and other stuff are well executed...but I can't break on any breakpoints and I can't stop/start/pause the debugging process (with Play/Pause/Stop buttons that appears on the top when we start debugging) because buttons for doing that are not visible anymore.  So no break on breakpoints, no debug buttons but code still running in the background.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I didn't change anything in my code or in my project/debug configuration.\r\n\r\nHere is my

So VSCode's usage is non-standard.\r\n\r\nI'm new to schemas and the non-standard behavior caused some confusion. For example, I wanted to describe a JSON which is an object of objects:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"some\": {},\r\n    \"json\": {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nso I created this schema:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"object\",\r\n  \"patternProperties\": {\r\n    \".+\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"object\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand mapped it using the `$schema` keyword in the JSON file [according to the docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_mapping-in-the-json) but it yields this error:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/25918234/02e837d0-35cb-11e7-93b0-f71e57f0a4a4.png)\r\n\r\nIf I map it using any other method, e.g., settings.json, all works fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"json.schemas\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"fileMatch\": [\r\n                \"example.json\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"url\": \"./example.schema.json\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know the historic background but the simplest \"fix\" would be to remove the non-standard in-JSON mapping method ~~although to be entirely honest, I am more surprised that `$schema` inside JSON isn't supported by the JSON Schema standard; it seems quite logical to me~~ UPDATE: see comment below.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26406","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26406/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26406/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26406/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26406","id":227791653,"number":26406,"title":"Incorrect
