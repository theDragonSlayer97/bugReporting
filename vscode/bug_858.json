Create a new Console Application using the powershell script: \n   \n   ```\n   function New-ConsoleApplication {\n       param (\n           [string]$Path,\n           [string]$Name,\n           [bool]$Open,\n           [bool]$Run\n       )\n   \n       New-Item -Name $Name -Type Directory -Path $Path\n       cd \"$Path\\$Name\"\n       dotnet new\n       dotnet restore \n       if ($Open){code .}\n       if ($Run) {dotnet run}\n   }\n   \n   New-ConsoleApplication -Name \"ConsoleApplication\" -Path \"C:\\Users\\First.Surname\\Source\\\" -Open $true -Run $true`\n   ```\n2. The folder structure and code is created, and it is opened in VSCode. The application executes and prints \"Hello World!\" to the PowerShell terminal.\n\n**PowerShell Output:**\n\n```\n    Directory: C:\\Users\\Seb.Kotze\\Source\n\n\n    Mode                LastWriteTime     Length Name                              \n    ----                -------------     ------ ----                              \n    d----        02/08/2016     16:06            ConsoleApplication                \n    Created new C# project in C:\\Users\\Seb.Kotze\\Source\\ConsoleApplication.\n    log  : Restoring packages for C:\\Users\\Seb.Kotze\\Source\\ConsoleApplication\\proj\n    ect.json...\n    log  : Writing lock file to disk.

In VSCode, click `Debug` or `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `D`, then press `F5`\n2. Select `.NET Core` as the environment - `launch.json` is opened - then press `F5` again\n3. > No task runner configured\n4. Select `Configure Task Runner` - select `.NET Core` - `tasks.json` is opened\n5. Press `F5` to launch\n6. > launch: launch.json must be configured. Change 'program' to the path to the executable file that you would like to debug.\n7. open `launch.json` \n8. `Program` is given by : `\"${workspaceRoot}/bin/Debug/<target-framework>/<project-name.dll>\"`\n9. Changing this to the physical path of the `.dll` resolves the issue, but `VSCode` complains that : \n\n> Relative paths will no longer be automatically converted to absolute ones.

I assume this is related to the overhead of starting a new Electron window, loading, parsing and initializing all the JavaScript for VSCode's interface and plugins.\n\nNot sure if this has been considered or proposed before, but perhaps VSCode could pre-initialize an extra editor window in the background and keep it hidden. That way whenever `code -w` is invoked the window can appear to open instantaneously.\n\nI figure some people might not appreciate the tradeoff of extra RAM consumption for startup performance, so maybe this could be disabled by a flag?\n- VSCode Version:  1.3.1\n- OS Version: OS X 10.11.6\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10030/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10029","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10029/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10029/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10029/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10029","id":168759764,"number":10029,"title":"Emmet expansion problem","user":{"login":"EdFenner","id":3855021,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3855021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdFenner","html_url":"https://github.com/EdFenner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdFenner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdFenner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdFenner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdFenner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdFenner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdFenner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdFenner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdFenner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdFenner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-08-01T22:46:28Z","updated_at":"2016-08-01T23:52:24Z","closed_at":"2016-08-01T23:30:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:1.3.1\n- OS Version:1011.6\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. script:src\n2.
