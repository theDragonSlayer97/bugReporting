string as items.\r\nI can't find any guides on this, but I know this works.\r\n\r\nAnd if I want a property, witch is not array, to accept more than one data type, what would I do?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33417","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33417/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33417/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33417/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33417","id":253721289,"number":33417,"title":"Find
