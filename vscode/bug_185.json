VSCode Version: Code 1.13.1 (379d2efb5539b09112c793d3d9a413017d736f89, 2017-06-14T18:21:47.485Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 6.1.7601\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|perforce|slevesque|2.1.1|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Enter this code:\r\n```ts\r\nimport * as React from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass F extends React.Component<void, void> {\r\n    render() {\r\n        <React.DOM.div \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. With the cursor at the end of 'React.DOM.div' press control-space to bring up intellisense suggestions.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13541817/27976670-8ec3679c-6335-11e7-8446-97997056ca81.png)\r\n\r\nI see generic suggestions. I expect to see the props (properties, attributes) of div.\r\n\r\n3. add to the code by typing className='abc' as below:\r\nimport * as React from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass F extends React.Component<void, void> {\r\n    render() {\r\n        <React.DOM.div className='abc'\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n4. Place cursor at the end of 'abc'. Press control-space to get suggestions. Now you get suggestions for the props of div\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13541817/27976749-e8e08fb6-6335-11e7-85e9-e615d4f30e40.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the expected result in step 2 above. The issue is that the suggestions are not made until you have specified an initial attribute.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis same issue occurs for custom react components that are imported in a way that requires a dotted path. This can also be demonstrated by assigning to a local variable:\r\n\r\n5. Enter this code:\r\n\r\nimport * as React from 'react';\r\n\r\ninterface FooProps {\r\n    name: string;\r\n    value: number;\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Foo extends React.Component<FooProps, void> {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return <div/>\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// This is atypical, but models import * as lib from 'mylib', and shows same behavior\r\nlet lib = {Foo: Foo};\r\n\r\nclass Usage extends React.Component<void, void> {\r\n    render() { \r\n        return <lib.Foo\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n6. Press control-space after lib.Foo. I expect to see props suggestions, but again just get generic suggestions.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13541817/27976868-56bfd3d4-6336-11e7-82ea-a1698c642a5b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Add a property after lib.Foo (e.g. name='abc'), and then press control-space. This behaves as expected, showing suggestions for children, key, ref, and value.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13541817/27976926-87f3c654-6336-11e7-9765-f5e0d01fef29.png)\r\n\r\n8. If instead of using 'lib.Foo' in step 5 you just reference 'Foo' directly, then the suggestions are as expected:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13541817/27976970-b08b33d6-6336-11e7-9f05-fa19ed05fa0c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a major issue for our developers that are relying on intellisense for property suggestions with TSX, as many of our react components are imported using import * as vdl from 'VDL' and then referenced as vdl.VBox, vdl.Table, etc\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30269","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30269/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30269/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30269/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30269","id":241374211,"number":30269,"title":"Select

because of some external change to the folder structure that has nothing to do with vscode.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware if there are any pre-existing limitations, either due to architecture or design, and

it.\r\n\r\n![27021463-fb856e3c-4f37-11e7-9012-dfe09645339b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/173559/27970927-9460b0a4-6305-11e7-91e2-03164a64feaa.png)\r\n\r\n**Value prop:**\r\nMore metadata for a a given stack frames helps developers understand the context and by highlighting library code we can help developers to navigate their code faster.\r\n\r\nThis feature is inspired by Mozilla's Debugger.html project: https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/pull/3154\r\n\r\n**Steps:**\r\n- Extend stack frame view to render icon if available\r\n- Extend Debugger protocol?\r\n- Prototype

#30087 \r\n\r\nComplexity: 2\r\n\r\n- [x] any platform - **@sandy081**\r\n\r\nPlease look at some diffs like the ones presented in #30087 or #23636 .\r\n\r\nTwo things changed:\r\n\r\n* we do some post processing on the LCS result to present a more pleasant diff. This involves shifting diffs down (leads to better merge changes of adjacent diffs) and then shifting diffs back up (to align with empty lines or whitespace only lines).\r\n\r\n* diffing when trim whitespace is not ignored has changed substantially, i.e. lines are now diffed with trim whitespace ignored and then equal lines (with trim whitespace ignored) get diffed w.r.t. trim whitespace on a secondary pass.\r\n\r\nTo test, simply open some diffs and check if they represent better or worse the actual file edit.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelease Notes contribution (someone needs to paste this in to 1.15.md which doesn't exist yet):\r\n\r\nWith this release, we have made some tweaks to our diff algorithm to adjust the differences (which are found with the help of a Longest-Common-Substring algorithm) in such a way that they are more pleasing to the human eye.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, this means we will be more aligned with the output of `git diff` (which also incorporates some of these heuristics), but in other cases (like when only trim whitespace has changed), our result will no longer contain the LCS, so it will be different than `git diff`, but in our opinion it will also be more pleasing. \r\n\r\n> you can use a screenshot like in #23636 , just show a screenshot of `git diff` vs us in the case of indenting the code as in

\"toggle replace button\" (inside the yellow rectangle in the screenshot below) is broken in so many ways, let me enumerate them:\r\n\r\n1. It's whole purpose, I guess, is to hide a rarely used input in order to barely show a couple more lines of results. But why even hiding the \"replace\" input? I don't know about you but I've never found a use for the \"files excluded through settings\" input, it's not even editable, why not hiding it instead? maybe \"files to exclude\" as well? It seems like a more logic approach to me.\r\n2. We are wasting a whole bunch of pixels (in the red rectangle below) just because of it.\r\n3. Even if you open it, you'll probably find it closed anyway pretty soon. Just switch to another panel and come back to the search panel, it's closed again. I can't even count how many time I wrote inside the \"files to include\" input by mistake.\r\n4. It can't be opened with the keyboard, it needs to be clicked. Do you want to check the explorer or git while using it? Sorry, click it again.\r\n\r\nThe best solution to me is getting rid of it all together, but I guess a reasonable solution is to add the ability to hide it via a `search.alwaysOnInputs` setting or something.

(the scenario is mostly log files)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelease Notes contribution (someone needs to paste this in to 1.15.md which doesn't exist yet):\r\n\r\nLarge files are always a great way to stress-test an editor. We currently use a line based representation of the text buffer, which has some serious advantages, but also disadvantages, especially in terms of memory consumption (e.g. a file with very many short lines).\r\n\r\nAny file that is over 30MB or over 300K lines will be considered a large file and handled in certain code paths, specially. By choosing to disable certain features for such files, e.g. tokenization, line guides, wrapping or folding, we were able to optimize the memory usage, in some cases, by as much as 50%.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, large files will never travel to our web worker, which computes diff information, link detection, or word based completions. This helps in reducing the memory pressure on the OS.\r\n\r\nSome of the optimizations will impact all files, although the effects will be hard to notice with small files. We have decided to lift the hard coded file size limit of 50MB on 64-bit installations and enforce a 300MB file size limit of 32-bit installations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEmergency toggles:\r\n* [`MAX_FILE_ZIE`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/c5bf26a627a5641e0b0a76e8a0b9a6b56be9d434/src/vs/platform/files/common/files.ts#L527)\r\n* [`USE_MIMINAL_MODEL_LINE`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/dbbc064c1368bfec65a1611590a2a366d5cac61c/src/vs/editor/common/model/textModel.ts#L22) - uses a different implementation for `ModelLine` that does not have properties for all of the tokenization state and has a lazy markers property.\r\n* [`USE_IDENTITY_LINES_COLLECTION`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/dbbc064c1368bfec65a1611590a2a366d5cac61c/src/vs/editor/common/viewModel/viewModelImpl.ts#L24) - uses a different implementation for the ViewModel line mapping that prohibits wrapping and folding from working and assumes a 1:1 mapping.\r\n* [`AVOID_SLICED_STRINGS `](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/dbbc064c1368bfec65a1611590a2a366d5cac61c/src/vs/workbench/services/textfile/electron-browser/modelBuilder.ts#L14) - takes the strings that make up lines and runs them through a nodejs Buffer to avoid having a `(sliced string)` per line.\r\n* Additionally, all the commits that touched something w.r.t. memory improvements contain \"#30180\" in their message so if something horrible happens, git bisect on those commits should uncover it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30243/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30242","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30242/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30242/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30242/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/30242","id":241222209,"number":30242,"title":"Add
