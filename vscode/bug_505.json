but because it is used in Markdown extension.\r\n\r\nPR: markdown-it-named-header custom slugify for non-latin characters #20628\r\n\r\n**PROBLEM:**\r\n\r\nI want to realize an in-page link by using an anchor in Markdown Preview, but it does not work with non-latin characters.\r\nIf the header is written in non-latin characters (such as Japanese), it is judged to be an invalid character, so the value of the id attribute is empty.\r\n\r\n**BACKGROUND:**\r\n\r\nMarkdown-it-named-headers (mdnh) generates an id attribute from Markdown's header element and uses the slug() function provided by [`strings.js`](http://stringjs.com/) to convert the text to valid URL slug.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n# Example Header   -->   <h1 id=\"example-header\">Example</h1>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a problem with non-latin characters.\r\nIf the header is written in non-latin characters (such as Japanese), it is judged to be an invalid character, so the value of the id attribute is empty.\r\n\r\nAs a result of investigation, processing of non-latin characters can not be performed correctly.\r\n(However, it may be correct in the sense that it deletes a character string that can not be used in the URL.)\r\n\r\n* [string.js: slugify](http://stringjs.com/#methods/slugify)\r\n  * [slugify russian (non-english) words #43](https://github.com/jprichardson/string.js/issues/43)\r\n* [truncate doesn't work with non-latin characters (Japanese) #201](https://github.com/jprichardson/string.js/issues/201)\r\n\r\n\r\nSample Markdown: \r\n```markdown\r\n* [test](#test)\r\n* [さくら](#さくら)\r\n* [さくら 桜](#さくら-桜)\r\n* [🌸](#🌸)\r\n\r\n## test\r\n## さくら\r\n## さくら 桜\r\n## 🌸\r\n```\r\n\r\nRendered HTML:\r\n```html\r\n<li data-line=\"0\" class=\"code-line\"><a href=\"#test\">test</a></li>\r\n<li data-line=\"1\" class=\"code-line\"><a href=\"#%E3%81%95%E3%81%8F%E3%82%89\">さくら</a></li>\r\n<li data-line=\"2\" class=\"code-line\"><a href=\"#%E3%81%95%E3%81%8F%E3%82%89-%E6%A1%9C\">さくら 桜</a></li>\r\n<li data-line=\"3\" class=\"code-line\"><a href=\"#%F0%9F%8C%B8\">🌸</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 data-line=\"5\" class=\"code-line\" id=\"test\">test</h2>\r\n<h2 data-line=\"6\" class=\"code-line\" id=\"\">さくら</h2>      <--- here\r\n<h2 data-line=\"7\" class=\"code-line\" id=\"\">さくら 桜</h2>   <--- here\r\n<h2 data-line=\"8\" class=\"code-line\" id=\"\">🌸</h2>         <--- here\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Markdown extension, there is a process of creating an href link from a header when anchor `(#anchor)` is specified and rendering `<a href=\"\">` tag.\r\nIn this process, the non-latin characters appear to be encodeURI.\r\nI think it is a very good process.\r\n\r\nMarkdown-it-named-headers has an option to define custom slugify.\r\nSo, when a non-latin character was written in the header, I decided to define its custom slug() function.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n.use(mdnh, {\r\n\tslugify: function (header: string) {\r\n            return encodeURI(header.trim()\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t.toLowerCase()\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.replace(/[\\]\\[\\!\\\"\\#\\$\\%\\&\\'\\(\\)\\*\\+\\,\\.\\/\\:\\;\\<\\=\\>\\?\\@\\\\\\^\\_\\{\\|\\}\\~]/g, '') //remove symbol\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.replace(/\\s+/g, '-')) // Replace spaces with hyphens\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.replace(/\\-+$/, ''); // Replace trailing hyphen\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHTML rendered with custom slugify applied:\r\n```html\r\n<li data-line=\"0\" class=\"code-line\"><a href=\"#test\">test</a></li>\r\n<li data-line=\"1\" class=\"code-line\"><a href=\"#%E3%81%95%E3%81%8F%E3%82%89\">さくら</a></li>\r\n<li data-line=\"2\" class=\"code-line\"><a href=\"#%E3%81%95%E3%81%8F%E3%82%89-%E6%A1%9C\">さくら 桜</a></li>\r\n<li data-line=\"3\"

VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.10.0-insider (1d17b45a11d8db22fe95c601f793a3cb9a582ba6, 2017-02-14T09:49:25.026Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.15025\r\n- Extensions:\r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|python|donjayamanne|0.5.8|\r\n|cpptools|ms-vscode|0.10.1|\r\n|csharp|ms-vscode|1.7.0|\r\n|PowerShell|ms-vscode|0.9.0|\r\n|rewrap|stkb|1.2.0|\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Enter the following text into a new editor with UTF-8 encoding (the specific encoding of the file may not be important): `𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷𠮷` (these are all the character U+20BB7 encoded in UTF-8 as 0xF0 0xA0 0xAE 0xB7 / UTF-16 as the surrogate pair 0xD842 0xDFB7) \r\n2. Add a character (like 'a') to the beginning of the line which has only a single UTF-16 code unit [1].\r\n3. Observe that some of the original characters (at offsets which are multiples of 50) are now rendered as � (U+FFFD: REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, used to render unknown characters).\r\n4. Observe that copying a the entire run of text or just a selection including the � glyphs will paste into another line or another editor in VS Code or another program correctly as 𠮷. This seems to only affect the current line.\r\n5. Copy the text from step 1 multiple more times onto the end of the line and you will see the corruption repeat periodically, at every 50th column.\r\n\r\n[1] Examples:\r\n\r\n- The letter 'a' (ASCII) is encoded as a single byte (or a single UTF-16 char) causes the problem.\r\n- U+0280 LATIN SMALL LETTER CAPITAL \"ʀ\" [UTF-8: 0xCA 0x80 / UTF-16: 0x0280] causes the problem.\r\n- U+4F60 \"你\" [UTF-8: 0xE4 0xBD 0xA0 / UTF-16: 0x4F60] causes the problem.\r\n- U+20BB6 \"𠮶\" [UTF-8: 0xF0 0xA0 0xAE 0xB6 / UTF-16: 0xD842 0xDFB6] DOES NOT cause the problem.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the buffer for each line is encoded as UTF-16 and there's something funny about how unaligned surrogate pairs are handled at offsets which are multiples of 50 and the two halves of the surrogate pair occupy offsets x and y (where x mod 50 = 49; y mod 50 = 0) of the buffer (49, 50; 99, 100; 149, 150; etc.).\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/494055/22954819/7e5d849c-f2cd-11e6-8732-902b0b788dee.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20623","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20623/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20623/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20623/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20623","id":207662714,"number":20623,"title":"How to setup a development environment to debug an extension that uses local changes to vscode.d.ts?","user":{"login":"nicksnyder","id":754768,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/754768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicksnyder","html_url":"https://github.com/nicksnyder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicksnyder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicksnyder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicksnyder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicksnyder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicksnyder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicksnyder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicksnyder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicksnyder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicksnyder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2017-02-14T23:02:44Z","updated_at":"2017-02-16T16:50:11Z","closed_at":"2017-02-15T10:10:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I would like to experiment with some changes to vscode.d.ts (the API exposed to extensions).\r\n\r\nIn order to test these changes locally, I would like to be able to have an extension FOO such that\r\n1. FOO can consume the new/modified APIs in vscode.d.ts\r\n2. I can set breakpoints in FOO and VS Code for debugging.\r\n\r\nIn my case FOO=vscode-go (an extension that already exists).\r\n\r\n***tl;dr*** what is the recommended setup to accomplish what I want?\r\n\r\n\r\nLong version...here is what I have attempted...\r\n\r\n**Method 1:** Inline vscode-go into `vscode/extensions/vscode-go`.\r\n\r\nThis requires making quite a few changes in vscode\r\n- Exclude vscode-go from some lint rules in gulpfile.hygine.js\r\n- Add vscode-go to list of extensions in build/npm/postinstall.js\r\n- Update vscode-go's package.json\r\n    - Remove vscode as a dev dependency from vscode-go\r\n    - Remove references to `node ./node_modules/vscode/bin/install`\r\n    - Update compile and watch scripts to look like `gulp compile-extension:vscode-go` and `gulp watch-extension:vscode-go`\r\n- Add a refs.d.ts to point to local version of vscode.d.ts\r\n    ```\r\n    /// <reference path='../../../../src/vs/vscode.d.ts'/>\r\n    /// <reference path='../../../../src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts'/> \r\n    ```\r\n- Extension specific hacking. For vscode-go this involved\r\n    - Updating main entry point due to how extension compilation works\r\n        ```\r\n        -\"main\": \"./out/src/goMain\",\r\n        +\"main\": \"./out/goMain\",\r\n        ``` \r\n    - Rewriting some import paths\r\n        ```\r\n        -import { getBinPathFromEnvVar } from '../src/goPath';\r\n       +import { getBinPathFromEnvVar } from './goPath';\r\n        ```\r\n    - Export interfaces that need to be exported\r\n    - Update settings in tsconfig.json\r\n\r\nI had this method working for a bit (both debugging and consuming new APIs), but within the last 24 hours debugging has broken twice (I can't seem to step in to function calls once I hit a breakpoint). I was able to \"fix\" this the first time by trying to re-do my setup (ultimately I am not sure what fixed it), but now that it has broken again (and I am not sure what causes this setup to break), I have so far been unable to fix it my repeating my setup process.\r\n\r\n**Method 2:** use --extensionDevelopmentPath\r\n\r\nThis is something that I have just started trying because it seems less than ideal to need to \"inline\" extensions into vscode via method 1.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this method is to use `./scripts/code.sh --extensionDevelopmentPath=/Users/nick/code/vscode-go`.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n- Update vscode-go's package.json\r\n    - Remove vscode as a dev dependency from vscode-go\r\n    - Remove references to `node ./node_modules/vscode/bin/install`\r\n- Add a refs.d.ts to point to local version of vscode.d.ts\r\n    ```\r\n    /// <reference path='../../../../src/vs/vscode.d.ts'/>\r\n    /// <reference path='../../../../src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts'/> \r\n    ```\r\n\r\nRight now I am stuck on trying to get breakpoints to work with this method. Setting a breakpoint in vscode-go requires vscode-go to be a subdirectory of my project.\r\n\r\nI tried creating a sandbox directory that contains just vscode and vscode-go. In this directory I have a .vscode/launch.json that looks like this\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible Node.js debug attributes.\r\n    // Hover to view descriptions of

The issue is still present in the latest Insider's build (1d17b45a11d8db22f).\r\n\r\nOther debug adapters seem to have the same issue, as suggested by [this StackOverflow question][2] regarding the same error message with ASP.NET.\r\n\r\nIssue #4608 seems somewhat related to this.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/vshaxe/vshaxe-debugadapter\r\n[2]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42143768/vs-code-give-me-this-error-unable-to-open-unknown-source-file-not-found-un\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20621","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20621/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20621/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20621/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20621","id":207656201,"number":20621,"title":"Make Code Insider executable with a shorter name like codei","user":{"login":"vairamsvsjdo","id":22436725,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22436725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vairamsvsjdo","html_url":"https://github.com/vairamsvsjdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vairamsvsjdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vairamsvsjdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vairamsvsjdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vairamsvsjdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vairamsvsjdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vairamsvsjdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vairamsvsjdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vairamsvsjdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vairamsvsjdo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":386618042,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-02-14T22:31:41Z","updated_at":"2017-02-16T08:11:26Z","closed_at":"2017-02-15T09:37:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
