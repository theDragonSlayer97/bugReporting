I observed that there are two error messages showing up in my .ts file and when I closely watched, I found there is no extension installed for TS lint. I also removed extension for ESlint as well and restarted app.\n\nI observer that still it is showing two errors messages in the editor and when I hover over on it, it is displaying : \n1.
