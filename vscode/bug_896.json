VSCode Version: 1.3.0\n- OS Version: OSX El Cap 10.11.5\n- .NET Core Version: 1.0.0-preview2-003121\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. As normal, use debugger for ASP.NET debugging\n2. Upgrade VS Code from 1.2.1 to 1.3.0\n3. Debugging no longer works. Error message given in VS Code debug console window:\n\n> ERROR: CLRDBG exited unexpectedly with exit code 133 (0x85). Debugging will now abort.\n> The program '/Users/Me/MyPath/MyProgram.dll' has exited with code -1 (0xffffffff).\n\nI re-installed .NET Core just to be on the safe side--no difference. I was already running the latest version. I also noticed after I installed the new version of VS Code that a background process re-installed the debug module (? details hazy--I just saw it on the status bar on the bottom of the screen).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8878","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8878/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8878/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8878/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8878","id":164446684,"number":8878,"title":"Include
