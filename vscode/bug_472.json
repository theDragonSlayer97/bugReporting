I think it is because of the rules you use to mark the end of a for loop.\r\n\r\nI tried to see if I could fix it myself and send a pull request, but you'are using node.js which I'm not familiar, and the code base seems to be a little huge.

I can increase the `timeout` in my configuration, but I have noticed that VS Code results with a message `Cannot connect to runtime process (timeout after 30000 ms).` eventually, so I assume that this is not a good solution.
