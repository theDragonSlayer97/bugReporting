Make sure workspace settings override user settings and default settings.\r\n- Workspace settings come from `.vscode` folder under the folder.\r\n- Update User settings and Workspace settings and verify the updates.\r\n- Update settings using User actions and verify updates\r\n-- Have `files.associations` setting in Workspace scope and try to update the file association using the language mode on the status bar.

Then:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst configuration = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('testExtension', vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri);\r\n\r\n// Verify the methods on configuration object are working as expected\r\nconfiguration.get('resourceConfiguration');\r\nconfiguration.inspect('resourceConfiguration');\r\nconfiguration.update('resourceConfiguration', false, vscode.ConfigurationTarget.WorkspaceFolder)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- Verify you can read and write settings correctly in all kinds of workspaces. \r\n\r\n### Configuration API behaviour in Empty workspace\r\n\r\nWhen configuration is asked with or without a resource\r\n- There will be no workspace and folder settings.\r\n- Inspect returns undefined for workspace and folder values always\r\n- Writing into workspace or folder settings results to an error.\r\n\r\n### Configuration API behaviour in Folder workspace\r\n\r\nWhen configuration is asked with or without a resource\r\n- There will be no folder settings.\r\n- Inspect returns undefined for folder values always\r\n- Writing into folder settings results to an error.\r\n\r\n### Configuration API behaviour in Multi Folder workspace\r\n\r\nWhen configuration is asked for a resource\r\n\r\n- Inspect returns values for all targets unless undefined.\r\n- You can only write `resource` scoped setting into folder.
