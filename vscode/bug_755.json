Open up VS Code.\n2. Use the Terminal window by typing something in.\n\nI never really noticed too much but with the latest versions of Code and Ionide (which use the Terminal window now for F# output), I've noticed that the Terminal window is really, really slow - not just for output sent to the terminal from F# but also just typing in the standard terminal - long pauses (1/2 seconds) before it \"catches up\" with what I'm typing etc.. It also blocks the main editor window whilst these pauses happen.\n\nI suppose that this could be any number of things - happy to help provide more details that would help.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13127","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13127/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13127/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13127/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13127","id":180471307,"number":13127,"title":"TypeScript decorators not recognized","user":{"login":"jorgeas80","id":772448,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/772448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgeas80","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgeas80","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgeas80/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgeas80/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgeas80/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgeas80/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgeas80/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgeas80/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgeas80/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgeas80/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgeas80/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":291055694,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/typescript","name":"typescript","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-10-01T18:16:30Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T14:46:57Z","closed_at":"2016-10-31T14:46:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.5.3\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

Try to copy selected text with mouse or keyboard\n\nExpected:\nI should be able to copy selected warning/error text in any way (keyboard or mouse)\n\nActual:\nI'm not able to copy selected warning/error text in any way\n\nThat's not a problem with my own code, but sometimes I have to pass just the information about the problem to other people.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13114","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13114/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13114/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13114/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13114","id":180447327,"number":13114,"title":"Bundled
