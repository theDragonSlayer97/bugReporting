when one hovers over a selector in a CSS file it gives a preview of what it selects. This is useful for beginners or if you just forget what a particular selector does.\n\nWhat would make this even more useful is to also include the specificity of the selector in the preview popup. Many beginners/intermediate don't understand specificity, which is why you often see super specific selectors all over. Even for experts, it would be quicker than calculating yourself for longer selectors.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n-----------------------------\n<select>\n…\n<option :checked>\nSpecificity: 0,1,2\n-----------------------------\nselect option:checked\n```\n\nNote: I used how CSS2.1 defines specificity. CSS3 Selectors defines it as 012, which I think is confusing as it makes it look like if there were 10 classes or pseudo classes it would be 102 rather than 0102. CSS 4 Selectors shows it as a=0 b=1 c=2.\n\nCode already exists to calculate specificity in JS if you want to add using 3rd party code https://github.com/keeganstreet/specificity\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7299/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7298","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7298/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7298/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7298/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7298","id":158848184,"number":7298,"title":"Chinese characters displayed overlapped.","user":{"login":"MonsterSupreme","id":1573411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1573411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterSupreme","html_url":"https://github.com/MonsterSupreme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterSupreme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterSupreme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterSupreme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterSupreme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterSupreme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterSupreme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterSupreme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterSupreme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterSupreme/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-07T06:23:52Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T07:18:29Z","closed_at":"2016-06-07T07:18:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.2.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10, Traditional Chinese\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
