VSCode Version: Code 1.14.0 (b8cd5b9556d8b70ea560d35b903422363f6c5c40, 2017-07-10T18:36:31.751Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.15063\r\n- Extensions: the listing length exceeds browsers' URL characters limit\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt seems that when using the Bash on Windows as the VSC's shell, commands ran through tasks act as if they received no arguments (npm showing just the default help, etc.).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Have `\"terminal.external.windowsExec\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\sysnative\\\\bash.exe\",  \"terminal.integrated.shell.windows\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\sysnative\\\\bash.exe\"` in your settings\r\n2. Open empty folder\r\n3. `Tasks -> Configure Tasks -> Others` (this will add the default `echo Hello` task)\r\n4. Run the `echo` task, which will **not** actually echo \"Hello\"\r\n5. Editing the task command to `echo Hello > test.txt` and running the task will create the `test.txt` file, but the file will contain just two newlines\r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30551","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30551/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30551/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30551/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30551","id":242527484,"number":30551,"title":"After \"disable all extensions\" and clicking reload, all extensions vanish until Code is restarted","user":{"login":"axefrog","id":298883,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/298883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog","html_url":"https://github.com/axefrog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":343063018,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/extensions","name":"extensions","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-07-12T21:55:29Z","updated_at":"2017-09-01T15:01:25Z","closed_at":"2017-09-01T15:01:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.15.0-insider\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
