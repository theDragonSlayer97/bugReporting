VSCode Version: 1.3.1 (Commit e6b4afa53e9c0f54edef1673de9001e9f0f547ae)\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty), Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial), Debian 8.4 (Jessie), Linux Mint 18 (Sarah)\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open VS Code.\n2. Press `Ctrl-backtick` to open integrated terminal.\n3. Observe whether the terminal prompt is colored or not.\n## Details\n\nOn Debian-based systems (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint), the default `.bashrc` in users' home folders sets the prompt to `(username)@(hostname):(current working directory)$(space)`. Additionally, if the terminal is capable of displaying color, it uses terminal escapes to color the username and hostname green, and the current working directory blue. The way the default `.bashrc` detects a color-capable terminal is by looking at the value of the `$TERM` environment variable; if it is `xterm-color` or `xterm-256color`, the color prompt is used; otherwise, a black&white prompt is used.\n\nAnd this is where VS Code comes into the picture. In [line 18 of `terminalProcess.js`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/9a7ec35a6adc97b7b611a9bdc6228eaea7c6be0d/src/vs/workbench/parts/terminal/electron-browser/terminalProcess.js#L18) (link is to the current `master` branch of VS Code as of the time when I'm writing this issue report), VS Code looks for the file `/usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm-256color`. If it is present, then the `name` variable is set to `xterm-256color`, otherwise it is set to `xterm`. It seems that `name` eventually ends up as the value of the `$TERM` environment variable.\n\nAnd here is where there's a bit of a problem. On Debian, and distributions like Ubuntu and Mint that derive from Debian, there is no `/usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm-256color` file. The Debian package that contains `xterm-256color` puts it in `/lib/terminfo/x/xterm-256color` instead. (There is also a `/usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm+256color` file, but that one is not guaranteed to be installed on all systems since it is not marked as \"essential\". But the Debian `ncurses-base` package, which is marked as \"essential\" and therefore guaranteed to be installed on all systems, installs the `/lib/terminfo/x/xterm-256color` file).\n\nTherefore, since `/usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm-256color` doesn't exist, when VS Code opens an integrated terminal it sets `$TERM` to be `xterm` instead of `xterm-256color`. And then Debian's `.bashrc` says \"Oh, this isn't a color-capable terminal, better not use the color prompt\".\n\n**Note about Linux Mint:** In Linux Mint 18, the `.bashrc` has been modified to also use a color prompt if `$TERM` is set to `xterm`. Therefore, also Visual Studio Code still sets `$TERM` to `xterm`, incorrectly stating that it is not color-capable, Mint 18 actually _ignores_ this and uses a color prompt _anyway_. However, other programs run from inside the integrated terminal may see the incorrect value of `$TERM` and choose not to display color when they could have, so it's still worth fixing this for Mint as well. Thankfully, Mint places its `xterm-256color` file in the same place as Debian and Ubuntu, so the suggested fix is the same for all of these distributions.\n## Suggested fix\n\nThe `fs.existsSync('/usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm-256color')` line in `src/vs/workbench/parts/terminal/electron-browser/terminalProcess.js` could instead be changed to check for two files instead of just one:\n\n```\nname = (fs.existsSync('/usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm-256color') || fs.existsSync('/lib/terminfo/x/xterm-256color')) ? 'xterm-256color' : 'xterm';\n```\n\nI have tested this change on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) and it has the desired effect: inside the integrated terminal, `$TERM` is now set to `xterm-256color` and the Bash prompt is now colored instead of black&white. I have not tested this on the other affected distributions, but there is no reason why it should not work there as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9680","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9680/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9680/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9680/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9680","id":167301202,"number":9680,"title":"Should brackets follow a method or function","user":{"login":"leaxoy","id":8556349,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8556349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leaxoy","html_url":"https://github.com/leaxoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leaxoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leaxoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leaxoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leaxoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leaxoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leaxoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leaxoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leaxoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leaxoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":291055694,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/typescript","name":"typescript","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-25T07:35:57Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T10:13:46Z","closed_at":"2016-08-04T10:13:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.3.1\n- OS Version: macOS 10.12\n\nWhen I use `tab` or `enter` to select a method or function.

view title with the icon, which is not the case for new users, and even some experienced/distracted.~~ The high-contrast themes show an orange border which is clearly visible, but not other themes.\n\nBesides that, whenever a icon is pressed twice, the view panel disappears. This is related to the first case: if the user is not sure about what view is selected, he/she will end pressing an icon twice and the panel will disappear, while it was expected just to switch views.
