Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.10.1 & Insider for Mar 8 2017 \r\n- OS Version: Win 10 RS1\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install an extension with fairly long diagnostic hovers (an example included below)\r\n2. trigger the diagnostic hover\r\n3. notice that the wrapping of text is breaking words, which makes reading the hover content much more difficult\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely certain what to recommend to address this.  For the majority of text it is better to just have the word drop down a line rather than be broken, but for long URLs and such breaking a word is preferable.  I don't know if you can selectively break words by wrapping them in a span with css \"word-wrap: break-word;\", but if you can a strategy might be to preprocess the hover text and wrap URLs/UNC paths in said span (I don't know what else other than URLs and paths would be long enough that they need to break-word to fit in the hover box).  Alternatively, and this is my preference, you could support links within the hover, so that link text rather than the full URL can be shown.  That both makes it easier for people to access the URL (they could just click on it, instead of copying it out of the hover box and pasting in a browser) and provides a mechanism to show shorter text that doesn't need to be broken up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want a diagnostic that reproduces this scenario you can grab and install vscode-devskim-0.1.0.vsix from https://github.com/Microsoft/DevSkim-VSCode-Plugin.  Once installed, create a new .cpp file and type  gets(str); into it - DevSkim will catch the use of gets and add a diagnostic with text long enough that it triggers the undesired wrap conditions\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22238","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22238/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22238/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22238/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22238","id":212809373,"number":22238,"title":"Feature Request: ability to review 'git push' and compare to remote","user":{"login":"MonkeySlut","id":24479175,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/24479175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeySlut","html_url":"https://github.com/MonkeySlut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeySlut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeySlut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeySlut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeySlut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeySlut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeySlut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeySlut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeySlut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeySlut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-08T17:57:25Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T08:36:22Z","closed_at":"2017-03-09T08:36:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey, I may be missing something but, as for now when I finish coding and had already made some local commits and I'm ready to push changes to remote git branch, I cannot review the changes or even select which files should be pushed. \r\nUse cases: \r\n1.

In order to correct that I tried using decimals on the window.zoom setting.  While this does work, it then causes zoom in and out to behave strangely.  Specifically it looks like (in javascript terms) Math.round() is being called prior to zooming with the hotkeys.  In other words, a setting of 1.1 and hitting zoom up sets it to 2, while a setting of 1.6 zoomed up sets it to 3.  This doesn't seem right at all, and also, it doesn't always live update that screen immediately, sometimes you'll need to close the preferences window and reopen.  Let me know if you need more information.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22226","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22226/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22226/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22226/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22226","id":212758305,"number":22226,"title":"Typo

Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.10.1 (653f8733)\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro (10.0.14393)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Have following user snippets defined\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"lc\": {\r\n        \"prefix\": \"lc\",\r\n        \"description\": \"external character\",\r\n        \"body\": [\r\n            \"define variable lc${<name>} as character no-undo.\"\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"ilc\": {\r\n        \"prefix\": \"ilc\",\r\n        \"description\": \"define input parameter character\",\r\n        \"body\": [\r\n            \"define input parameter ilc${<name>} as character no-undo.\"\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Have following user settings\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"editor.tabCompletion\": true,\r\n    \"editor.quickSuggestions\": false,\r\n    \"editor.snippetSuggestions\": \"top\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Try both snippets\r\n- `lc` triggers `lc` snippet\r\n- `ilc` does not work (`tab` does not trigger snippet)\r\n- `xlc` triggers `lc` snippet\r\n4. Delete `lc` snippet\r\n- `ilc` triggers `ilc` snippet\r\n\r\nWhich is both logical and strange. It is logical, kind of, because in `ilc` it presumably matches both `lc` and `ilc`. It does not show the `lc` in suggestions though. In suggestions it shows only `ilc` and yet it does not expand it on `tab`.\r\n\r\nWhen I, in step 3, use `xlc` and press `Ctrl + Space` to show suggestions, I do not see any. But if I press `Tab`, the `xlc` will expand to `xdefine variable lc${<name>} as character no-undo.` (take notice of the `x` at the beginning). It is strange, because it does not suggest anything, yet it expands.\r\n\r\nIn all those cases though, it is possible to expand the snippet manually through suggestions window (if populated).\r\n\r\nIs this the right behaviour? Is it possible for me to have fully functional both `lc` and `ilc`? I have a lot of snippets from UltiSnips where one prefix is superset of another.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22215","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22215/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22215/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22215/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22215","id":212714719,"number":22215,"title":"Align
