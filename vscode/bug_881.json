Since Code uses %comspec% as it's default terminal, this breaks a lot of things on 64 bit machines. \n\nTo make dealing with this easier, I think there should be a drop down similar to the terminal selection one where we can configure multiple terminals.  Then Code can add some of the native ones as default values and allow users to add new ones.\n\nExample on windows 64bit:\n\n``` json\n\"terminal.integrated.shell.windows.options\": { \n    \"PowerShell (x64)\": \"C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\sysnative\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell.exe\",\n    \"PowerShell (x86)\": \"C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell.exe\",\n    \"Cmd (x64)\": \"C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\sysnative\\\\cmd.exe\",\n    \"Cmd (x86)\": \"C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\cmd.exe\"\n}\n```\n\nExample on windows 32bit:\n\n``` json\n\"terminal.integrated.shell.windows.options\": { \n    \"PowerShell\": \"C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell.exe\",\n    \"Cmd\": \"C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\cmd.exe\"\n}\n```\n\nYou could also do something to add Shell Args in there as well, which I am really hoping Windows gets some day.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9353/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9352","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9352/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9352/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9352/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9352","id":165819871,"number":9352,"title":"Allow new editor to open with an empty file","user":{"login":"prashaantt","id":390540,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/390540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashaantt","html_url":"https://github.com/prashaantt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashaantt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashaantt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashaantt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashaantt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashaantt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashaantt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashaantt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashaantt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashaantt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-15T15:53:10Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T10:31:34Z","closed_at":"2016-08-05T10:31:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.4.0-insider\n- OS Version: macOS 10.11.5\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
