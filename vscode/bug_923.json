I know that we have a way to see if selections are changed, but the difficulty is that the Vim plugin changes the selections a lot, which makes it difficult to know _who_ changed the selections - me or you. `onClick` would solve this problem.

VSCode Version: 1.2.1\n- OS Version: Wind10\n\nI just added latex snippets to the [julia](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia) extension. These snippets essentially map things like `\\eta` onto `η`. This is very hand for scientific code.\n\nOne problem is that we will have snippets like `\\eta` and `\\Eta`, where the lower case will translate to the lower case greek letter and the upper case version to the upper case greek letter. But the snippet filtering right now is not case sensitive: when I enter `\\Eta`, it will select `\\eta` as the default and show `\\Eta` as the second item in the list.\n\nI think the best solution here would be this:\n1. if there is a case-sensitive match, select that by default\n2.
