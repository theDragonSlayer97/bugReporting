VSCode Version: 1.5.0-insider \n- OS Version: Mac OS X El Capitan\n\nThe window.ShowInputBox method was previously returning an empty string when the user hit OK, but in recent insider builds it now returns undefined for both Escape (cancel) and Enter (OK). This does not match the documented behavior and I cannot see a way to distinguish between user canceling or having default input chosen. This makes it very hard to write extensions that support default input values.\n\nNote that the documentation states \n\n> The returned value will be undefined if the input box was canceled (e.g. pressing ESC). Otherwise the returned value will be the string typed by the user or an empty string if the user did not type anything but dismissed the input box with OK.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\n\nThe easiest repro is to install the [BowerVSCode](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/bowerVSCode) plugin from the marketplace, execute the \"Bower\" command from the F1 menu and choose the Init option. Then for the Name input hit Enter to use the default name\n\nExpected:\n- Workflow continues to the next step (Description) as the input box returns the empty string (and bower knows that this means use the default)\n\nActual:\n- Workflow ends because when Enter is input, undefined is returned to the caller instead of the empty string. This is interpreted as cancellation per the API documentation\n\n**Code Example**\n1. Write an extension calling window.showInputBox - here is a\n   [BowerVSCode](https://github.com/DonJayamanne/bowerVSCode/blob/master/src/prompts/input.ts) example:\n\n```\nreturn window.showInputBox(this._options)\n.then(result => {\n    if (result === undefined) {\n                // Hitting Enter gets to here, which is not expected\n        throw new EscapeException();\n    }\n\n    if (result === '') {\n                // Expected hitting Enter to mean code goes here\n        result = 'my default value';\n    }\n\n    return result;\n});\n```\n1. Execute the code to show the input box, and hit Enter. Notice that the result is undefined, when we would expect it to be ''.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10639","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10639/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10639/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10639/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10639","id":171791065,"number":10639,"title":"After
