The content of the external file will then be altered, after which the content will be put back into the original file (active document).\n\nThe issue here is that there is no way to be absolutely sure which character encoding the external file uses. So, when trying to read from the external file, the encoding has to be guessed. This is not very reliable, of course. The same goes for writing to that file.\n\nSo, in code this looks like:\n\n```\nvar fs = require('fs');\n\n// [...]\n\nvar activeDocumentContent = vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.getText();\nfs.writeFileSync('myfile.txt', activeDocumentContent, {encoding: 'utf8'});\n\n// [...] do stuff to the external file\n\nfs.createReadStream('myfile.txt', {encoding: 'utf8'});\n```\n\nIt would be great if there was a way to get the document's encoding, like so, for example:\n\n`vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.getEncoding();`\n\nThe workaround at the moment is to use a package that detects character encodings.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11689","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11689/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11689/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11689/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11689","id":175751125,"number":11689,"title":"Editor

popularity of the embedded documentation conventions like JSDoc and C#'s XML comments leads to a situation where comments often constitute the bigger part of a source file (e.g. look at the source of [angular.js](https://unpkg.com/angular/angular.js): the whole API documentation is there!). This abundance of comments makes it extremely difficult to find anything in the source code proper. For example, reading someone's code, we might want to know how and where a certain function is used. However, if we decide to conduct a search by its name, we might get lost in dozens of code samples in the comments and overlook some important case of its real usage. Shift-F12 often helps in such situations, but not always. This undermines the habitual workflow of those who are used to rely a lot on the search to read the code. Not sure if any other editor has this feature, but it would be great to have the 'Ignore comments' option in VS Code's search dialog.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11688/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11687","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11687/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11687/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11687/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11687","id":175749940,"number":11687,"title":"App Freeze on huge JS files","user":{"login":"con-ssc","id":8189808,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8189808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/con-ssc","html_url":"https://github.com/con-ssc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/con-ssc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/con-ssc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/con-ssc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/con-ssc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/con-ssc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/con-ssc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/con-ssc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/con-ssc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/con-ssc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-09-08T13:12:23Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T17:51:18Z","closed_at":"2016-09-29T17:51:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.4.0 (6276dcb0ae497766056b4c09ea75be1d76a8b679, 2016-08-04T16:45:31.680Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.10586\n\nHaving multiple large (3000+ lines) JavaScript files open seems to crash the language server.

some changes, diff hunks (groups of changed lines) can be computed in different ways.

The first blank line will now show up as its own hunk (correctly), but the section that was added in the middle will be split into two hunks. Note that we have added two sections to our file, but the diff unnecessarily shows it as three sections having been added:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/995315/18346540/99ad2b72-75b8-11e6-9042-9d638b89c0ec.png)\n\nYou can see an actual screenshot from code of mine below (there are other changes above it as well). In this code, it would be very good if we at a glance could see that there was one big change, but instead it (at a glance) looks like two changes.

VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10 x64 Anniversary\n\nI have a feature request. I'm currently trying to get VSCode to debug node running in WSL, but I'd like to be able to use the \"Launch\" action also to launch node in WSL with the given settings.\n\nI created a custom \"wsl_node.exe\" file (and set it as \"runtimeExecutable\") which launches bash with -c, calling a script, and passing a filtered view of environment variables and the current directory as well as the command line arguments. Then, my script changes the directory in bash to the /mnt-equivalent of the original current directory, sets the environment variables and runs node inside WSL with the given arguments, passing through its output and exit code.\n\nThis works so far, except for the fact that I have to use \"externalConsole\", otherwise I only get an error 0x80070057. I am able to use \"debugger;\" or \"stopOnEntry\", and then I can debug. However, the breakpoints and the project tree don't work right, because VSCode gets the path as \"/mnt/c/xyz\" instead of \"C:\\xyz\".\n\nI saw there is a \"remoteRoot\" which solves this problem, but it appears like it works only when attaching, not when launching... Is there any way I could solve this, or support for it could be added? I assume, though, that not many people will use this feature alone, so maybe support for a better integration with node running inside WSL could be helpful...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11680","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11680/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11680/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11680/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11680","id":175696312,"number":11680,"title":"Configuring
