I believe this is because in the text mate grammar, the `while` of the paragraph  matching regular expression terminates too soon\n\n**Fix**\nIn the `while`, inside the negative lookahead that checks for headers or lists, add a condition so that the negative look ahead only applies when the element being looked for is on a new line\n\n**Testing**\nTried out a few markdown files and colorization generally seems to be improved.\n\nRan the colorization test scripts and the markdown one was still passing.\n\nHere's an example I was using to test a few edge cases:\n\n```\n`a`\n`b` `c` *d*\n`e` `f` *g*\n`h` `i` *j*\n`h` `i` *j*\n\n# h1 \n\n`h`\n`h` `i` *j*\n`h` `i` *j*\n\n1. a\n2. b\n3. c\n\n`a`\n`b` `c` *d*\n`e` `f` *g*\n`h` `i` *j*\n`h` `i` *j*\n```\n\nBefore change:\n<img width=\"255\"

VSCode Version: Code 1.5.2 (66f37fd2a99eb9d628dd374d81d78835b410c39b, 2016-09-12T13:30:03.456Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14915\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Sorry, no specific steps to repro\n\nAfter having VS Code open for a while, editing multiple tabs, etc., sometimes the UI will become corrupted as in the following screenshot, and every action taken (moving the cursor, switching tabs, typing, resizing the window, etc.) causes the black squares and unrendered text in the window to move around).\n\nThe amount of time VS Code is open before corruption can occur, or number of tabs opened before corruption occurs seems random. I've seen this start when as few as 1 tab (or even a lot of tabs) are open, or if it has been running for as little as a couple minutes, up to many hours.\n\nThe only workaround seems to be to restart VS Code which is a pain especially because it doesn't have an automatic session restore like Notepad++ does.\n\nI've been encountering this issue periodically since Insiders 1.3 or so but I've been trying to get some kind of reliable repro before reporting -- but I've been unable to do so, so I'm reporting it now.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/494055/18653633/009c6eda-7e90-11e6-8ad1-2e57646397ea.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12291","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12291/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12291/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12291/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/12291","id":177933676,"number":12291,"title":"Remove

VSCode Version: 1.5.2\n- OS Version: OSX 10.10.5, Win 7 x64\n\nIs it possible to open a new file buffer via the API? Essentially, when you use your mouse (or keyboard shortcuts) and goto File menu > New File, it creates a new Untitled file buffer in the workspace. When you Save the file, it opens a Save File dialog where you choose where to save it along with the filename. Is it possible to create a new file buffer in this same manner via the API? If not, can this feature be added?\n\nI have messed around with the API quite a bit in this area and if it is currently possible, it's not clear in the documentation.\n\nI know you can do this:\n\n```\nwindow.openTextDocument(Uri.parse(\"untitled:c:\\\\project\\\\myfile.txt\"))\n  .then((document) => {\n    window.showTextDocument(document);\n  });\n```\n\nBut this requires that you specify the file path for this new \"untitled\" file. When you hit save, it forces the file to be saved at \"c:\\project\\myfile.txt\". The user is not given the chance to specify where to save the file or what filename to give it.\n\nTo make a long story short, I essentially want the same functionality as going to File menu > New File. Does that make sense?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12283/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12282","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12282/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12282/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12282/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12282","id":177869944,"number":12282,"title":"html document unchanged running on mamp server and in app database","user":{"login":"AnthonyMichaelc","id":13970615,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13970615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyMichaelc","html_url":"https://github.com/AnthonyMichaelc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyMichaelc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyMichaelc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyMichaelc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyMichaelc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyMichaelc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyMichaelc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyMichaelc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyMichaelc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyMichaelc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-09-19T19:08:50Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T19:13:51Z","closed_at":"2016-09-19T19:13:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.5.2\n- OS Version: El Capitan 10.11.6\n\nWas using a local host mamp server to do development and using the in app database for a login page.

Is there anything else I can do to try to debug this? The only Error I have been seeing in the Debug tools is the following:\n\n```\n\"Failed to clear temp storage: It was determined that certain files are unsafe for access within a Web application, or that too many calls are being made on file resources. SecurityError\"\n```\n\nThe problem with that error is it doesn't happen all the time and sometimes seems to happen a little while after Code has been started up.\n\nIf I check my extensions in the Stable version of Code, I am seeing similar results.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12280","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12280/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12280/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12280/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12280","id":177867376,"number":12280,"title":"window.showTextDocument

Show a text document\n2. With that document still in focus, attempt to call showTextDocument with the document object.\n\nwindow.showTextDocument seems to have performance problems (1-1.5 second promise resolve) when calling it with a document that is already in focus.\n\nCalling showTextDocument on a document that is open but not in focus for one of the editor windows does not show this performance problem.\n\nEdit: Clarification: This seems to be a performance problem specifically for the promise resolving. You can visually see the window come into focus in a reasonable amount of time, but the promise resolving with the editor object is greatly delayed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12279","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12279/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12279/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12279/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/12279","id":177867021,"number":12279,"title":"Add
