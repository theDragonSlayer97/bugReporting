in order to get any information from the user, an extension has the following options:\r\n* `showInputBox()`\r\n* `showQuickPick()`\r\n\r\nBoth of those methods allow getting a single piece of information. (as opposed to a form containing multiple fields for the user to fill in)\r\n\r\nWhile this is particularly efficient for getting simple data. (e.g. a \"Rename\" command might use `showInputBox()` to get the new name of a variable) it is (IMHO) rather inconvenient for getting more complex information.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if an extension wants to show a \"wizard\" that creates a new project in the currently open directory, an intuitive way would be to show a \"window\" that allows the user to fill in such parameters as:\r\n1. Project name\r\n1. The version of the language/standard to use\r\n1. Project template\r\n1. etc.\r\n\r\nSince, VSCode doesn't provide an API for showing custom windows, the only way for getting these information would be to show consecutive input boxes. (using `showInputBox()`)\r\nThis means:\r\n1. The user has to remember what they have entered\r\n1. If the user remembers making a mistake in a previously validated input box, they have to cancel and start over\r\n\r\nA concrete example of such behavior can be seen in the [yo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samverschueren.yo) extension.\r\n\r\nHaving all the fields displayed simultaneously would allow the user to:\r\n1. Write AND correct themselves without having to start all over each time they make a mistake\r\n1. Have a recap of all the information that has been entered and make changes if needed\r\n\r\nSome extensions (e.g. [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vector-of-bool.cmake-tools)) are working around this limitation by:\r\n1. Showing an HTML page that contains input fields, buttons, etc. (implementing `TextDocumentContentProvider`)\r\n1. Getting the information back using an HTTP server and WebSockets\r\n1. (Perhaps, I haven't checked, but seems doable) Updating the content of the HTML page if needed\r\n\r\nClever!\r\nI think, however, that it would be better if VSCode provided some API for showing simple, custom windows that would (at least) allow getting multiple data at once.\r\n\r\nSome ideas:\r\n* `showForm([{fieldName: \"name\", fieldType: \"type\"}...], okCallback, cancelCallback)`\r\n* `showDialog(message, okCallback)`\r\n* `showFancyWindow(be, creative)`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28394","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28394/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28394/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28394/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28394","id":234957402,"number":28394,"title":"Settings tab doesn't preserve which items are expanded when switching tabs","user":{"login":"tabarra","id":1808295,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1808295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabarra","html_url":"https://github.com/tabarra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabarra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabarra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabarra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabarra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabarra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabarra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabarra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabarra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabarra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":529237263,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/settings","name":"settings","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-09T23:01:10Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T17:31:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.13.0 (376c52b955428d205459bea6619fc161fc8faacf, 2017-06-08T16:43:13.058Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.10586\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|vscode-great-icons|emmanuelbeziat|2.1.7|\r\n|php-debug|felixfbecker|1.10.0|\r\n|php-intellisense|felixfbecker|1.3.0|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

That might be a lot of features which can be implemented.\r\nFor example it might be such thinks like a: detecting list of depencies from current project or current package json, options to install all or some of dependencies from this list, detecting the deprecated packages, update all of dependecies or only some of them and etc, search in global bower register and install depencies from it , etc.\r\n\r\nI know what some plugins with same features maybe already exist, but making such tools integrated into core , with more options and features, will make vscode only better and more proffesional tool , with better user experience.\r\n\r\nThanks to the team for such good editor, i am hopefully wait for your mind's about this.
