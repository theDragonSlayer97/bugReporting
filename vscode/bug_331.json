I do this for local testing to make sure that everything works and then I deploy the updated plugins. \r\n \r\nI may at the same time update WordPress core if I feel like there is some issue with a plugin update that may be resolved by having the latest core. \r\n\r\nSo you have this giant commit of all of these changes you made.

first contribution, so the approach I took in implementing it is probably quite naive. I'm looking forward to comments and suggestions on how to improve the code. Some things I wasn't sure about:\r\n\r\n- This only implements deleting regular branches, not the remote branches, nor tags. Should those cases be handled as well? I have the feeling that removing remote branches should be handled automatically by regular purges.\r\n- I'm excluding the currently checked out branch from the list of branches to delete. For that, I used `const currentHead = this.model.HEAD && this.model.HEAD.name;` and then filtering by `ref.name !== currentHead`. I'm not sure if `this.model.HEAD` is the right way to get the current branch.\r\n- I have `const placeHolder = 'Select a branch to delete';` but saw that other strings for prompts use `localize(...)`. However, in the `git.checkout` command there is also such a `placeHolder` constant which does not use `localize` so I wasn't sure here.\r\n- In `git/src/model.ts` there is that weird `Operation` enum with bit shifting for the values. I haven't understood what the exact purpose of that is, so I just followed the pattern and added a new entry at the end.
