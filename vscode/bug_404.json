is a superb feature. But right now, in its current implementation, I think it's almost unusable. :(\r\n\r\nBecause CodeLens are lazily added to the editor, they break the code structure. You open the editor, then the lines \"jump\", and then CodeLens appear. This is not great: my eyes look at something, then everything move. It's jarring. And it can take a bit of time before they appear if the codebase is large enough.\r\n\r\nAnd it happens every time a file is opened.\r\n\r\nMoreover, even if CodeLens were not lazily added, the problem would still be here: the code structure changes because of CodeLens, and my file is visually different because of that.\r\n\r\nThat's why I think that putting CodeLens above a line is wrong.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n\r\n- The CodeLens are placed at the right of the line, instead of above (instead of using the word \"References\", an icon could lighten the interface a bit, too).\r\n- Add a marker near the line number on the left.\r\n\r\nQuick mockup:\r\n\r\n![codelens](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/478621/24495131/8134f5cc-1534-11e7-9fcd-5d45b4796376.png)\r\n\r\nThanks for considering this. :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23652/reactions","total_count":24,"+1":24,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4958","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"9B2C:2B99:1D38B1:44FD56:59D93891","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=403>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"1be01c7d4db5bcbaaab8922fc1d0bc1e\"","status":"200 OK"}}
