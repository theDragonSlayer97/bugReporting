VSCode Version: Version 1.4.0 (1.4.0)\n- OS Version: OS X/macOS 10.11.6 (15G31)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Set theme\n2. Check configuration files\n\nStoring the selected theme in the `storage.json` is a bad idea for several reasons:\n- `storage.json` seem to be meant to store temporary and local **state**.\n  - The set theme can hardly be seen as neither temporary, not local state.\n- Trying to make a sensible backup of settings is confusing, unncessarily hard, and error prone\n  - To make a sensible backup, one has to (1) backup `/Users/abc/Library/Application Support/Code/storage.json` for the theme, (2) `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/*` for the _actual_ preferences, (3) `~/.vscode/*` for extensions. Spreading these out over multiple places is not the moment of least surprise.\n  - Trying to make a sensible backup of settings can accidentally leak non-disclosable information. `storage.json` contains many file paths which potentially expose undesired information for the public. There is no easy way to just extract settings from that file that are not \"recently used files\" or \"window locations\".\n\nAdditionally, `workspaceStorage` should not be in `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User` but rather in `/Users/abc/Library/Application Support/Code`. It follows the same criteria as `/Users/abc/Library/Application Support/Code/storage.json`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10673","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10673/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10673/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10673/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10673","id":171961112,"number":10673,"title":"Can't fold long <style> tag","user":{"login":"zoulja","id":10187203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10187203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoulja","html_url":"https://github.com/zoulja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoulja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoulja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoulja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoulja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoulja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoulja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoulja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoulja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoulja/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":331200031,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-folding","name":"editor-folding","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-18T17:52:09Z","updated_at":"2016-08-18T19:49:35Z","closed_at":"2016-08-18T19:49:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![qunit](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10187203/17784667/f49dbd0a-6585-11e6-9b02-c78aec1633a2.png)\n- VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: Win 7 x64\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

I.e., no other task can be executed until the currently running task has finished. There are situations, though, were it makes sense execute a task while another one is still running. Consider the following example:\n\nI am writing a TeX document using VS Code. I have two tasks. One **build** task that runs pdflatex on my document in order to generate a pdf from my tex file. And a **show** task that opens my pdf in my pdf viewer (SumatraPDF in my case). SumatraPDF supports modifications to the currently shown pdf file while the viewer is still running. I.e., I could change my tex file and run my **build** task. SumatraPDF detects this and updates as soon as the new pdf is finished. However, as the **show** task is running until I close SumatraPDF, I cannot execute the **build** task. Being able to run **show** as a background task that does not block other tasks from being executed would solve this.\n\nI also tried to workaround this by using grunt-exec but I was not able to find a configuration that solves my use case.\n\nBest\nFrank\n\nP.S.: Thanks for this great and fast code editor!
