So I'd love a way to detect that case and turn them off (ideally only if the active editor is currently being debugged -- i.e. the debug decorations would be visible). This could probably be solved by a priority on decorations or something like that (to make sure the debug ones are higher and won't be overwritten). While that might be nice to have too, having the debug events/state feels like it could be valuable to other extensions as well.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24791","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24791/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24791/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24791/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24791","id":221858759,"number":24791,"title":"Clicking

Launch VS Code from the Dock or the Finder (NOT from the command line)\r\n2. In a terminal, run `code -w <file>`\r\n3. => file opens\r\n4. Exit VS code using <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kdb>\r\n5. => `code -w <file>` does not returns\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n`code -w <file>` should have returned.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that after VS Code is exited and even if `code -w <file>` is interrupted with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, VS Code can no longer be launched from the Finder or the Dock. Clicking on the app icon will do nothing. VS Code can however still be launched from the command line.
