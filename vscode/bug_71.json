\r\nHowever, I'm writing a simple extension and playing with interactive js shell (debug console) and I missed a keyboard shortcut to jump between text editor and panel.\r\nThe solution given in [this StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42796887/switch-focus-between-editor-and-integrated-terminal-in-visual-studio-code) is great for swapping between **integrated terminal** and code editor, but here I'm not using terminal, but debug console.\r\n\r\nSo I tried something very similar (using `ctrl+e` (but no matters)) and tried to add 2 rules like that :\r\n\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"key\": \"ctrl+e\",\r\n        \"command\": \"workbench.action.focusPanel\",\r\n        \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"key\": \"ctrl+e\",\r\n        \"command\": \"workbench.action.focusActiveEditorGroup\",\r\n        \"when\": \"!editorTextFocus\"\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this doesn't work: I can focus from the text edition to the panel, but I can't focus back. I figured out after some tests that when the focus is in panel, `editorTextFocus` is still true (in contrary to `terminalFocus`).\r\n\r\nSo, to find a solution to my problem, I need a *when clause* that let me know whether the focus is on panel or not. As far as I can see in vscode'code, I can't find any `RawContextKey` that looks like that.\r\n\r\nDid I missed something ? (I hope I didn't opened an issue for nothing)\r\nThanks !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33671","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33671/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33671/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33671/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33671","id":254610400,"number":33671,"title":"Can't see what I'm writing in the Search Widget input field","user":{"login":"lucarge","id":25553165,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/25553165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucarge","html_url":"https://github.com/lucarge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucarge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucarge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucarge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucarge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucarge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucarge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucarge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucarge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucarge/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":301186618,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/search","name":"search","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-01T11:14:31Z","updated_at":"2017-09-01T17:03:27Z","closed_at":"2017-09-01T17:03:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.15.1\r\n- OS Version: MacOS 10.12.6\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
