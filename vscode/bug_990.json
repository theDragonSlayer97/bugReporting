Take the following example (concrete feature requests are marked with a leading \"‚ù§Ô∏è\"):\n\n``` typescript\n/**\n * Add numbers!\n * @param a First number.\n * @param b Second number.\n */\nfunction add(a: number, b: number): number {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\n/**\n * This is a.\n */\nconst a = 1;\n\nconst c = add(a, 2);\n\n/**\n * This is some object.\n */\ninterface SomeObject {\n  /**\n   * This is foo.\n   */\n  foo: string;\n  /**\n   * This is bar.\n   */\n  bar: string;\n}\n\n/*\n * This is an instance of some object.\n */\nconst someObject: SomeObject = {\n  /**\n   * Test.\n   */\n  foo: 'foo',\n  bar: 'bar'\n};\n\nconst foo2 = someObject.foo;\n```\n\nAnd now let us step through each statement and look if it could be improved.\n\n**1. Function signature**\n\n``` typescript\nfunction add(a: number, b: number): number {\n```\n- Hovering over `add` shows `Add numbers!`. \n- Hovering over `a` shows `First number.`.\n- Hovering over `b` shows `Second number.`.\n\nGreat. Everything works üëç \n\n**2. Function body**\n\n``` typescript\n  return a + b;\n```\n- Hovering over `a` shows `First number.`.\n- Hovering over `b` shows `Second number.`.\n\nGreat. Everything works üëç \n\n**3. Variable declaration**\n\n``` typescript\nconst a = 1;\n```\n- Hovering over `a` shows `This is a.`.\n\nGreat. Everything works üëç \n\n**4. Function call**\n\n``` typescript\nconst c = add(a, 2);\n```\n- Hovering over `c` shows nothing.\n  - This is expected. We have no description like for `const a`.\n  - ‚ùì However... it doesn't seem we can document return values from a function call properly. Adding `* @return This is the sum.` to the `function add` documentation shows the return annotation as part of the description. But it would be nice, if hovering over `c` would show `This is the sum.` instead.\n  - If we'd add a description to `const c` like we did for `const a` (e.g. `This is c.`) _and_ we add a proper `@return` annotation to `function add` it would be nice if IntelliSense would show _both_ description when hovering over `c`: `This is c.` and `This is the sum.` (maybe with a small visual delimiter between both descriptions.).\n- Hovering over `add` shows `Add numbers!`.\n- Hovering over `a` shows `This is a.`.\n  - It would be nice, if it would also show `First number.`.\n- Hovering over `2` shows nothing.\n  - It would be nice, if it would show `Second number.`.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è  **Request 1**: It would be nice to show `@return` annotations correctly in IntelliSense.\n‚ù§Ô∏è  **Request 2**: It would be nice to _additionally_ show `@param` and `@return` annotations alongside with descriptions of variable declarations or _at least_  as a fallback, if a variable has no _own_ description.\n\n**5. Interface**\n\n``` typescript\ninterface SomeObject {\n```\n- Hovering over `SomeObject` shows `This is some object.`.\n\nGreat. Everything works üëç \n\n**6. Property in interface**\n\n``` typescript\n  foo: string;\n```\n- Hovering over `foo` shows `This is foo.`.\n\nGreat. Everything works üëç \n\n**7. Object with interface**\n\n``` typescript\nconst someObject: SomeObject = {\n```\n- Hovering over `someObject` shows nothing.\n  - I'd expect to see `This is an instance of some object.`.\n- Hovering over `SomeObject` shows `This is some object.`.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è  **Request 3**: It would be nice to show the description of an object using an interface.\n\n**8. Properties of an object with interface**\n\n``` typescript\n  foo: 'foo',\n  bar: 'bar'\n```\n- Hovering over `foo` shows `Test.`.\n  - It could also show `This is foo.`.\n- Hovering over `bar` shows nothing.\n  - It could at least show `This is bar.`.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è  **Request 4**: It would be nice to _additionally_ show property descriptions from an interface _and_ descriptions of properties in a concrete object or _at least_  as a fallback, if the property of an object has no _own_ description.\n\n**9. Using properties of an object with interface**\n\n``` typescript\nconst foo2 = someObject.foo;\n```\n- Hovering over `foo` shows `This is foo.`.\n  - It could also show `Test.`. (üí° This was very surprising for me that IntelliSense used `This is foo.` instead of `Test.` here. However... best thing would be to show both.)\n- Hovering over `foo2` shows nothing.\n  - It looks like the the type is correctly inferred and it would be nice if the descriptions could be reused here, too. (E.g. `Test.` and `This is foo.`)\n- Hovering over `someObject` shows nothing.\n  - It should show `This is an instance of some object.` (and could additionally show `This is some object.`).\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è  **Request 5**: When using properties of an object which are documented in the object itself _and_ in the interface it would be nice if the description from the object declaration could be shown (because it is probably more custom to the current use case) _or_ show both descriptions.\n‚ù§Ô∏è  **Request 6**: When types can be inferred it would be nice to infer descriptions, too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6083/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6082","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6082/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6082/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6082/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6082","id":152911375,"number":6082,"title":"Render problem under high DPI monitor","user":{"login":"chrisxvin","id":628293,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/628293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisxvin","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisxvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisxvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisxvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisxvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisxvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisxvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisxvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisxvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisxvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisxvin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-05-04T01:36:36Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T05:50:39Z","closed_at":"2016-05-04T05:50:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.1.0-insider, \n- OS Version: Win10 Pro\n\nI got two different text render styles, one is blurry, and another is clear.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/628293/15003152/68b30c4e-11db-11e6-961d-c06e76d8ebba.png)\n\nYou can see middle window is more blurry than both left and right window.\nMy monitor size is 13 inches, with 1920x1080 resolution.
