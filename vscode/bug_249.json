Open a JavaScript project in a workspace. (Was unable to reproduce in a typescript and go project. But verified in 2 different javascript projects).\r\n2. Open a file using 2 spaces for indentation. Hit Cmd-S for <save>. The file reformats to 4 spaces.\r\n\r\nWhen I open the file, the indent guides are at 2 stops. The status bar says `Spaces: 2`. But hitting save reformats the code to 4 spaces. Happens with eslint enabled and disabled. No workspace settings. Global setting has `files.formatOnSave` as `off` by default and `editor.tabSize` as `2`. This has started happening recently after updating to the latest version.\r\n\r\nIf I reopen the file now, the status bar says `Spaces: 4` with 4 spaces in indent guides. Now I select `Indent using Spaces` > `2`, and `Reindent Lines`. This restores the 2 spaces formatting. But hitting save again turns the 2 spaces into 4.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28326","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28326/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28326/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28326/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28326","id":234778707,"number":28326,"title":"Discard
