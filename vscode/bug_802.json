Type Table and hit tab\n2. Type tr and hit tab\n\nWhat used to happen is the cursor would be placed in between the tr tags `<tr>cursor would be here</tr>` after hitting the tab key on a tr or td tag.  Since the last update, it now goes to the end of the line which isn't too aggravating if you have just the tr and nothing else.  It become aggravating when you have something like this:\n\n`<td><input type=\"text\" name=\"something\" id=\"something\" value=\"something\"></td>`\n\nLet's say you forgot to change or want to add some styles to the td tag.  \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Go into the td tag and hit space just after the 'd' in 'td'\n2. Type 'style' and hit tab\n\nInstead of placing the cursor inside the style tag `style=\"cursor goes here\"`, you end up with:\n\n`<td style=\"\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"something\"

Upgraded VSCode to 1.5.0\n3. Now, once I select an icon theme like Seti it appears there are conflicts with the old icon set from the vscode-icons extension. I tried uninstalling the extension, terminating all instances of VSCode and restarting, but still see artifacts as you can see below:\n   - The **Open Editors** window uses the old icons, but the actual project shows the new icon set from the included Seti theme\n   - The colored folders still appear in the project view... the preview of the Seti them seemed to not have folders... this look to come from the old extension\n   - Indentation of items seems off... the files in the root of the project are nested under folders\n   - Indentation of items within folders seems to be extremely duped... for instance in below image, the file `build.ts` resides in `/build/gulp/tasks` while `buildBarrel.ts` resides in `/build/gulp`\n\n![2016-09-08_15-41-32](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2068657/18364157/5660e8b8-75db-11e6-888d-ae8749863474.png)\n\nTried finding a place where icons were cached, but can't find anything... searched the `/users/[]/.vscode/*` folder... ensuring the extension was really gone which it is.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11704","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11704/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11704/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11704/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11704","id":175844099,"number":11704,"title":"Intellisense in comments disrupts flow","user":{"login":"geoffreyfloyd","id":5149575,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5149575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyfloyd","html_url":"https://github.com/geoffreyfloyd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyfloyd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyfloyd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyfloyd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyfloyd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyfloyd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyfloyd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyfloyd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyfloyd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoffreyfloyd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":291055694,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/typescript","name":"typescript","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-09-08T19:38:13Z","updated_at":"2016-09-11T16:59:19Z","closed_at":"2016-09-09T15:26:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.5.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro, Version 1511, Build 10586.545\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
