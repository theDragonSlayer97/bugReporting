Essentially, the extension needs platform-specific native binaries in order to function (both for debugging support and OmniSharp for language server support). It does this by acquiring the binaries during the extension's first activation, rather than during installation. So, the user experience for installation is a bit awkward:\n1. Install C# Extension\n2. VS Code prompts to restart after successful installation\n3. User restarts VS Code and opens a C# project\n4. User waits after the \"installed\" extension finishes installing itself by acquiring native dependencies\n\nTo make matters worse, in order to acquire the native dependencies, the extension essentially has to copy code from VS Code in order to handle HTTP proxies correctly (see

always want markdown word-wrapped wrapped. I never want most other files wrapped. So I find myself switching back and forth all the time.\n\nIt seems like there is already some document-type specific configuration for html, e.g.\n\n```\n// Maximum amount of characters per line (0 = disable).\n\"html.format.wrapLineLength\": 120,\n```\n\nThe universal setting is named differently:\n\n```\n\"editor.wrappingColumn\": 300,\n```\n\nIt would be great if this convention were just standardized and applicable to any document type, and I could use `markdown.format.wrappingColumn` (or possibly any other known doc type, though I mostly just care about markdown) to control this per type.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6925/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6924","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6924/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6924/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6924/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6924","id":157008371,"number":6924,"title":"Cmd+C/Ctrl+C
