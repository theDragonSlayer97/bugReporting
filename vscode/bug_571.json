Call `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().update('someOtherSetting', value);` to update another configuration value on disk.\r\n3. Immediately call `vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.reloadWindow');` to trigger window reload.\r\n4. Notice only first setting gets updated.\r\n\r\nThe reason seems to be that the app doesn't wait for the `queue` to get flushed before reloading.\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is to introduce a delay before reloading in order for the updates to get persisted on disk.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18659","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18659/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18659/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18659/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18659","id":201280583,"number":18659,"title":"git commit and scrolling issues in integrated terminal","user":{"login":"johandalabacka","id":9607173,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9607173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johandalabacka","html_url":"https://github.com/johandalabacka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johandalabacka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johandalabacka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johandalabacka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johandalabacka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johandalabacka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johandalabacka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johandalabacka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johandalabacka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johandalabacka/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-17T13:18:44Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T22:53:54Z","closed_at":"2017-01-17T22:53:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.8.1 (ee428b0eead68bf0fb99ab5fdc4439be227b6281, 2016-12-19T14:42:49.304Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.0.0\r\n- Extensions:\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf I have vi as default git commit editor and does a commit will the integrated terminal scroll to the top instead of staying at the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. git commit\r\n2.

VSCode Version:\r\n\r\nVersion 1.9.0-insider\r\nCommit 2cdc2b3da8f0fd5322b48747241584cf9dd98f8f\r\nDate 2017-01-13T07:03:18.620Z\r\nShell 1.4.6\r\nRenderer 53.0.2785.143\r\nNode 6.5.0\r\n\r\n- OS Version:\r\n\r\nUbuntu 14.04\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Type something that triggers auto complete\r\n2. Press up & down arrow. Press pagup & pagedown. In both cases, focus moves within the auto suggestions dialog\r\n3. Now press home/end, the auto complete dialog closes & the cursor moves to the start of the line. Instead the first/last item in the auto suggest needs to be selected in the dialog without closing the auto suggest window.\r\n\r\n#### Why should the implementation for Home/End buttons needs to be changed?\r\n\r\n1. Because the user was interested in narrowing down the auto suggest results by pressing `up`/`down`/`pgup`/`pgdn`/the key combination that triggers auto suggestions `ctrl+space`. So we should assume that he would be interested in moving within the autosuggest dialog when he presses either `home`/`end` after he presses any of the key combinations mentioned above\r\n\r\n2. IntelliJ implementation is along similar lines\r\n\r\n#### Suggestion on the implementation of handling Home/End.\r\n\r\n1. If the user starts typing & auto suggest window automatically opens up, `home`/`end` will take the user to start/end of the line in the editor after closing the dialog (the current behaviour)\r\n2. If the `home`/`end` buttons are pressed after user presses `up`/`down`/`pgup`/`pgdn`/`ctrl+space` keys, the subsequent `home`/`end` buttons should move the focus within the dialog, not in the
