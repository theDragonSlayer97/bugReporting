Open a large file or create one\r\n2. Use these settings: \r\n\r\n ```\r\n    \"atomKeymap.promptV3Features\": true,\r\n    \"editor.multiCursorModifier\": \"ctrlCmd\",\r\n    \"editor.formatOnPaste\": true,\r\n    \"editor.fontSize\": 14,\r\n    \"editor.wordWrap\": \"on\",\r\n    \"editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter\": \"off\",\r\n    \"workbench.activityBar.visible\": true,\r\n    \"terminal.external.osxExec\": \"iterm.app\",\r\n    \"window.zoomLevel\": 1,\r\n    \"workbench.sideBar.location\": \"left\",\r\n    \"workbench.statusBar.visible\": true,\r\n    \"extensions.ignoreRecommendations\": false,\r\n    \"editor.dragAndDrop\": false,\r\n    \"editor.links\": false,\r\n    \"bracketPairColorizer.forceUniqueOpeningColor\": true,\r\n    \"bracketPairColorizer.forceIterationColorCycle\": true,\r\n    \"bracketPairColorizer.consecutivePairColors\": [\r\n        ...\r\n    ],\r\n    \"editor.fontFamily\": \"Input\",\r\n    \"editor.fontWeight\": \"100\",\r\n    \"editor.wrappingIndent\": \"indent\",\r\n    \"editor.wordWrapColumn\": 100\r\n```\r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\nHere's an image that illustrates the inconsistencies (sorry I had to block some things out):\r\n[Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/txkGPe6.jpg)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, all the things at the bottom of the editor are wrapping and indenting correctly, but many lines above are wrapping and not indenting at all. Sometimes they wrap, sometimes they don't. It's even more inconsistent (and impossible to work with) if I have the file explorer open (can provide another screenshot if needed, but honestly, it's impossible to tell what's going on as indentation is so all over the place).\r\n\r\nThis happens whether I have editor.wrappingIndent set to indent or same, and without extensions loaded. It's very frustrating and can make some files a huge PITA to edit (it seems that after about 5 indentations things get weird, and almost everything I'm working with is in the 8-20 indentation range).\r\n\r\nEdit: after playing around, it seems the wrappingIndent definitely breaks at 10 indents every time, but the presence of anything over 9 indents seems to cause the weird inconsistencies with other lines/indent amounts. This, again, becomes painfully hard to deal with if the file explorer is

If using Activity Monitor, observe the number of open files by CodeHelper (gets up to around 9k before crashing the log.)\r\n3. Observe other programs failing.
