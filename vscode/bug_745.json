currently come from two curated lists. The first is one we want to keep, we call them **important recommendations** and only essential extensions exist within; these recommendations appear as popus to the user. The second one is an ever growing list of _not-so-important_ extensions, which appear only in the `@recommended` list. We want to replace curation by dynamically querying the Marketplace.\n\ncc @seanmcbreen @waderyan \n## \n\nWe still have to look into whether the tagging currently in place gives us acceptable results. The tagging currently running by [`vsce`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-vsce/blob/master/src/package.ts#L213) and run as a background task in the Marketplace creates hidden tags `__ext_${EXTENSION}` for extensions. We can then [query for them ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=tag%3A__ext_md&target=VSCode&sortBy=Relevance)as users open said files. Eg: if the user opens a `.js` file, we'd search for extensions tagged with the `__ext_js` keyword.\n\nLet's take our current curated suggestions and see whether they would show up given this strategy. Make sure you scroll right to see the full data.\n\n| Recommendation | Files | Current | Next |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ms-vscode.csharp | `**/*.cs,**/project.json,**/global.json,**/*.csproj,**/*.sln` | 5 | 1 |\n| ms-vscode.mono-debug | `**/*.cs,**/*.csproj,**/*.sln` | 3 | 0 |\n| msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome | `**/*.ts,**/*.tsx**/*.js,**/*.jsx,**/*.es6` | 5 | 0 |\n| lukehoban.Go | `**/*.go` | 1 | 1 |\n| ms-vscode.PowerShell | `**/*.ps,**/*.ps1` | 2 | 0 |\n| austin.code-gnu-global | `**/*.c,**/*.cpp,**/*.h` | 3 | 0 |\n| Ionide.Ionide-fsharp | `**/*.fsx,**/*.fsi,**/*.fs,**/*.ml,**/*.mli` | 5 | 3 |\n| dbaeumer.vscode-eslint | `**/*.js,**/*.jsx,**/*.es6` | 3 | 0 |\n| eg2.tslint | `**/*.ts,**/*.tsx` | 2 | 0 |\n| Kasik96.format-indent | `**/*.php` | 1 | 0 |\n| felixfbecker.php-debug | `**/*.php` | 1 | 0 |\n| linyang95.phpmd | `**/*.php` | 1 | 0 |\n| ikappas.phpcs | `**/*.php` | 1 | 0 |\n| tht13.python | `**/*.py` | 1 | 1 |\n| donjayamanne.python | `**/*.py` | 1 | 0 |\n| magicstack.MagicPython | `**/*.py` | 1 | 1 |\n| saviorisdead.RustyCode | `**/*.rs,**/*.rslib` | 2 | 1 |\n| hars.CppSnippets | `**/*.cpp,**/*.cc,**/*.h` | 3 | 0 |\n| mitaki28.vscode-clang | `**/*.cpp,**/*.cc,**/*.h` | 3 | 0 |\n| ms-vscode.cpptools | `**/*.c,**/*.cpp,**/*.cc,**/.cxx,**/*.hh,**/*.hpp,**/*.hxx,**/*.h` | 8 | 0 |\n| seanmcbreen.Spell | `**/*.md` | 1 | 0 |\n| ms-vscode.Theme-MarkdownKit | `**/*.md` | 1 | 0 |\n| DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint | `**/*.md` | 1 | 0 |\n| PeterJausovec.vscode-docker | `**/dockerfile,**/Dockerfile,**/docker-compose.yml,**/docker-compose.*.yml` | 5 | 0 |\n|  |  | 60 | 8 |\n\nIn the third column you'll find the number of triggers per recommended extension. A trigger is a file name/extension which we currently use to recommend that extension. For example, `foo.js` triggers the extension `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`. There are a total of 60 triggers in our current curated list.\n\nUsing the `__ext_` keywords, only 8 of those would actually work. That's 13%. This happens because most of these extensions are not tagged with the corresponding keywords based on the file extensions we recommend them from. For example, `msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome` doesn't specify anything about `.js` files in its manifest.\n\nThen there's the additional problem of queries returning too many extensions. The query for the `__ext_h` keyword alone returns 359 results. Sorting that query by [downloads](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=tag%3A__ext_h&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Downloads) or by [rating](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=tag%3A__ext_h&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Rating) doesn't seem to help much in narrowing which extensions really are _recommendable_.\n\nFinally, imagining that the `__ext_` keyword queries return a healthy collection of extensions, we need to figure out how to sort that collection and where is the cut-off point between a recommended extension and simply a popular one.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13414","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13414/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13414/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13414/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13414","id":181979247,"number":13414,"title":"Emmet completion doesn't work after button with (click) event in typescript with Angular 2.0","user":{"login":"Nikki1993","id":1446529,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1446529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikki1993","html_url":"https://github.com/Nikki1993","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikki1993/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikki1993/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikki1993/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikki1993/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikki1993/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikki1993/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikki1993/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikki1993/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikki1993/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":479976993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/emmet","name":"emmet","color":"c2e0c6","default":false},{"id":427411234,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/extension-candidate","name":"extension-candidate","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":256129996,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"fef2c0","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":9,"created_at":"2016-10-10T10:13:25Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T00:05:25Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.5.3 && Same behaviour is seen on the latest Insider Build dated 10.10.2016.\n- OS Version: macOS 10.12\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
