VSCode Version: Version 1.5.0-insider (1.5.0-insider) || Version 1.4.0 (1.4.0)\n- OS Version: OSX El Captain 10.11.6\n\nI had a project on my Macbook where the intelisense was working perfectly, then my Macbook has been sent for repair and in the meantime I am using a different one. I have cloned the project I was working on, did an `npm i` and `typings i`, then downloaded VSCode and I was ready to rock, but sadly intelisense doesn't work at all. (No code completion on imports, no go to definition, nothing.) With the very same vscode version (installed before) and same project codebase revision on my colleague Mac it works well. And with a freshly installed vscode insider too.\n\nI know its not enough for a bug report, but sadly this is all I can tell, there are no errors, it just doesn't work for me while works for others for the very same codebase.\n\n\"Reinstall\" doesn't help and there is no error in the console.\n\nWhat other info should I provide to make this bug solvable?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10537","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10537/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10537/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10537/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10537","id":171137329,"number":10537,"title":"Quick
