Use \"attach\" to attach to a mocha debugging process run using `--compilers js:babel-core/register`\n\nI guessed this is related to `launch.json` parsing based on [https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3625] but I can't seem to work around it. I had \n\n```\n\"outDir\": null\n```\n\nbefore (since it's not relevant when I attach to a mocha debugging process, as the code is compiled JIT and there is no outDir). There was a complaint in the IDE about it, so I changed it. Still getting the error. I don't have any other warnings in `launch.json` so I'm at a loss as to how to work around it. \n\n```\n        \"name\": \"Attach\",\n        \"type\": \"node\",\n        \"request\": \"attach\",\n        \"port\": 5858,\n        \"sourceMaps\": true,\n        \"outDir\": \"${workspaceRoot}/dist\"\n```\n\nI saw a suggestion to look at the \"dev tools console\" in VS Code to see a stack trace of the source of the problem from the linked issue above. I can't find any \"dev tools console\" in either the menus, and couldn't find anything by googling it. If you can tell me how to access this I can provide more info.\n\n_Update_\n\nI regenerated `launch.json` from scratch to be sure my old config wasn't invalid. Same problem.

if you click to close one of the tabs which is _not the currently focused one_, the expected close events never trigger for the closed document.\n\nThe expected behavior is that the `onDidClose` or `onDidCloseTextDocument` events would trigger depending on whether or not one is using full or incremental synchronization. But if the tab which is closed is not focused first, the event never fires.\n\nA practical consequence of this is that I use the close events to clear diagnostics, so if the user closes the tab for a non-focused document, the diagnostic messages are not cleared.\n\nNote that this describes what happens with `vscode-languageserver-node` in my own extension, but based on observations of similar extensions which do not use the language server, the same issue occurs (e.g., diagnostics not cleared properly without focusing first).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13362","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13362/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13362/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13362/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13362","id":181724989,"number":13362,"title":"Find and Replace dialog covers content","user":{"login":"cparker4486","id":1189638,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1189638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cparker4486","html_url":"https://github.com/cparker4486","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cparker4486/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cparker4486/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cparker4486/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cparker4486/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cparker4486/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cparker4486/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cparker4486/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cparker4486/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cparker4486/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-10-07T17:27:32Z","updated_at":"2016-10-07T19:22:20Z","closed_at":"2016-10-07T17:53:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.5.3\n- OS Version: Win 10 1607\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Have content as long as the window is wide in the first three lines of the window\n2. Display the Find and Replace dialog\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1189638/19198376/b739d95c-8c73-11e6-9e0d-e9b0a6335cbb.png)\n\nIn some cases, like mine above, this dialog covers the content and there's no way to change that except to make changes to the content itself by adding additional empty lines at the top.\n\nScrolling doesn't work and neither does changing the size of the window. The content will always be covered. Additionally, stepping through matches doesn't help because the dialog doesn't move out of the way when a match is found underneath it.\n\nWhat's my preferred fix? I think a good solution is to model the control after Sublime Text's implementation. In ST's case, a single row dialog slides up from the bottom of the window. If it covers a line of text at the bottom, the content becomes scrollable which allows the user to scroll the content up. Similarly, stepping through the matches will make them visible because doing that repositions the content not the dialog.\n\nI recognize that my preferred fix completely changes the UI which might be too much to accept for the dev team and some users. (Even though I think it would be a net positive change.)\n\nHere are some other possible fixes I came up with.\n1. Display the dialog in the same place but shift the content itself down a maximum of three lines.\n2. Move the dialog down up to three lines if it covers matches. If it _still_ covers matches (on lines 4,5,6) then move the dialog one line at a time when stepping through the matches. Move the dialog progressively downard, up to three lines, when stepping forward. Move the dialog back up, up to three lines, when coming from below the dialog while stepping backward. In other words, push the dialog in the direction the user is moving through the matches.\n\nThere are certainly other options out there but I've spent too much time on this at this point. :)\n\nThank you for your consideration!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13361","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13361/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13361/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13361/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13361","id":181718480,"number":13361,"title":"VS Code keeps displaying info alert: \"The workspace folder contains TypeScript version 2.0.3.\" even though I removed TypeScript from my project","user":{"login":"alejandroiglesias","id":480640,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/480640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandroiglesias","html_url":"https://github.com/alejandroiglesias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandroiglesias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandroiglesias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandroiglesias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandroiglesias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandroiglesias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandroiglesias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandroiglesias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandroiglesias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandroiglesias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291055694,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/typescript","name":"typescript","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-10-07T16:54:06Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T14:47:28Z","closed_at":"2016-10-11T14:47:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.5.3\n- OS Version: OS X El Capitan 10.11.6\n\nSteps to Reproduce: not sure how to reproduce, I started using VS Code with this project while having TypeScript.

we support having a `preLaunchTask` specified in 'launch.json' to run a task before a user starts debugging (more details [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)). There are [requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10211) that we support running a `preLaunchTask` even if a user does not have 'tasks.json' setup.\n\nMy proposal for this is that the user could specify a full command in his 'launch.json' which we would just forward to our terminal via the `send` api. The only missing piece for this would be for the terminal to be aware when a command has finished running - or when it becomes idle. Currently this problem is solved in the task framewrok by @dbaeumer so maybe we could do something similar in our terminal.\n\nI think @jrieken might be also interested in something similar for the
