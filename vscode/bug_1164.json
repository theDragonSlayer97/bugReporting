There is one thing still bugging me when coming from Sublime that I think could be added, at least as an option. Currently Go code completion for methods and functions stops after the name is expanded:\n\n```\nstrconv.AppendF<tab>  ->  strconv.AppendFloat\n```\n\nIn sublime, the behaviour would have been:\n\n```\nstrconv.AppendF<tab>  ->  strconv.AppendFloat(dst, f, fmt, prec, bitSize)\n```\n\n<img width=\"710\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-12-01 at 12 44 56\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/125426/11499846/617e59be-9829-11e5-97dd-b8e0ddee6789.png\">\n\nwith \"dst\" being selected for overwrite if I continued typing, and tab moving to the \"f\" parameter and so on. This is enormously helpful when you don't immediately remember the parameters or their order, as in this example that takes a lot of them... It's also great when you've just refactored out the method and are going to call it from the original site, as the parameters are probably already named correctly.\n\nCurrently the workarounds are to type the parens manually, then go back and hit Ctrl-Space for the completion result again. However, it cuts off long parameter lists:\n\n<img width=\"1051\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-12-01 at 12 40 05\"

work to parse than just getting the params immediately up front:\n\n<img width=\"1053\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-12-01 at 12 38 39\"

`go.completeWithParameters` option or something.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/856","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/856/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/856/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/856/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/856","id":119699015,"number":856,"title":"Run
