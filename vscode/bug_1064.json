just did a quick check on the command pallet and can navigate it just fine. I can read the actions, but it seems the shortcut keys assigned to these actions aren't read aloud by screenreaders. Obviously I can't verify if this is just me having a lot of commands with no keyboard shortcuts attached. Can anyone confirm?\nAlso, pressing escape dismisses the pallet but doesn't take your focus back to the editor. I think although focus stealing is usually frowned upon, in this case it would smooth out the interaction somewhat since you do hop to the command pallet by pressing f1, but have to use browse mode or tab + shift+tab to get back to where you were after it has been dismissed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3838","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3838/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3838/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3838/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3838","id":139267829,"number":3838,"title":"VS
