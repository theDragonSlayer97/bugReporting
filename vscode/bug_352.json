looks very strange that VS Code doesn't support ability to create and use projects. Workspace settings is a project settings. It's projects support already in this editor. But requires some polishing...\r\n\r\nI found it uncomfortable for me to create new `.vscode` folder inside the source code directory. Some extensions put there own cache files. I don't like it (because if I work vis sshfs, then it means that each change of this cache file will be transferred, that I don't like to do).\r\n\r\nIt's why I propose to tune-up current workspace ideology and enable out-of-the-box projects support. All what you need - to create for each new project new folder in the `~/.vscode/` with appropriate local workspace `settings.json` file.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it will look like this:\r\n```bash\r\n~/.vscode/\r\n    settings.json\r\n    project1/\r\n        settings.json\r\n        cache_file_for_some_plugin\r\n    project2/\r\n        settings.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis structure will work fine, because you have the same global setting for all projects, and local settings per project (workspace).\r\n\r\nIt will be good if you will make this change, and it will make life much easier out-of-the box.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25240","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25240/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25240/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25240/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25240","id":223900128,"number":25240,"title":"Very
