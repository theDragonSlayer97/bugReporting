PR implements @avih's the feature-request from issue #10268.\n### What has changed?\n- new configuration setting `git.countUntracked`, default is `false`\n- the blue 'change count badge' on the git icon in the main sidebar ignores untracked files if `git.countUntracked` is `true`\n### New Configuration Setting\n\nThe new setting does not affect the default behaviour of the change count badge as it is off by default, meaning both tracked and untracked files are counted. Untracked files are only ignored if `git.countUntracked` is set to `true` in the user or workspace preferences.\n### Other Changes to `gitWorkbenchContribution.ts`\n- import `IConfigurationService` in order to read the `countUntracked` config\n- in `StatusUpdater`: add private member `configurationService`\n- in `StatusUpdater.showChangesBadge()`: use a different callback for `map` depending on `countUntracked`\n### In Action\n\n![git-ignore-untracked

am [currently exploring the options](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns-vscode) of using VS Code to build a debugger for an actor-based language.\n\nOne of the things that are key for the project are custom and often complex types of breakpoints.\nIn our [current prototype](https://vimeo.com/161942246), we support for instance the following types of breakpoints:\n\n<img width=\"250\" alt=\"Breakpoint on async-send operator\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnrVradWcAAI9r-.jpg\">\n\nOn the asynchronous message send operator, we can set a sender side or a receiver side breakpoint.\n\n<img width=\"307\" alt=\"breakpoint on methods, only triggered by asynchronous messages\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40815/17604319/95e0b2b0-6015-11e6-9227-e106664d6c8a.png\">\n\nOn method definitions, we can set breakpoints that are only triggered when that method is activated via an asynchronous message (but not when it is called synchronously).\n\nSince this is probably far from a common requirement, I would also be more than happy with some recommendations of how I could prototype this myself.\n\nWhile we have popovers in our prototype, the context menu might do (however, the 'when' clause in package.json does not seem to be taking callbacks for custom predicates?). A custom indicator/handle to interact with the breakpoint might still be nice (I think the decorator-sample comes with code that I can probably adapt).\nAnd when the breakpoint is set, it needs to be communicated to the process that's debugged, but I'll probably be able to extend the debugging protocol to my needs.\nSo, I think, it should be possible for me to prototype something, but I'd be very grateful for guidelines and perhaps pointers to the most relevant elements that I should be aware of.\n\nThanks\nStefan\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10446","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10446/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10446/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10446/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10446","id":170727377,"number":10446,"title":"workspace.asRelativePath
