modern editors that have tabs have options like \"Close all to the right / left\" or \"Close all but this...\" so you can close multiple files at once. The same can be added to the working files list. Right-click on a file and we should see options like \"Close all files above\", \"Close all files below\", and \"Close all files but this one\". I often organize files in tabs (or in the Working files list in the case of VS Code) according to function within the app I am working on. For instance, I may have a user view, user controller and user model open followed by login view, login controller and login model files. If I no longer need to refer to the login files, I could simply right-click the user model and select \"Close all files below\" rather than closing each login related file individually. I do this frequently throughout the day regardless of the project I am working on and I am sure this feature would be beneficial to others as well as it is an easy way to quickly clean up the working files list if you have many
