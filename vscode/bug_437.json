VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

Open putty and ssh into a remote linux box (e.g. ubuntu)\r\n4. Open a text editor on the remote box (e.g. nano) and paste the text - all empty lines are gone\r\n\r\nThis is because vscode (unlike most other editors on Windows e.g. Sublime) does not convert line endings to the platform's native line ending format when placing text in to the clipboard. As a result other Windows programs (like putty) have problems working with it.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround (I have found) is to temporarily change the line-endings to CRLF, copy the text and then change them back to LF.

writing JavaScript, double clicking symbols that start a string highlights both the symbols and the single or double quote to the left of it.

probably a bad thing I found the support request for VS code haha.\r\n\r\nSo I have this problem where when working with very long functions, I click on the closing bracket and I don't know what function that is. So I will hover over the indent guide and scroll up, until I run into the opening bracket to figure out what it is. It might be an object for example. Also applies to `<div>` tags. Anything \"out of view\" of the coding pane.\r\n\r\nRegarding the hover-highlight on the indent guide, that would be a cool feature if you could hover on the indent guides and highlight them (along side with the feature above).\r\n\r\nThe highlighting part might be redundant/unnecessary if you can show the opening tag name so you don't have to trace by scrolling upwards.\r\n\r\nIf this has already been addressed, my apologies.\r\n\r\nAttached is an image to show the rough functionality.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22675/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22674","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22674/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22674/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22674/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22674","id":214440673,"number":22674,"title":"vscode

Running the Windows version of Code from bash on Windows using WSL works really well. The problem with the set-up is that the language server and extension environment in code is using the Windows environment, but the terminal is using the WSL environment. These are essentially two different operating systems, different executables installed and configured.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to be able to configure VSCode on Windows to fork all processes using WSL (bash) rather than the native Windows command shell. This applies to language servers and other extensions.
