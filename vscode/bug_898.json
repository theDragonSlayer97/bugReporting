errors returned from the `sourceRequest` are only visible on the dev console.\n\nFor that reason the sourceRequest implementation of node-debug manufactures content that contains the error message and returns success. \n\nI've cleaned that up and now node-debug returns proper errors.\n\nFor the UI we have these option:\n1. workbench error notification\n2. manufacturing an editor content for the error and showing this in the editor\n3. having a '404'-like error page instead misusing an editor for that.\n\nOption 1 is too heavy because the user has to dismiss the notification.\nOption 2 is what we have today but implemented on the 'correct' side.\nOption 3 would be the best solution.\n\nFor now 2 is fine by me, but we should involve UX to design something for
