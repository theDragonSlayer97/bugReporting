VSCode Version: 1.13.0\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nVSCode's undo behaviour seems unusually coarse and not in line with how other editing experiences work. Often I accidentally hit the wrong key while something is selected and accidentally overwrite what I'd written. Then when I hit undo, it undoes not only what I just did, but a whole lot of what I'd done previously. Undo is supposed to save the user from these sorts of problems.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Type some words\r\n2. Delete the last word\r\n3. Type some more words\r\n4. Decide you don't like your change and hit undo\r\n\r\nThe entire sentence vanishes.\r\n\r\n**Undo stops should occur (roughly) in the following scenarios:**\r\n\r\n- When starting a new destructive operation (backspace, delete, cut, etc.) after a constructive operation (typing, pasting, other insertion scenarios).\r\n- The inverse of the above; starting a new constructive operation after a destructive operation.\r\n- Between different classes of destructive or constructive edit - for example if I backspace a few times, removing characters left of the cursor, and then use the delete key, removing characters to the right of the cursor, I'd expect an undo stop to occur when the delete key is first pressed.\r\n- Starting to navigate and/or select text with the cursor after any kind of edit, or starting an edit operation after navigating with the cursor.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29036/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29035","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29035/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29035/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29035/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29035","id":236967665,"number":29035,"title":"Latest VSCode insider doesn't start and outputs error \"TypeError: Cannot read property 'reopenFolders' of undefined\"","user":{"login":"clguimanMSFT","id":22645093,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/22645093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clguimanMSFT","html_url":"https://github.com/clguimanMSFT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clguimanMSFT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clguimanMSFT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clguimanMSFT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clguimanMSFT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clguimanMSFT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clguimanMSFT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clguimanMSFT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clguimanMSFT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clguimanMSFT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-06-19T17:43:58Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T22:02:04Z","closed_at":"2017-06-20T05:35:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.14.0\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.15063\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nJust installed latest insider build and I can't start the app anymore.

so my guess is that debugger is trying attach second instance over same port as first one...\r\n\r\nhow to reproduce:\r\n1. create base extension (yo code)\r\n2. edit extension.ts:\r\n```ts\r\nimport * as vscode from 'vscode';\r\nimport { fork } from 'child_process';\r\nexport function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {\r\n    context.subscriptions.push(vscode.commands.registerCommand('command-name', command));\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction command() {\r\n    const forkArgs = [];\r\n    const forkScript = path.join(path.dirname(module.filename), 'forkScript.js');\r\n    const process = fork(forkScript, forkArgs, { cwd: vscode.workspace.rootPath, silent: true });\r\n    \r\n    process.stderr.on('data', data => {\r\n       // here i get 'Could not bind socket' \r\n    });\r\n    process.on('exit', code => {\r\n        // if 'Could not bind socket' => never hit this\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    process.on('message', data => {\r\n        // do something with data ...\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    // start work\r\n    process.send(args);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. and add forkScript.ts:\r\n```ts\r\nprocess.on('message', processArgs => {\r\n   console.log('im here'); // ok\r\n   const result = blackBox(processArgs);\r\n   console.log('im here'); // never hit\r\n   process.send(result);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n4. modify package.json to be able execute created command \r\n5. start debug of newly created extension\r\n6. execute create command - it will start new debugger in [Extension Development Host] window\r\n7. first console.log works, but when inside `blackBox()` it send me 'Could not bind socket error' and kills itself without calling process.on('exit')\r\n\r\nPS: when i install extension via VSIX, open vscode and run that command it will attach and debug tru `blackBox` function successfully.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29028","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29028/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29028/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29028/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29028","id":236938091,"number":29028,"title":"Not able to install extension in visual studio code","user":{"login":"Majid-Khosh","id":12999646,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12999646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Majid-Khosh","html_url":"https://github.com/Majid-Khosh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Majid-Khosh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Majid-Khosh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Majid-Khosh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Majid-Khosh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Majid-Khosh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Majid-Khosh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Majid-Khosh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Majid-Khosh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Majid-Khosh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-19T15:54:11Z","updated_at":"2017-09-01T15:01:17Z","closed_at":"2017-09-01T15:01:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I installed the latest version of VS Code on Windows 8.1.\r\nI have the same error in both home and university .

were before going back\r\n\r\nExample: Exploring code\r\n\r\n1. click into a line\r\n2. click 3 lines below\r\n3. click 3 lines below\r\n4. jump back\r\n\r\n=> you end up not in the original line from 1. but in the one from 2.\r\n\r\nBoth issues can be solved by smartly merging a history entry with the current position if it does not qualify for a new location.\r\n\r\n/cc @egamma
