have been unable to find any information on whether or not vs code has any plans to support the functionality to allow extensions to create new activity bar items and/or side bar panels. \r\n\r\nWould be useful for creating many types of extensions (team chat, project/time management, sql explorers, cli tool integration (docker, npm, composer, webpack, vagrant, etc...), even less obvious things like music players and documentation). I'm aware that a lot of these extensions exist, but they aren't easily accessible (open command palette, search for extension, select option, enter command...). \r\n\r\nThis type of functionality would potentially allow myself and many other developers to work in vs code without ever having to open another tool or leave the editor. \r\n\r\nIf this is something that would be considered, I would be willing to work on it.
