given you (bpasero) access to my private repo.  https://github.com/a11smiles/azure-orchestrator\n\nI’m developing on Windows 10.  It’s an Electron app built with Angular2 & Typescript.  `npm start` will run gulp which deletes and rebuilds the `dist` subfolder.  The `dist` folder has 3 distros of the app in its output subfolder – Linux, OSX, Windows.  Each one of these folders has a `resources` subfolder that contains an .asar file.\n\nI’ve added the `dist` folder to my ignored folders in VSCode in hopes that code would just ignore the whole folder.  While the `dist` folder no longer shows up in the list of folders in VSCode, there’s still a lock placed on the .asar files.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1)      In the main folder: `npm start`\n2)      Let it build\n3)      Open VSCode on the folder: `code .`\n4)      Wait a minute or two\n5)      Now, with VSCode still open on the folder, attempt to build again: ‘npm start’\n6)      You should get an error saying that gulp could not delete the `dist` folder due to VSCode having locks on the .asar files\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13075","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13075/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13075/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13075/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13075","id":180287290,"number":13075,"title":"Markdown

noticed `watermark.ts` and `watermark.css` in `vs/workbench/parts/watermark` which comes with some issues:\n- first of all there should be a parent folder for those that outlines the target execution environment (see https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Code-Organization). just take a look how other parts do it\n- then, parts is typically a contribution to the workbench and no code from vs/workbench should depend on it (see https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Code-Organization#workbench-parts)\n\nI suggest to rewrite the watermark to be a workbench extension (such as `UpdateContribution` in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/update/electron-browser/update.contribution.ts#L38) and do it all cleanly via services.\n\nTo get access to the editor container HTML element I suggest to add a new method to the `IPartService` (which `workbench.ts` implements) to return the HTML element for a given part (e.g. `getContainer(partId)`).\n\nI can help you out in case of questions 👍

Open a large-ish C/CPP file in the editor (couple thousand lines).  \n4. Run the build task.\n5. Watch as the build task fills up the output window and starts to scroll, the text in the above editor will increment line by line with the task output buffer filling.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13054","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13054/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13054/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13054/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13054","id":180189656,"number":13054,"title":"URL
