Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n# Language Capabilities and URI schemas\r\n\r\n## Current situation\r\n\r\nDocuments in VS Code are currently classified using two dimensions:\r\n\r\n- the language mode: It determines the programming language used. Examples are: TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, ...\r\n- the document source, expressed using the schema of the documents URIs. Examples are: file, inmemory, untitled, git, ...\r\n\r\nThe features set usually offered on a document depends on a combination of these two. For example a TypeScript file stored on disk (having the schema `file`) should offer the full TypeScript feature set like diagnostics, code complete, document symbols or find all references. In contrast a TypeScript file loaded from a git index (schema `gitindex` not 100% sure about the schema name) should not provide code complete since the file is read only. Even diagnostics are questionable since users can't fix them. However document symbols are useful to navigate in large files loaded from a git index.\r\n\r\nCurrently the feature set offered doesn't take the schema into account. The editor requests all features per language mode and then disables features if the document is read-only (this is why there is no code complete on files loaded from the git index).\r\n\r\nHowever binding features to the read-only characteristic of a document can be conflicting: a prominent example are diagnostics. They are not very useful on files loaded from the git index, especially if errors are caused through inter file dependencies. However showing diagnostic for a read only file on disk does make sense since fixing the problem might be possible by changing another non read-only file.\r\n\r\n## Ideas\r\n\r\nTo handle these cases correctly VS Code could offer a capability registry for URI schemas. The extension that brings a new URI schema into the system describe the language capabilities that usually make sense on that form of URI. However it is unclear how fine grain that registry should be. One approach would be to list all language capabilities currently available in the extension API. Drawback being that when we introduce new capabilities users need to either opt in or opt out. If we use opt in then at least extension don't need to be changed if a new capability is introduce. Alternatively we can describe capability sets. Something like:\r\n\r\n- Diagnostics: it makes sense to compute diagnostics on the URI schema\r\n- Manipulating: it makes sense to provide features that manipulate the document. For example code complete, rename, ...\r\n- Structural: it makes sense to support feature that provide structural information about the document. For example document symbols\r\n- Navigational: it makes sense to support features that help navigate documents. For example: goto declarartion\r\n- Searching: it makes sense to support feature that search for symbols. For example: find all references\r\n\r\nThere is another dimension that is interesting. Language modes that are single file (like HTML) and language modes that are multi file (like TypeScript and C#) where inter file dependencies matter. Providing navigational and searching features on multi file language modes loaded from the git index for example might be confusing for users since most language server will only compute the result for that single file only. However navigating or searching for local symbols (like goto declaration of a local variable) do make sense.\r\n\r\nIf we introduce such a capability register do we need to enforce the correct behavior. We have the following possibilities:\r\n\r\n- we enforce only the read-only ness of a document (this is what we do today)\r\n- we enforce the capabilities as well. If for example an extension computes diagnostics for a URI schema that doesn't list the capability we drop the diagnostics.\r\n- we treat the capabilities has a hint and extensions / language providers need to honor them.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nI propose that we implement such a schema capability registry. Contributions to the registry can be done via code or the package.json file. The registry can be queried in the render and the extension host. A query passes in a schema or a URI and answers back the suggested capabilities. We should not enforce the honoring of the capabilities beside the read-only ness. It will unnecessarily hinder innovation. I would go with the above 5 capabilities. But reducing them to Diagnostics, Manipulating, 'Non-Manipulating' (may be someone has a better name) would address all use case I am are currently aware of.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20858","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20858/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20858/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20858/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20858","id":208639220,"number":20858,"title":"The terminal process command \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\" failed to launch (exit code: 1)","user":{"login":"joseph1125","id":8279406,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8279406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseph1125","html_url":"https://github.com/joseph1125","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseph1125/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseph1125/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseph1125/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseph1125/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseph1125/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseph1125/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseph1125/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseph1125/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseph1125/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-02-18T12:31:46Z","updated_at":"2017-02-21T19:11:26Z","closed_at":"2017-02-21T19:11:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
