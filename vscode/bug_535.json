VSCode Version: 1.9.0\r\n- OS Version: All\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nA change to editor initialization in VSCode 1.9.0 is breaking the [MSSQL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql) extension – any query execution after the 1st time you open a results pane in the WebView is failing to refresh. This means that query execution appears to fail which really is our key experience. Please note this is a breaking change in behavior from previous versions of VSCode.\r\n \r\nWe raised this a couple of days ago as #19654 which was closed with instructions to change our API call. After fixing our code we discovered the problem happens even if when calling the API correctly.\r\n- Previously, calling previewHtml would refresh the page if it already existed. This ensured our page was reloaded so the UI could show new query results. \r\n- Now, it only refreshes if it goes out of focus and comes back into focus. If it’s the main tab on ViewColumn 2, for example, it’ll never be refreshed.\r\n- This breaks our existing, released extension's behavior.\r\n\r\nSo this code snippet will open an editor with a WebView component the 1st time it runs, but subsequent calls will never refresh the page.\r\n```\r\npreviewCommandPromise = vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.previewHtml', resultsUri, resultPaneColumn, paneTitle);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe impactful change causing this only went into the main branch 6 days ago in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/translation%2F20172701.01. We believe the change is due to going from side by side to editor groups control: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commit/0763cc88587eae62eabc98f3e1363f2cee16c1f2.\r\n \r\nWhat are the next steps to finding a solution to this? I can imagine we are not the only extension that might be hit by this change. We are looking for a workaround on our side but would appreciate if we can get help on a solution or understand if this could be hotfixed by VSCode.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19731","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19731/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19731/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19731/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19731","id":204972540,"number":19731,"title":"Create

We have, as per the language protocol, 2 calls:\r\n- document/codeLens: which lists all the places in the current document that might have references. This calls returns fairly quickly\r\n- codeLens/resolve: will actually compute all references to the given codelens (the ones currently displayed on screen), it's time a consuming operation.\r\n\r\nIn the case of vscode-java, when no references are found, we return/display `0 references` as a codelens label, which is fairly annoying, as it eats some screen real estate. \r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/865769/22558569/24398e7e-e93c-11e6-8cc8-0614cf52fa43.png)\r\n\r\nEagerly resolving codelenses during the `document/codelens` call would help but it is not an option, for performance reasons.\r\n\r\nEven returning an empty label adds unnecessary pseudo-lines, moving some code off the screen.\r\n\r\nSo I was wondering: what's the best way to handle that use case? Is there a way to return special codelenses that would not generate these extra lines, or is this something that could be fixed at the vscode level, i.e, when the codelens label is empty, release that extra space?

Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.9.x\r\n- OS Version: Windows.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of `willSave` events extensions provide code which for example format on save or fix errors on save (eslint, tslint). All these will save participants do nothing if `autoSave` is set to `afterDelay` since the text manipulation could infer with typing. For example a user types `{}`, save kicks in and the linter removed the empty block because it is superfluous.\r\n\r\nTo still give users a single short cut to trigger all code cleanup actions it would be cool if we can bind these to `Ctrl+S` if `autoSave === delay`. We could do the following: if `autoSave === delay` and the file is saved, trigger `willSave`. If `willSave` changes the document (makes it dirty) save the document and trigger save event. If the document is not dirty after will save do nothing.\r\n\r\n@jrieken FYI. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19722","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19722/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19722/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19722/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19722","id":204916788,"number":19722,"title":"Is Visual Studio Code eventually going to replace Visual Studio?","user":{"login":"soljohnston777","id":17998720,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17998720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soljohnston777","html_url":"https://github.com/soljohnston777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soljohnston777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soljohnston777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soljohnston777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soljohnston777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soljohnston777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soljohnston777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soljohnston777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soljohnston777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soljohnston777/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-02-02T16:04:20Z","updated_at":"2017-02-02T16:17:04Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Is Visual Studio Code eventually going to replace Visual Studio?\r\n\r\nIt is simple to use, yet powerful.  \r\nProgrammers actually like it!\r\n\r\nI think if Microsoft should go towards this direction.
