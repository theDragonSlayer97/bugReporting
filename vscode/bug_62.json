Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: No\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Have an extension installed that registers a CodeLensProvider (e.g. gitlens)\r\n2. Open VS Code to a file (e.g. codelensController.ts) and scroll (make sure you have scrolled a non-zero amount) to a symbol in the middle of the file.\r\n4. Right click on a symbol and \"find references\".\r\n5. Adjust your window size and scroll position so the references peek view is in the middle of the screen and takes up most of the vertical height.\r\n6. Close and reopen vscode (or refresh it if running `./scripts/code.sh`) \r\n7. Immediately right click on the same symbol and find references. (i.e. before code lens has resolved).\r\n\r\nAfter the references returns, you will see the scroll position jump because CodeLensContribution tries to restore the center range:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/9a06ffca7835df3677e7219dd983382baeaa0ea7/src/vs/editor/contrib/codelens/browser/codelensController.ts#L256-L258\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the references rift view is actually in the center of the viewport, so the \"center\" line that CodeLensProvider saves to restore is actually the line after the rift view. Centering that line causes the rift view to scroll up off the screen (unexpected).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![screen recording 2017-09-07 at 11 17
