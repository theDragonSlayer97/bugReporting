The tree display different kinds of resources (say, Splines, Nines and Wines). Some commands apply to all resources (for example, Show or Delete).  Some commands apply only to Splines (say, Reticulate).  I would like to be able to say that a Spline is both a resource and a spline, and write:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"menus\": { \"view/item/context\": [\r\n        { \"command\": \"show\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == resource\" },\r\n        { \"command\": \"delete\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == resource\" },\r\n        { \"command\": \"reticulate\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == spline\" }\r\n] }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, as each item can have only one context value, that doesn't work.  I thought I might be able to kludge it using 'or' syntax but it seems like this doesn't work?  When I try this, the commands with the `||` in the conditions never show at all:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"menus\": { \"view/item/context\": [\r\n        { \"command\": \"show\", \"when\": \"view == my && (viewItem == resource || viewItem == spline)\" },\r\n        { \"command\": \"delete\", \"when\": \"view == my && (viewItem == resource || viewItem == spline)\" },\r\n        { \"command\": \"reticulate\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == spline\" }\r\n] }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the moment I've resorted to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"menus\": { \"view/item/context\": [\r\n        { \"command\": \"show\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == resource\" },\r\n        { \"command\": \"show\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == spline\" },\r\n        { \"command\": \"delete\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == resource\" },\r\n        { \"command\": \"delete\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == spline\" },\r\n        { \"command\": \"reticulate\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == spline\" }\r\n] }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is quite verbose and it seems like both this and the or-clause would be hard to maintain if another command is added that requires a new context type:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"menus\": { \"view/item/context\": [\r\n        { \"command\": \"show\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == resource\" },\r\n        { \"command\": \"show\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == spline\" },\r\n        { \"command\": \"show\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == nine\" },  // <- had to add this\r\n        { \"command\": \"delete\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == resource\" },\r\n        { \"command\": \"delete\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == spline\" },\r\n        { \"command\": \"delete\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == nine\" },  // <- and this\r\n        { \"command\": \"reticulate\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == spline\" }\r\n        { \"command\": \"squareRoot\", \"when\": \"view == my && viewItem == nine\" }  // <- so I could add this\r\n] }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a better way than this?  The scale of context menus and resource hierarchies isn't that great so it doesn't need to be a great API but at the moment it feels a bit verbose and

It should either be one or the other.\r\n\r\nThe UI button and the text suggest that it should be a single action and not a mode. The fact that the selection doesn't update (in the find UI) also suggests this. However, when pressed a second time, instead of performing the same action with a different selection, it acts as if it \"exited\" a selection mode and returns to finding every keyword in the file.

to the right terminal for me is harder than it should be. \r\n\r\nI can switch to the terminal panel easily, but from there I need to get to the right terminal. I can use shortcuts for that but they are \"unstable\" because they depend on the sequence in which I opened my terminals.\r\n\r\nI can use `Open View` but it's suboptimal because it's a long list. Good thing is terminals have ids, so I can use it to filter the list quickly.\r\n\r\nI'd like to get an Open Terminal command that opens a quick pick just for terminals.
