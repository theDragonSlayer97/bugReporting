am preparing to lead a workshop where I will be using VSCode as the suggested code editor. I've been able to bundle some useful settings, extensions and tasks directly for the class via the .vscode directory. Unfortunately, there is no way to bundle suggested keybindings for my project in the same way.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it seems relatively straightforward: the json format is already specified and keybindingResolver.ts is already wired up to take in the fixed native mappings and override them with the user-specific keybindings. This could either be extended to take two sets of overrides, or the workspace-specific ones could be concatenated to the user-specific override list.\r\n\r\nRather, I think the biggest problem is a matter of determining what .vscode/keybindings.json should do. Personally, I'd like to just use any keybindings found in that file first, then defer to user settings, then defer to native (just like the other .vscode config files), but before I consider working on a PR, I'd like to get some more opinions on what people think about this idea.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18378","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18378/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18378/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18378/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18378","id":199949022,"number":18378,"title":"Expose

have set `editor.quickSuggestions` to `false` and like to bring the suggestions up manually when I need them. Recently I encountered an issue with an extension (ChristianKohler/PathIntellisense#52) where the autocompletion popup is shown upon hitting `/`.\r\n\r\nInvestigating the API in more detail it seems that the registered *trigger characters* are used to trigger the extension in a generic fashion, independent of the extension's specific function. So while the corresponding *trigger characters* should still be registered, in the case of a `CompletionItemProvider` such a character should only trigger the extension if `editor.quickSuggestions` is set to `true`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about
