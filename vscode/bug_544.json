Open any project that's been working fine for a long time with today's new insiders build\r\n2. Observe error\r\n\r\nAs of today's new insiders build, VSCode  no longer accepts the cut the following very common settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"typescript.check.workspaceVersion\": false,\r\n  \"typescript.tsdk\": \"node_modules/typescript/lib\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs documented:\r\n\r\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript#_using-newer-typescript-versions\r\n\r\nSo this is both a bug report and a question. The question is how to achieve the following. The bug report is that there does not appear to be a way to achieve it.\r\n\r\nMany of us work on many different projects with considerable version skew of the underlying libraries and tooling. This is a per project fact, not a per developer fact. There needs to be away to specify:\r\n\r\n* Inside a project\r\n* in the source code of the project, not in some other settings that a developer must learn about and then go adjust somewhere\r\n* ideally, right here in the settings file, seems like the most reasonable place\r\n* The fact that for this project it is desirable to use the same TypeScript version for IDE support as is used in the project itself.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a new behavior in which as a user I am asked to click in the status bar to try to ask Code to use a certain version. That is a slightly nice developer experience, but it misses the point of the above.\r\n\r\nIs there a new way to specify this thing that the old settings specified? (Or better yet, is there a way to make it just be the default that always happens all the time?  Offhand it seems that using a **different** version of TypeScript for IDE support than a project uses to compile, should be the unusual case requiring a special setting and jumping through hoops.)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19451/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19450","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19450/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19450/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19450/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19450","id":203421107,"number":19450,"title":"Warning for c_cpp_properties.json","user":{"login":"neilyoung","id":731020,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/731020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilyoung","html_url":"https://github.com/neilyoung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilyoung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilyoung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilyoung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilyoung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilyoung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilyoung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilyoung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilyoung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilyoung/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":409283388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/caused-by-extension","name":"caused-by-extension","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-01-26T16:40:33Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T00:55:49Z","closed_at":"2017-01-27T00:54:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Version 1.9.0-insider (1.9.0-insider)\r\n- OS Version: Mac OSX Sierra\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
