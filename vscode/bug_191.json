is a proof-of-concept illustrating a possible fix for #29926.\r\n\r\nIt uses the `wmic process where parentProcessId=... get ...` command to query processes spawned by the shell and matches the process executables with a set of known shells (`bash.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `powershell.exe`). In the case that one of these spawned processes is a shell, its child processes are recursively examined until either there are no more child processes (nothing's running in the shell) or there are only non-shell child processes (a command is running).\r\n\r\nAfter traversing these nested shells, the path of the last reached shell is used to pick a formatter for the path (either putting it in `C:\\...`, `/mnt/c/` or `/c/` format).\r\n\r\nA gif of using different shells is below.\r\n\r\n![2017-07-03_12-34-30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18223213/27806731-14122656-5ff1-11e7-87a5-6e3b2909cce7.gif)\r\n\r\nThe way this is implemented currently has a few disadvantages though:\r\n\r\n1. For every nested shell that is traversed a new `wmic` command must be spawned. When the number of nested shells increases, it can take some time before the path is pasted. This could be solved by caching the current shell, but I wasn't sure how to go about this.\r\n\r\n2. This fails to work correctly in cases that a shell is spawned in the background (i.e. `start cmd.exe`) as there are no checks to whether the shell being traversed is in the background or foreground.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to be able to get back to this for a while soon, so feel free to play around with / heavily edit this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30070/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30069","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30069/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30069/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30069/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30069","id":240256741,"number":30069,"title":"Suggestion:

This is great for untyped or weakly typed languages like JavaScript/TypeScript. But for statically typed languages, such as C#, the best way to do this is to let the regular language service provide IntelliSense just like in the editor.\r\n\r\n### Basic proposal\r\nIn the language service registration for an extension, a language service can indicate that it supports debug console IntelliSense. If the language of the document of the current stack frame opts into this, then instead of going down the path where completion is requested from debug adapter, it is instead requested from the language service. VS Code would need to provide the location of the active stack frame in the same way that regular intellisense works. Then it would need to provide the text and position of the line being edited in the debug console.\r\n\r\nAssuming that VS Code is eventually interested in supporting this, https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1609 tracks the work in the C# extension to support this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30064","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30064/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30064/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30064/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30064","id":240225353,"number":30064,"title":"Switching
