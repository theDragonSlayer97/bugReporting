on 64-bit Windows 7 using the default integrated terminal (so cmd.exe). When I open a terminal session and then switch to Powershell by typing \"powershell,\" I get an error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFile C:\\Users\\Me\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.

execution policy setting that I have.\r\n\r\nRunning Get-ExecutionPolicy in native powershell.exe or a Powershell session opened in native cmd.exe returns \"RemoteSigned,\" but running Get-ExecutionPolicy in the integrated terminal session returns \"Restricted\" (I believe that's the default setting).\r\n\r\nPowershell does open and functions fine, but if I had my own scripts that I wanted to load and execute I believe I would run into problems.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22821","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22821/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22821/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22821/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22821","id":215170505,"number":22821,"title":"After

connected with @weinand, on my [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42640867/cannot-set-breakpoints-in-meteor-node-app-with-vs-code) posting.  Adding issue as requested.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Version 1607 (OS Build 14393.953)\r\n- Meteor: 1.4.3.2 (includes node v4.8)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce:\r\n1. **in VS Code**: configure `launch.json` attach:\r\n```\r\n  {\r\n    \"name\": \"Attach to Server\",\r\n    \"type\": \"node\",\r\n    \"request\": \"attach\",\r\n    \"port\": 5838,\r\n    \"address\": \"localhost\",\r\n    \"restart\": true,\r\n    \"timeout\": 20000,\r\n    \"sourceMaps\": true,\r\n    \"protocol\": \"legacy\",\r\n    \"outFiles\": [\"${workspaceRoot}/meris/.meteor/local/build/programs/server/**/*.js\"]\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n2. **in CMD Shell:** set `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable `set NODE_OPTIONS=--debug=5838`\r\n3. **in CMD Shell:** start meteor: `meteor`\r\n4. **in VS Code:** set a breakpoint on a source file clicking in far left column and get bright red indicator.\r\n5. **in VS Code:** attach to the process.  Successfully attaches\r\n6. **in webapp (connected to server):** execute function that will execute code where breakpoint is set.\r\n\r\n### Result:\r\nDoes not stop debugger at breakpoint set in my source file.\r\n\r\n### Other observations:\r\n- if I put a `debugger;` statement into the code\r\n1. The debugger will break on the debugger statement and I can interact with the code using the VS Code debugger;\r\n2. The debugger does not break in my source code, it brings up another tab with the source code in it.  The source code has a sub-title \"_read-only inlined content from source map_\".  And the file location is at `\\1001\\`.\r\n\r\n- if instead of attaching a VS Code debugger, I attach `node-inspector` everything works as I expect.  After attaching `node-inspector` all of my set breakpoints hit.  No `debugger;` statements required.\r\n1. After step 3 above: **in CMD shell**: `node-debug --debug-port=5838`\r\n2. Breakpoints set in `node-inspector` hit as expected.\r\n\r\n- I understand source maps in concept, but I do not understand the format of the file.  But in the sources array, the references to my source files look like this\r\n\r\n> `\"meteor://💻app/server/main.js\"`\r\n\r\nIt looks a little odd to me... what is with this 💻 character?\r\n\r\n- #7117 touches on this problem.  But more research was not performed.  Also, note that meteor now uses node v4.8 instead of  node v0.10.43\r\n\r\n### Comments\r\n- Let me know if there are some questions you need answered from the Meteor Development Team.  I will see if I can get them to engage.\r\n- Let me know if you need any other repro information.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22818/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22817","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22817/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22817/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22817/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22817","id":215160887,"number":22817,"title":"vs-code 1.11.0- insider -
