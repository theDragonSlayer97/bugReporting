For example, in C++ one can write \n\n``` c++\nint a = 10; \n{ \n    int a = 20;\n    ... // There are now two `a`'s here! \n```\n\nThe debugger can see both, even though in C++ there's no way to access the outer one.\n\nTo make this work robustly, I would suggest adding an optional \"handle\" field into `Variable`, which gets round-tripped back to the adapter in `setVariable`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10218","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10218/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10218/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10218/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10218","id":169681143,"number":10218,"title":"Add

am lacking options how to setup a debugger for my programming language.\n\nMy language has a standalone runtime the developer should be able to place anywhere. I would like the user to set a configuration variable to point out where the runtime is.\n\nHere's an example of such configuration (I will soon pump the whole code up into cheery/vscode-lever):\n\n```\n\"configuration\": {\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"title\": \"Lever tools configuration\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"lever.runtime_path\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"default\": \"c:\\\\lever\",\n      \"description\": \"The folder path to the runtime this editor should use during debugging lever applications.\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI've setup my debugger like this in package.json:\n\n```\n\"debuggers\": [\n  {\n    \"type\": \"lever\",\n    \"label\": \"Lever Debugger\",\n    \"enableBreakpointsFor\": {\n      \"languageIds\": [\n        \"lever\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"program\": \"debug.js\",\n    \"runtime\": \"node\",\n    \"args\": [],\n    \"variables\": {\n      \"getLeverRuntimePath\": \"extension.getLeverRuntimePath\"\n    },\n    \"initialConfigurations\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Lever-Run\",\n        \"type\": \"lever\",\n        \"request\": \"launch\",\n        \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/main.lc\",\n        \"lever_path\": \"${command.getLeverRuntimePath}\",\n        \"stopOnEntry\": false\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Lever-Debug\",\n        \"type\": \"lever\",\n        \"request\": \"launch\",\n        \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/main.lc\",\n        \"lever_path\": \"${command.getLeverRuntimePath}\",\n        \"stopOnEntry\": true\n      }\n    ],\n    \"configurationAttributes\": {\n      \"program\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"Workspace relative path to script to run\",\n        \"default\": \"${workspaceRoot}/main.lc\"\n      },\n      \"stopOnEntry\": {\n        \"type\": \"boolean\",\n        \"description\": \"Automatically stop after launch.\",\n        \"default\": true\n      },\n      \"lever_path\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"Path to lever's configuration file\",\n        \"default\": \"${command.getLeverRuntimePath}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n],\n```\n\nThe problems in this kind of configuration is that the user has to define \"lever_path\" -variable in their launch.json. I also get the runtime path only after the debugger has officially gone up. This means that I am unable to program my native runtime to fetch debug routine from lib/debugger.lc\n\nTherefore I am forced to implement the debugging API via a node script. This problem prevents me from implementing debugging interfaces of the vscode within my language, and will prevent the spread of this debugging API.\n\nI would prefer to get my config variable lever.runtime_path in environment variable, I tried to set it in extension.js with process.env.LEVER_PATH = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(\"lever\").get(\"runtime_path\") without success.\n\n(I am also unable to obtain a directory open dialog, so that I could assist the user to fill the configuration option when starting my tool, but I am not sure if that's a feature)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10208","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10208/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10208/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10208/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10208","id":169644183,"number":10208,"title":"Open

I have tested this by building and installing code-oss on my system and trying various scenarios:\n- `code-oss` from a command prompt opens a new GUI window and does not block the command window it was launched from.\n- `code-oss --wait` and `code-oss --verbose` block the command prompt while still opening the GUI window.\n- Running `code-oss` from Windows 10 search (I had to enter the full path) launches the VS code GUI and only briefly flashes the console window.\n- Running `code-oss --verbose` from Windows 10 search (I had to enter the full path) launches the VS code GUI and leaves a console open in the background with information written to it.\n- I am not yet sure if `code-oss file.txt` works as my build is not complete but given that `CALL` would be used in that case I expect it to be fine.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10200","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10200/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10200/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10200/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10200","id":169620327,"number":10200,"title":"Twitching after saving html file","user":{"login":"today-","id":745745,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/745745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/today-","html_url":"https://github.com/today-","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/today-/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/today-/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/today-/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/today-/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/today-/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/today-/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/today-/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/today-/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/today-/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":409283388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/caused-by-extension","name":"caused-by-extension","color":"E2A1C2","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-08-05T14:30:38Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T15:02:14Z","closed_at":"2016-08-11T15:02:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.5.0-insider (1a7ca5a77bf6b63951e499ea93b7316d36118ade, 2016-08-05T07:19:53.669Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 6.1.7601\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
