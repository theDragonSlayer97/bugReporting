VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.17.0-insider (f7962f0682a76516df51de4856f8ccc5d8ad578a, 2017-09-20T05:24:33.599Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT x64 6.1.7601\r\n- Extensions: none\r\n---\r\n\r\nKey bindings for commands that toggle sidebar or panel visibility ignore 'when' clause contexts, making it impossible to limit them to certain contexts.\r\n\r\n**Use case:** some shortcut schemes (e.g. Intellij IDEA) have a shortcut to hide current active sidebar or panel, and [a VScode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=k--kato.intellij-idea-keybindings) that provides such keybindings wants to recreate this functionality [through a shortcut that toggles panels and the sidebar only when they are active](\r\nhttps://github.com/k--kato/vscode-intellij-idea-keybindings/blob/196930a21d640292fba481200489234a272220e1/package.json#L771-L807), essentially turning a toggle into a closer. But since 'when' clause contexts for these actions always evaluate to true, the shortcuts become globally active and act as toggles. And while the last three shortcuts from that snippet are replaceable with a global shortcut for `workbench.action.closePanel`, there is no corresponding action to close (not toggle) the sidebar.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Pick an unused shortcut, e.g. `ctrl+l`, and a context that would be inactive during the next steps, e.g. `parameterHintsVisible`.\r\n2. Add any one of the following settings to `keybindings.json`:\r\n```json\r\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+l\",                \"command\": \"workbench.action.toggleSidebarVisibility\",\r\n                                     \"when\": \"parameterHintsVisible\" }\r\n```\r\n```json\r\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+l\",                \"command\": \"workbench.action.togglePanel\",\r\n                                     \"when\": \"parameterHintsVisible\" }\r\n```\r\n```json\r\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+l\",                \"command\": \"workbench.actions.view.problems\",\r\n                                     \"when\": \"parameterHintsVisible\" }\r\n```\r\n```json\r\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+l\",                \"command\": \"workbench.debug.action.toggleRepl\",\r\n                                     \"when\": \"parameterHintsVisible\" }\r\n```\r\n```json\r\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+l\",                \"command\": \"workbench.action.terminal.toggleTerminal\",\r\n                                     \"when\": \"parameterHintsVisible\" }\r\n```\r\n3. Set focus to the current text editor.\r\n4. Press `ctrl+l`.\r\n\r\n**Expected result:** nothing should happen, the 'when' clause evaluates to false so the shortcut should be disabled.\r\n**Actual result:** the shortcut works, the relevant panel/sidebar visibility is toggled.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35224","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35224/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35224/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35224/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/35224","id":260935528,"number":35224,"title":"Update tweet message limit.
