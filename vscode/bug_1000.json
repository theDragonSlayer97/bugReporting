Reference counts go away. Autocomplete stops working. Jumping to declarations don't do anything, then it will jump to the declaration about 5 minutes after I clicked the action. Just hitting enter to start typing on a new line messes everything up.\n\nHow can I speed up load times for this? Did I set something up wrong?\n\nMono should be up to date. I updated dnvm stuff suggested by some stackoverflow post. When I do 'dnvm list' on terminal, I get this:\n\n```\nActive Version              Runtime Architecture OperatingSystem Alias\n------ -------              ------- ------------ --------------- -----\n       1.0.0-rc1-update2    coreclr x64          darwin          \n  *    1.0.0-rc1-update2    mono                 linux/osx       default\n```\n\nI don't get any actual errors. I will get a message when ever I make a change saying, \"Some projects had trouble loading. Please review the output for more details.\" The omnisharp log for this is:\n\n```\n[INFO] Starting OmniSharp at 'PROJECTPATH/client-csharp.sln'...\n[INFO] Started OmniSharp from '/Users/KingKlong/.vscode/extensions/ms-vscode.csharp-0.3.7/bin/omnisharp' with process id 91421...\n[INFORMATION:OmniSharp.Startup] Omnisharp server running using stdio at location 'PROJECTPATH' on host 90813.\n[INFORMATION:OmniSharp.Dnx.DnxPaths] Using runtime '/Users/KingKlong/.dnx/runtimes/dnx-mono.1.0.0-rc1-update2'.\n[INFORMATION:OmniSharp.Dnx.DnxProjectSystem] Scanning 'PROJECTPATH' for DNX projects\n[INFORMATION:OmniSharp.Dnx.DnxProjectSystem] No project.json based projects found\n[INFORMATION:OmniSharp.MSBuild.MSBuildProjectSystem] Detecting projects in 'PROJECTPATH/client-csharp.sln'.\n[INFORMATION:OmniSharp.MSBuild.MSBuildProjectSystem] Loading project from 'PROJECTPATH/Assembly-CSharp-firstpass-vs.csproj'.\n[INFORMATION:OmniSharp.MSBuild.MSBuildProjectSystem] Loading project from 'PROJECTPATH/Assembly-CSharp-vs.csproj'.\n[INFORMATION:OmniSharp.MSBuild.MSBuildProjectSystem] Loading project from 'PROJECTPATH/Assembly-CSharp-Editor-firstpass-vs.csproj'.\n[INFORMATION:OmniSharp.MSBuild.MSBuildProjectSystem] Loading project from 'PROJECTPATH/Assembly-CSharp-Editor-vs.csproj'.\n[INFORMATION:OmniSharp.ScriptCs.ScriptCsProjectSystem] Detecting CSX files in 'PROJECTPATH'.\n[INFORMATION:OmniSharp.ScriptCs.ScriptCsProjectSystem] Could not find any CSX files\n[INFORMATION:OmniSharp.Startup] Solution has finished loading\n```\n\nAlso, the flame icon on the bottom right corner says \"0 projects\". When I click on it, it lists two .sln files. One is client.sln . The other is client-csharp.sln. When I click either of them, they seem to work the same. The flame icon will still say \"0 projects\" after I click either of them. The guide says to click the -csharp one, but other stackoverflow posts say to choose the other. Which one should I be clicking? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5775","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5775/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5775/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5775/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5775","id":150946672,"number":5775,"title":"Highlight HTML/CSS/JS in different language","user":{"login":"imperez","id":481144,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/481144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imperez","html_url":"https://github.com/imperez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imperez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imperez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imperez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imperez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imperez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imperez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imperez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imperez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imperez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-25T18:35:51Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T11:04:46Z","closed_at":"2016-04-27T11:04:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm not sure if this is already possible but the documentation seems scarce about how to do this.

PowerShell, it's fairly common for the user to press Enter in response to a prompt on the screen.  For example, there could be a prompt for the user's choice which allows a default value to be accepted by pressing Enter.  There's also the scenario where the user might be asked for a string of input where an empty string may be valid or indicate the use of a default.\n\nCould the debug console allow empty inputs to be sent to the debug adapter?  Sending it across as a null or empty string would be fine.\n\nThanks!\n\n---\n- VSCode Version: 1.0.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Install the PowerShell extension\n2. Open workspace path `c:\\Users\\<yourusername>\\.vscode\\extensions\\ms-vscode.PowerShell-0.5.0\\examples`\n3. Select file `DebugTest.ps1` and press F5\n4. Pause the debugger while executing\n5. In the Debug Console, execute the following line `Read-Host -Prompt \"Enter a string\"`\n6. When the prompt is displayed, try to press Enter or press the spacebar and then press Enter.\n7. Observe that the prompt does not proceed.  Only after typing a non-empty string can the prompt be
