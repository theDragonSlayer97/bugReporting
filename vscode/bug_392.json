not even sure I have correctly titled this... But for whatever is worth here's the steps...\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a file, typescript in my case (reproduced with C# file as well), let's say `test.ts`.\r\n2. Rename it changing just the character case, like `test.ts` -> `Test.ts` (or change casing for all letters, doesn't matter as long as only character casing is changed) using rename from folder view.\r\n3. Rename a symbol using right-click, or just reference a module and import it using `Ctrl + .`, just so the file is edited not manually but by an editor action.\r\n4. The previously named file will open in the editor with the change that was made, so `test.ts` will open and include the change made and `Test.ts` will still show contents without changes.\r\n5. Save the `test.ts` file, close it, now`Test.ts` shows the correct contents.\r\n6. Repeat steps with any change that is done by the editor (like rename symbol) and this goes on indefinitely, a file with the previous name is opened. So a new rename to `TEST.ts` followed by an editor action like rename symbol, will open `Test.ts`.\r\n7. Do any manual change in the file and just save it, the file is saved without opening the file with the previous name and shows correct content as expected.\r\n\r\nThis happens with git tracked files as well as entirely new files not yet tracked by git. Moreover, it happens with and rename that is only a character case change, doesn't matter how many character casings are done, so `Test`, `TEST` etc. should behave the same.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24038/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24037","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24037/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24037/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24037/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24037","id":219860731,"number":24037,"title":"cannot create new git branch after upgrade to 1.11.0","user":{"login":"shootermv","id":1336862,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1336862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shootermv","html_url":"https://github.com/shootermv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shootermv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shootermv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shootermv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shootermv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shootermv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shootermv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shootermv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shootermv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shootermv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-04-06T10:58:49Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T16:56:13Z","closed_at":"2017-04-06T16:56:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
