VSCode Version: 1.2.0\n- OS Version: Windows 7 64-bit with Polish language pack\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Install [Clink](https://mridgers.github.io/clink/).\n2. Toggle integrated terminal in VSCode.\n3. With \"clink set option_name value\" command, change esc_clears_line to 1 and use_altgr_substitute to 0.\n4. Try to use Clink shortcut that require combination of alt + ctrl + _anything_, where _anything_ is a key, that combined with altgr will make a special character on your system. Instead of Clink function, in VSCode integrated terminal you'll see that special character. For me, that's for example _ć_ character, instead of _copy whole line_ function.\n5. Try to use alt + h shortcut to show help of Clink. Instead, help menu of VSCode will expand.\n6. Try to clear a line with the escape key. Line will be cleared, but terminal will hide.\n\nClink is very good expansion for Windows' standard cmd, while integrated terminal is very good expansion for VSCode - so I'm really disappointed they aren't fully compatible with each other.
