The Issue\r\n\r\nI'm writing an AppleScript for opening a terminal and writing some stuff in it, the problem is that without an hard coded delay between the action \"open the terminal\" and the action \"write this stuff in it\" it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThis is what, ideally, should be working (minus the useless delay call):\r\n\r\n```applescript\r\ntell application \"Visual Studio Code\" to activate\r\ntell application \"System Events\"\r\n\tkeystroke \"`\" using control down\r\n\tdelay 0\r\n\tkeystroke \"placeholder\"\r\nend tell\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what I see in the terminal if I run the AppleScript with different delay values: \r\n- 0: `fabiomac:project fabio$` ❌\r\n- 0.1: `fabiomac:project fabio$` ❌\r\n- 0.15 `placeholderfabiomac:project fabio$ placeholder` ❌ 😮 \r\n- 0.2

Notice that the window doesn't adjust scrolling to keep cursors visible.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior is that they would stay visible (if not all of them can, then at least the \"main\" or start cursor).

Make sure vscode handles this case gracefully\r\n* Be creative in trying to break the explorer","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29176/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29175","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29175/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29175/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29175/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29175","id":237458284,"number":29175,"title":"Inaccurate information in Tasks documentation","user":{"login":"DavidA2014","id":7724321,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7724321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidA2014","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidA2014","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidA2014/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidA2014/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidA2014/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidA2014/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidA2014/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidA2014/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidA2014/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidA2014/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidA2014/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"gregvanl","id":12818376,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12818376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl","html_url":"https://github.com/gregvanl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-21T08:45:13Z","updated_at":"2017-06-23T13:46:51Z","closed_at":"2017-06-23T13:46:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In the tasks documentation page:\r\n\r\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks\r\n\r\nThe page states:\r\n\r\n\"Select the Tasks: Configure Task Runner command and you will see a list of task runner templates.

I'd prefer to turn the Peek off in this case as its quite annoying.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for a wonderful IDE btw.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29172","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29172/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29172/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29172/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29172","id":237451345,"number":29172,"title":"Test: tree and list aria-posinset and aria-setsize","user":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":316813364,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/accessibility","name":"accessibility","color":"d93f0b","default":false},{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/44","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/44","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/44/labels","id":2523274,"number":44,"title":"June 2017","description":"","creator":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":551,"state":"closed","created_at":"2017-05-16T07:04:24Z","updated_at":"2017-07-26T15:18:43Z","due_on":"2017-06-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-07-12T04:06:38Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-21T08:19:09Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T07:16:47Z","closed_at":"2017-06-27T21:28:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- [x] win - @ramya-rao-a \r\n- [x] mac - @roblourens\r\n\r\nComplexity: 2\r\n\r\nRefs: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27900\r\n\r\nWe have added the `aria-posinset` and `aria-setsize` attributes to the list and quick open.
