Press F1 key and input related command is working, but this is not obvious enough because command input only placeholder text instead of command text.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27015","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27015/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27015/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27015/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27015","id":230199924,"number":27015,"title":"Auto Complete pops up \"invalid arguments\" message","user":{"login":"Eli-Goldberg","id":19211868,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/19211868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eli-Goldberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Eli-Goldberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eli-Goldberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eli-Goldberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eli-Goldberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eli-Goldberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eli-Goldberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eli-Goldberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eli-Goldberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eli-Goldberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eli-Goldberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":421907356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/suggest","name":"suggest","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":291057332,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/verified","name":"verified","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-05-21T06:12:21Z","updated_at":"2017-06-01T09:22:16Z","closed_at":"2017-05-22T07:42:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"An annoying warning message pops when using auto-complete (see image below)\r\nI've disabled all extensions.\r\n\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- VSCode Version: \r\nVersion 1.13.0-insider\r\nCommit cdaa5f28efd6d6fa012a34a92a6cf3fe57928b38\r\nDate 2017-05-19T05:11:19.365Z\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

Since VSCode spends quite a large portion of time running JS code, there will a performance win to use x64 JIT compiler.\r\n- In order to improve stability, performance, and security, Chrome automatically migrates to 64-bits Chrome for 64-bits OS users with more than 4GB RAM but use 32-bits Chrome. VSCode is unlikely to be attacked, but who can refuse more security and stability?

This can be configured in `node-gyp` to build 64-bits binaries.\r\n\r\nWhat is the main concern not doing

noticed a regression in the Haxe extension's metadata completion (https://github.com/vshaxe/vshaxe/issues/121). The issue first appeared in the March release (1.11.0), more specifically https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commit/264908a434e98f9b22f8de358b3636200c332ea4 (isolated using `git bisect`). It can be reproduced with this code:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n'use strict';\r\nimport * as vscode from 'vscode';\r\n\r\nexport function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {\r\n    vscode.languages.registerCompletionItemProvider('foo', {\r\n        provideCompletionItems(doc, pos) {\r\n            return [new vscode.CompletionItem(':foo'), new vscode.CompletionItem(':Foo')];\r\n        }\r\n    }, \"@\", \":\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSomehow `:foo` is missing here, while `:Foo` still matches.\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/5iXbjfS.png)\r\n\r\nCompare this with the behavior in the February release:\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/h4dJIci.png)\r\n\r\nNote: I realize that this is fixed by removing the `:` trigger character, but this is necessary in the Haxe extension to provide completion for type hints.
