to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a JavaScript File with this content (the variable c99 is used to wrap the Game class in its own namespace, a common pattern in JavaScript):\r\n```\r\nvar c99 = {};\r\n\r\nc99.Game = (function () {\r\n    function Count99Game() {\r\n        console.log('Count99 game starts.');\r\n        this.initGame();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Count99Game.prototype.initGame = function () {\r\n        this.nextCountLabel = document.getElementById('next-count');\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return Count99Game;\r\n})();\r\n```\r\n2. Right-click on the \"initGame\" function on line 6 and choose \"Go to Definition\". Nothing happens. Expected behavior: The cursor should be positioned on line 9 where the function is defined. Works in NetBeans, for example.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27044","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27044/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27044/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27044/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27044","id":230258422,"number":27044,"title":"Escape for `keepEditor` and `hideInterfaceOverview`","user":{"login":"JerryGreen","id":13215662,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13215662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryGreen","html_url":"https://github.com/JerryGreen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryGreen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryGreen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryGreen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryGreen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryGreen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryGreen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryGreen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryGreen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JerryGreen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":421131022,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/as-designed","name":"as-designed","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2017-05-22T00:00:44Z","updated_at":"2017-05-24T07:02:24Z","closed_at":"2017-05-24T07:02:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I want to keep my tab active (not closing when switch to another file, `keepEditor` command) with escape and I want to hide hints (`hideInterfaceOverview`) with the same button.

Can this be configured to work properly instead of all these move up/down lines that are now used by alt+up/down shortcut?\r\n\r\nThe only thing that seems the be working the same in vscode is alt+shift+mouse click or moving mouse while holding left button down.\r\n\r\nColumn mode edit/selection isn't some kind of random set of shortcuts, but has clear logic (in VS or Notepad++ or any other editor that does the same), in short the logic is simple: just like regular selection works with mouse or cursor navigation column mode works **exactly the same** the only difference is that alt is needed to change line-mode to column-mode. Or to put it in other words: holding shift enables selection mode, selection mode is switched to column-mode if alt is pressed also.\r\n\r\nThere was never Ctrl involved, why would you do that kind of mess?!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27032","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27032/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27032/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27032/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27032","id":230229671,"number":27032,"title":"Ctrl+s saves/overwrites the wrong content to the wrong file -
