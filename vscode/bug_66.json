#33739 \r\n\r\nThe SCM viewlet is always using `window.showTextDocument` when clicking on a file in the list of outgoing changes, however this will fail with an error if the file is binary.

However, that was changed via https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commit/c0381f2b62b9bf1b3d81f9f88b82a9eb5bd873dc to support more options when opening actual text files.\r\n\r\nThis fix adds `TextDocumentShowOptions` to the `vscode.open` command so that binary files can also be opened. \r\n\r\nI realize we had this request going on already via https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/30675 but at that time I did not see the issue with binary files.

@DatGuyJonathan on August 31, 2017 22:0_\n\nI'm working on a debugger extension that supports multiple stopped threads. When the user clicks 'continue', the debug adapter (DA) handles continueRequest with the backend and responds to VS Code with allThreadsContinued = false. The backend will eventually notify DA that the thread has finished, so DA sends a ThreadEvent with reason 'exited' to VS Code.\r\n\r\nIf I have multiple stopped threads and perform 'continue' on one of them, VS Code removes all the threads from the call stack view. My workaround is to send a stopped event to VS Code for every thread that the DA knows about, but that seems expensive because the DA will have to handle stackTraceRequest for threads that haven't changed.\r\n\r\nIs that workaround the expected behavior from DA?\r\n\r\nHere are the versions I'm working with:\r\nVS Code: 1.15.0\r\nvscode-debugadapter & vscode-debugprotocol:

reffed issue, automatically indents next line after an html tag is opened\r\n\r\nThe changes allow a language to supply a `partialEndOfIncreaseIndentPattern` RegExp.\r\nWhen supplied, vscode will use this pattern to determine whether or not to test `increaseIndentPattern` against more lines.\r\n\r\nFor example if we have\r\n```\r\n<div data-foor=\"foo\"\r\n        data-bar=\"bar\">\r\n```\r\nHitting return when the cursor is ahead of the `>` will now correctly indent the new line (it did not previously)\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the commit, this is also fixes the reffed issue, when now a `</div>` will be correctly indented\r\n \r\nOne unfortunate issue I see is that github makes my changes look much more dramatic than they actually are.\r\nTo display the changes as intended use visual studio code and you'll get a cleaner diff\r\n\r\nOne basic change I made to the function I had to add my changes to is change something like this.\r\n```\r\nif(condition){\r\n      return val;\r\n} else if (condition2){\r\n      return val2;\r\n} else {\r\n      return val3\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```\r\nif(condition){\r\n      return val;\r\n} \r\n\r\nif (condition2){\r\n      return val2;\r\n} \r\n\r\nreturn val3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason I did this is because one of the conditions required a little more logic than what can be squeezed in into an expression within the parentheses of an if, and I noticed that a lot of the logic for the last else was squeezed into the function rather than being factored out in a separate method (which is what I could have also done while maintaining the previous condition structure)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any changes are required\r\n\r\nCheers","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4486","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"D01D:366E:7260A0:F0E67B:59D9322E","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=67>;
