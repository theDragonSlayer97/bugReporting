VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: Lubuntu 16.04 (Linux 4.8.0-41-generic)\r\n\r\n### The Problem:\r\nThe JavaScript Language Service doesn't recognize interfaces defined in **.ts** and **.d.ts** files.\r\nAs a result, interfaces doesn't show up in the _\"quick suggestions\"_ list.\r\nMoreover, interfaces and **even classes** defined in those files cannot be used to declare types using JSDoc comments.\r\nThis prevents the programmer from taking advantage of the contract defined in the `interface` or `class` to write type-checked and bug-free code.\r\n\r\n### The Proposal:\r\nJavaScript IntelliSense is provided through the TypeScript Language Service.\r\nAs of now, the TypeScript Language Service has been used already to provide the same functionality described above in other products. <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/JavaScript-Language-Service-in-Visual-Studio#-intellisense-based-on-typescript-declaration-files\">See Here</a>\r\n\r\nHere is the relevant part of the article:\r\n> Because JavaScript and TypeScript are now based on the same language service, they are able to interact in a richer way. For example, JavaScript IntelliSense can be provided for values declared in a .d.ts file, and types such as interfaces and classes declared in TypeScript are available for use as types in JsDoc comments.\r\n> \r\n> Below, we show a simple example of a TypeScript definition file providing such type information (via an interface) to a JavaScript file in the same project (using a JsDoc tag).\r\n\r\nIt seems possible that we can extend the functionality of the TypeScript Language Service to provide such a cool and needed feature like this.\r\n\r\nI would love to work on this. Sadly, I don't have experience with the VSCode project.\r\nNevertheless, Everyone in the VSCode community who can help or provide technical insights is very much welcome.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23169","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23169/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23169/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23169/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23169","id":216852363,"number":23169,"title":"Wrap

They also research, sometimes up to 30% (or more) of their time. Hunting  for answers at stackoverflow, reading web based documentation, checking stuff at github etc.\r\n- This is done using the browser of our choice, quickly polluting our desktop workspace with dozens of tabs in multiple browser windows. And yes - unlike editors - browsers didn't change since the invention of tabs almost a decade ago!\r\n- Digging deeper, we will quickly realize that we act as \"multiple identities\" for different projects, resulting in multiple research-sessions: As developer, as employee, as private person. We spin up the browser every time a new request comes in: Buy that new SDD, research about standard.js, book that travel your girlfriend is desperately waiting for - all while having Typescript-, Babel-, C#- documentation open at the same time.\r\n\r\n## The reality: All this happens while coding.\r\n\r\nYes. Coding is writing, but what we do most of the time is reading! And as of today, there is no smart tool for that!\r\n\r\n## The suggestion, short version\r\n- Add another Icon (Browser) to the activity bar, so we can open some sort of a tab-/browser history presented as (large) thumbnails in the sidebar comparable to the list of extensions. These previews should be as large as - for example - Safari's Tab preview. \r\n- This visual history list could show open browser tabs on top (almost like the open editors list) and all others as history tabs below.\r\n- We could also organize our tabs / history of web pages in folder structures like code, however: It might be better to be able to just search our browsing history (which is mostly documentation anyway) from command palette.\r\n- To open one of these pages / tabs / history-URLs we could simply drag them to one of the editor groups, allowing us to split browser windows like we split editors. This way we can view a sample or tutorial on the left and code at the same time on the right. (No more cmd-tab)\r\n- Even better: We could open our running code on the left and our currently running web app on the right! This is more desirable on the mac than on windows, since auto arranging windows isn't so intuitive on the Mac ...\r\n\r\nImplementing all this shouldn't be too hard since the editors are HTML, and all the action bar / sidebar / drag&drop / split features are implemented anyway.\r\n\r\nBut: Doing this well is important. This is why current extensions don't do the job well enough. Visual Studio also has some browsing, but people usually don't use it because it lacks the tab management-, history-, search- and organization features .\r\n\r\n\r\n## On the long run:\r\n\r\nGetting this kind of advanced research-based browsing functionality could even be useful as a separate product. Not just for docs.microsoft.com but for everyone who suffers the \"Too many tabs\" problem.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23164","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23164/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23164/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23164/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23164","id":216809997,"number":23164,"title":"Extensions proxy support","user":{"login":"GitjoPowershell","id":26654351,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26654351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitjoPowershell","html_url":"https://github.com/GitjoPowershell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitjoPowershell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitjoPowershell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitjoPowershell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitjoPowershell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitjoPowershell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitjoPowershell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitjoPowershell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitjoPowershell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitjoPowershell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":403743745,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/proxy","name":"proxy","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-03-24T14:54:43Z","updated_at":"2017-07-03T12:36:47Z","closed_at":"2017-07-03T12:36:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Dear Team, Many thanks for this product used as a replacement of ISE on my every day work.\r\nI work behind a corporate proxy that I manage to set up in vs code, it's working for Vs code update. \r\nHowever I get 407 Authentication required when I try to install or check extension.

Thus far I've got it to the point where one launch task can ssh into the vagrant image, run `gulp` to build and then `node` to execute the task. But the later part _has_ to be done with the integrated terminal, rather than the integrated console. If I let it use the console, it simply shows the command to be executed in the _Debug Console_ view (in yellow) and nothing else. The node process isn't run on the VM.\r\n\r\nI have a second launch task that can then be used to attach the debugger to the running instance. Ideally that would be possible with a single launch task, but I can't figure that out (although that isn't the main element of this issue).\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

I will list more translation issues in a separate issue, or wait for the community translation portal (mentioned in #15077) to become alive later.\r\n\r\n# Translation issues\r\n\r\n## i18n/chs/src/vs/base/browser/ui/resourceViewer/resourceViewer.i18n.json\r\n\r\n### nativeBinaryError\r\n\r\n- Current: `文件将不在编辑器中显示，因为它是二进制文件、非常大或使用不支持的文本编码。`\r\n- Issue(s): Syntax issue: Words' order is not correct & Wrong structure\r\n- Suggested Fix: `因为此文件是二进制文件，或文件过大，或使用了不受支持的文本编码，将不会在编辑器中显示。`\r\n\r\n## i18n/chs/src/vs/base/common/errors.i18n.json\r\n\r\n### notImplementedError\r\n\r\n- Current: `未实施`\r\n- Issue(s): Translation is not consistent with other Microsoft products and common Chinese usage\r\n- Suggested Fix: `未实现`\r\n\r\n## i18n/chs/src/vs/base/common/processes.i18n.json\r\n\r\n### ExecutableParser.args\r\n\r\n- Current: `警告: args 的类型必须为 string[]。正在忽略值 {0}。`\r\n- Issue(s)： It should be future progressive tense(将忽略值), not present tense(正在忽略值). \r\n- Suggested Fix: `警告: args 的类型必须为 string[]。将忽略值 {0}。`\r\n\r\n### ExecutableParser.invalidCWD\r\n\r\n- Current: `警告: options.cwd 的类型必须为字符串。正在忽略值 {0}。`\r\n- Issue(s): See `ExecutableParser.args`\r\n- Suggested Fix: `警告: options.cwd 的类型必须为字符串。将忽略值 {0}。`\r\n\r\n### ExecutableParser.isShellCommand\r\n\r\n- Current: `警告: isShellCommand 的类型必须为布尔型。正在忽略值 {0}。`\r\n- Issue(s): See `ExecutableParser.args`\r\n- Suggested Fix: `警告: isShellCommand 的类型必须为布尔型。将忽略值 {0}。`\r\n\r\n## i18n/chs/src/vs/code/electron-main/menus.i18n.json\r\n\r\n### miIntroductoryVideos\r\n\r\n- Current: `介绍性视频(&&V)`\r\n- Issue(s): It is not necessary to stress \"Introductory\" as an adjective (介绍性) in Chinese.\r\n- Suggested Fix: `介绍视频(&&V)`\r\n\r\n### miKeyboardShortcuts\r\n\r\n- Current: `键盘快捷方式引用(&&K)`\r\n- Issue(s): The word \"reference\" can be translated into different words, depending on the context. \"引用\" means \"mentioning something (e.g. .NET Assembly)\". In this case, \"reference\" means \"looking for information\" (how to use keyboard shortcuts), which should be translated to \"参考\".\r\n- Suggested Fix: `键盘快捷方式参考(&&K)`\r\n\r\n## i18n/chs/src/vs/code/electron-main/windows.i18n.json\r\n\r\n### appStalledDetail\r\n\r\n- Current: `可以重新打开或关闭窗，或者保持等待。`\r\n- Issue(s): Not consistent with other translation of \"window\" (窗口). Translation of \"you\" is missing.\r\n- Suggested Fix: `你可以重新打开或关闭窗口，或者保持等待。`\r\n\r\n## i18n/chs/src/vs/workbench/browser/actions/configureLocale.i18n.json\r\n\r\n### restart\r\n\r\n- Current: `要更改值需要重启 VSCode。`\r\n- Issue(s): Syntax issue\r\n- Suggested Fix: `若要更改值，VSCode 需要重启。`\r\n\r\n## i18n/chs/src/vs/workbench/electron-browser/actions.i18n.json\r\n\r\n### openIntroductoryVideosUrl\r\n\r\n- Current: `介绍性视频`\r\n- Issue(s): See `miIntroductoryVideos`.\r\n- Suggested Fix: `介绍视频`\r\n\r\n## i18n/chs/src/vs/workbench/electron-browser/crashReporter.i18n.json\r\n\r\n### telemetry.enableCrashReporting\r\n\r\n- Current: `启用要发送给 Microsoft 的故障报表。\\n此选项需重启才可生效。`\r\n- Issue(s): Syntax issue: sentence structure is not clear. Word \"报表\" is financial-related in Chinese. And the translation is not consistent with other Microsoft products.\r\n- Suggested Fix: `允许将错误报告发送给 Microsoft。\\n此选项需重启才可生效。`\r\n\r\n## i18n/chs/src/vs/workbench/electron-browser/extensionHost.i18n.json\r\n\r\n### extensionHostProcess.startupFail\r\n\r\n- Current: `扩展主机未在 10 秒内启动，这可能是一个问题。`\r\n- Issue(s): Of course this is a problem - extension host doesn't start in 10 seconds. The translation should stress that \"something might happened\".\r\n- Suggested Fix: `扩展主机未在 10 秒内启动，可能发生了一个问题。`\r\n\r\n## i18n/chs/src/vs/workbench/electron-browser/shell.i18n.json\r\n\r\n### runningAsRoot\r\n\r\n- Current: `不建议将 Code 作为“根”运行。`\r\n- Issue(s): It is not necessary to translate \"root\" user to \"根\".\r\n- Suggested Fix: `不建议以 “root” 用户身份运行 Code。`\r\n\r\n## i18n/chs/src/vs/workbench/electron-main/windows.i18n.json\r\n\r\n### appStalledDetail\r\n\r\n- Current: `可以重新打开或关闭窗，或者保持等待。`\r\n- Issue(s): See another `appStalledDetail`.\r\n- Suggested Fix: `你可以重新打开或关闭窗口，或者保持等待。`\r\n\r\n## i18n/chs/src/vs/workbench/parts/welcome/page/electron-browser/vs_code_welcome_page.i18n.json\r\n\r\n### welcomePage.stackOverflow\r\n\r\n- Current: `堆栈溢出`\r\n- Issue(s): It refers StackOverFlow.com. According to Microsoft localization guideline, first-level product name should not be translated unless it has a localized name. Stack Overflow doesn't have one.\r\n- Suggested Fix: `Stack OverFlow`\r\n\r\n### welcomePage.introductoryVideos\r\n\r\n- Current: `介绍性视频`\r\n- Issue(s): See `miIntroductoryVideos`.\r\n- Suggested Fix: `介绍视频`\r\n\r\n### welcomePage.interfaceOverview\r\n\r\n- Current: `接口概述`\r\n- Issue(s): The word **interface**'s meaning differs according to context. For here, it should be \"user interface\"(用户界面), not the \"interface\"(接口) in programming language.\r\n- Suggested Fix: `用户界面概述`\r\n\r\n### welcomePage.interfaceOverviewDescription\r\n\r\n- Current: `获取突出显示 UI 主要组件的视觉覆盖`\r\n- Issue(s): Syntax error and incomplete translation.\r\n- Suggested Fix: `使用视觉覆盖层突出显示用户界面的主要组件`\r\n\r\n### welcomePage.interactivePlaygroundDescription\r\n\r\n- Current: `请在简短演练中试用编辑器的基本功能`\r\n- Issue(s): It is not necessary to use imperative mood here.\r\n- Suggested Fix: `在简短演练中试用编辑器的基本功能`\r\n\r\n## i18n/chs/src/vs/workbench/parts/tasks/common/taskConfiguration.i18n.json\r\n\r\n- Current: `警告: options.cwd 必须属于字符串类型。正在忽略值 {0}\\n`\r\n- Issue(s): See `ExecutableParser.invalidCWD`\r\n- Suggested Fix: `警告: options.cwd 必须属于字符串类型。将忽略 {0} 值\\n`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23144","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23144/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23144/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23144/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23144","id":216706065,"number":23144,"title":"Should

Create python script:\r\n```python\r\n#!/bin/env python3\r\n\r\nline = \"\"\" \"{ \\\"package\\\": {\\\"type\\\": \\\"tcp\\\", \\\"total_length\\\" :0, \\\"header_length\\\": 0, \\\"body_length\\\": 0, \\\"TCP\\\": {\\\"source_port\\\": -1, \\\"dest_port\\\": -1, \\\"seq_num\\\": -1, \\\"ack_num\\\": -1, \\\"flag_urgent\\\": false, \\\"flag_ack\\\": false, \\\"flag_push\\\": false, \\\"flag_reset\\\": false, \\\"flag_sync\\\": false, \\\"flag_finish\\\": false, \\\"window\\\": -1, \\\"checksum\\\": -1, \\\"urgent_pointer\\\": -1 }}}\" \"\"\"\r\n\r\nprint(line.replace('\\\"', '\"'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Right click->Run python file in terminal\r\n3. Copy data from terminal:\r\n```\r\n\"{ \"package\": {\"type\": \"tcp\", \"total_length\" :0, \"header_length\": 0, \"body_length\": 0, \"TCP\": {\"source\r\n_port\": -1, \"dest_port\": -1, \"seq_num\": -1, \"ack_num\": -1, \"flag_urgent\": false, \"flag_ack\": false, \"fl\r\nag_push\": false, \"flag_reset\": false, \"flag_sync\": false, \"flag_finish\": false, \"window\": -1, \"checksum\r\n\": -1, \"urgent_pointer\": -1 }}}\"\r\n```\r\nWords \"source_port\" and \"flag_push\" and quotes on ' \"checksum\" ' are changed.
