all the panel toggle commands hide the respective panel when it's visible and show it when it's hidden.

This means you don't have to hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>\\`</kbd> twice in order to get focus to the terminal when it's already displayed but not focused.

Yeah, right. But VS Code seems to be taking this rather too seriously and applying bad formatting to any HTML after a style attribute in HTML document, shifting every line after the rotten one to the left, therefore messing the indentation completely.\r\n\r\n## How to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open a new VS Code window\r\n2. Set language to HTML (Control+K, M then type HTML)\r\n3. Paste in the following code:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n<html>  \r\n    <body>\r\n        \r\n        <div style=\"border:1 px solid red\">I'm a block element</div>\r\n        <p>I'm a paragraph</p>\r\n        <p>I'm a second paragraph</p>\r\n        <p>I'm a third paragraph</p>\r\n    </body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n```\r\n4. Format code with Control+Shift+F\r\n\r\nAnd it's done! The code will look like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n<body>\r\n\r\n    <div style=\"border:1 px solid red\">I'm a block element</div>\r\n<p>I'm a paragraph</p>\r\n<p>I'm a second paragraph</p>\r\n<p>I'm a third paragraph</p>\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice the 3 empty lines and how the `<p>` tags have shifted leftwards?\r\n\r\nTested on version
