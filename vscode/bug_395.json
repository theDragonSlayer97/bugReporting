change uses `uri.with` to get a new version which has the same fields except no scheme. It also removes `paths.normalize` because the uri may be a URL, not a path, and that causes it to have \\ on windows. I don't know if that's safe or if `paths.normalize` is needed in some case. I also don't know whether the `if (resource.scheme === 'debug')` check is necessary.\r\n\r\nI think that embedding a URL or path or made up path like `<node_internals>/...` into a URI might be unsafe in other cases too, but I don't really know. Another approach would be to just `encodeURIComponent` the entire thing from the debugger, instead of trying to interpret it in vscode, and only decode it for display. I don't know whether there's anywhere that we need it to work like an actual URI?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23948","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23948/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23948/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23948/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23948","id":219661227,"number":23948,"title":"Release

Derived()` above) it jumps to the constructor function, and if the constructor function is defined in a parent class it jumps to the parent class and not to the class where the cursor was on, when you pressed F12.\r\n\r\nI know that technically you call the constructor function and not the class but from navigation point of view - you want to go to the class.

Press the [-] in the margin next to the `article` element to minimise it\r\n4.

Expected outcome:\r\n```\r\n      <article class=\"sflArticle sflContent-article\">...\r\n      </article>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt works fine if I indent the code, however when I do that it of course indents it on the web page too, which I don't want.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23936","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23936/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23936/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23936/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23936","id":219581992,"number":23936,"title":"The
