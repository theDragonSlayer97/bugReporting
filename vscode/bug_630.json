VSCode Version: 1.7.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 8.1\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI'm not sure where I read that, but I thought JS files should be treated as independent units by default (by default, I mean no jsconfig.json file). For some reason my VSCode is adding intellisense for non-imported variables across the project. As an example, let's say I have only these two simple files in a folder-project: \r\n\r\ntest1.js \r\n`var foo = 'test';`\r\n\r\ntest2.js\r\n`var foo = 10;`\r\n\r\nSo the thing is, I'm getting Intellisense for the wrong foo in test2.js: if I begin to type foo, it's only showing me String.prototype methods. From what I understood, it shouldn't work like that (could be wrong tho, I'm pretty new in VSCode), I want Intellisense only for explicit imported variables, with either commonjs require/es6 import.\r\n\r\nI even tried creating a jsconfig.json file, with *allowSyntheticDefaultImports* set to false in jsconfig, but still couldn't make it work the way I want.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n        \"target\": \"es6\",\r\n        \"allowSyntheticDefaultImports\": false\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16891","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16891/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16891/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16891/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16891","id":194239849,"number":16891,"title":"(?<=:).+ Is Considered As An Invalid Expression","user":{"login":"ArthurZ","id":701808,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/701808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ","html_url":"https://github.com/ArthurZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":421131022,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/as-designed","name":"as-designed","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-12-08T03:43:38Z","updated_at":"2016-12-08T07:58:23Z","closed_at":"2016-12-08T07:58:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.7.2 (7ba55c5860b152d999dda59393ca3ebeb1b5c85f, 2016-11-21T22:06:37.428Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\r\n- Extensions:\r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|rainbow-brackets|2gua|0.0.6|\r\n|Bookmarks|alefragnani|0.10.1|\r\n|vscode-color|anseki|0.2.2|\r\n|ruby-on-rails-snippets|atefth|0.0.1|\r\n|erb|CraigMaslowski|0.0.1|\r\n|LogFileHighlighter|emilast|1.0.1|\r\n|eq|eqela|1.0.0|\r\n|code-runner|formulahendry|0.6.2|\r\n|mdmath|goessner|0.9.0|\r\n|ruby|groksrc|0.0.6|\r\n|name-that-color|guillaumedoutriaux|0.0.1|\r\n|findfile|HastenS|0.0.4|\r\n|icon-fonts|idleberg|1.3.0|\r\n|markdown-toc|joffreykern|1.3.0|\r\n|markdown-table-formatter|josa|0.0.4|\r\n|mdhelper|joshbax|0.0.9|\r\n|vs-color-picker|lihui|0.3.2|\r\n|markdown-shortcuts|mdickin|0.5.0|\r\n|prettify-json|mohsen1|0.0.3|\r\n|mssql|ms-mssql|0.1.5|\r\n|PowerShell|ms-vscode|0.7.2|\r\n|Theme-MarkdownKit|ms-vscode|0.1.1|\r\n|color-highlight|naumovs|1.3.0|\r\n|copy-file-name|nemesv|1.0.0|\r\n|markdown-checkbox|PKief|1.0.2|\r\n|material-icon-theme|PKief|1.1.4|\r\n|Ruby|rebornix|0.10.4|\r\n|markdown-authoring|yanz|0.1.5|\r\n|markdown-pdf|yzane|0.1.4|\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

working on an extension that tries to put rich security guidance in front of developers as they introduce potential vulnerabilities, and there are a couple of improvements to the hover functionality of a diagnostic that would allow me to improve the overall experience with my extension\r\n\r\n1) It would be great to be able to make URLs in the hover into working links, instead of requiring someone to copy the text and paste it in the browser.  I'm reasonably constrained in the length of guidance I can put in a diagnostic, since the hover popup has a max width and height, so I include a URL off to more info on the problem being flagged.  However it would be a lot more usable if the user could just click on this URL and be off to the guidance\r\n\r\n2) I would really love to provide different text into the output window versus what I put in the hover window.  Currently, since the diagnostic source and message are echoed to both the output window and hover, but displayed very differently (single line in output vs. a decent sized area in the hover window) I'm in the position of offering a sub optimal experience in one area or the other  (for example, I abbreviate the severity of the security finding to Crit, Imp, Mod, etc. so that it fits well in the output window, but that terseness isn't necessary in the hover window)\r\n\r\nI know there is a desire to keep diagnostics lightweight, and I certainly agree with decisions to keep CSS styling out of the mix, but the two requests above would let me deliver a fair bit better user experience to users of my extension.
