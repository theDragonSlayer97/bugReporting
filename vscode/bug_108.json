So if I open a file and make a change there's potentially no way to get the file back to it's unchanged state without disabling the formatters since I always have to hit save even though I've undone all the changes.

looking for a way to change my VSCode Editor Minimap to behave more like the Atom Minimap.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, to have container opacity and variable height as the file grows in length. The opacity is what is most important to me, but the variable container length would help a lot as well.\r\n\r\nCurrently, my Atom minimap allows opacity and only grows in length as needed.  \r\n![capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21133719/29327005-e4b47bee-81aa-11e7-8cd9-52cb6411d8c0.JPG)\r\n\r\nWhile my VSCode minimap covers my code and maintains full pane height no matter how many lines are in the file. \r\n![capture1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21133719/29327030-f82e16b2-81aa-11e7-8107-07972643f65f.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried asking a question about this on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45685834/vscode-minimap-creating-opacitylimited-height-like-atom-minimap-package) and looking through these issues. So far the closest I've found to this question is issue [#21255](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21255), which points to issue [#21229](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21229) and then to issue [#21359](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21359), which lead to the implementation of a box shadow to make the minimap separation more prominent.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the box shadow doesn't allow me to recover that text editor width while keeping my minimap enabled. This makes the difference between being able to see all my code using 2 panes and having my code cut off by the minimap.\r\n\r\nI'm sure a lot of people transitioning from Atom to VSCode would appreciate being able to maintain this editor workspace, particularly when working with a lot of smaller files.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nAdding what information I can in case you consider feature implementation:\r\n\r\nAtom uses a gear icon that appears over the minimap on mouseover allows for 'absolute-mode' to be toggled on and off. This option toggles between a VSCode-like minimap and the one I showed above.\r\n![capture3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21133719/29331547-062e4f02-81ba-11e7-89a2-2bdfa4bc8e17.JPG)\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand of the VSCode design paradigm so far, I think a similar feature could be toggled as a User Setting such as `\"editor.minimap.absolutePosition\": true,`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32581/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32580","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32580/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32580/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32580/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32580","id":250374456,"number":32580,"title":"Using `code --install-extension abc` throws UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning and blocks installation","user":{"login":"vazexqi","id":54414,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/54414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vazexqi","html_url":"https://github.com/vazexqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vazexqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vazexqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vazexqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vazexqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vazexqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vazexqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vazexqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vazexqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vazexqi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":343063018,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/extensions","name":"extensions","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-08-15T17:00:10Z","updated_at":"2017-08-16T23:43:13Z","closed_at":"2017-08-16T23:43:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.15.0 (8b95971d8cccd3afd86b35d4a0e098c189294ff2, 2017-08-09T20:06:21.685Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 14.5.0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
