My Jekyll server threw this error:\n\n```\n[2016-09-21 09:49:59] ERROR Errno::ECONNRESET: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host. @ io_fillbuf - fd:6\n        C:/Ruby22/lib/ruby/2.2.0/webrick/httpserver.rb:80:in `eof?'\n        C:/Ruby22/lib/ruby/2.2.0/webrick/httpserver.rb:80:in `run'\n        C:/Ruby22/lib/ruby/2.2.0/webrick/server.rb:294:in `block in start_thread'\n```\n\nAfter some digging around, I discovered that VSCode was overriding my file’s original encoding settings (**Unicode UTF-8 without signature**), and changing it to **Unicode UTF-8** with signature. That hidden character does some goofy things with Jekyll/Ruby on Windows. Sometimes it can stop an entire site from building correctly. I had to open the files back up in vanilla VS and use the Advanced Save Options to re-encode the file. That fixed the error message.\n\nI doubt very many people are using the combination of VSCode and VS like I was, but it seems like preserving a user’s file settings should be a fairly important consideration for teams that have members on different operating systems. Barring that, VSCode needs a way to manually change the file encoding settings, similar to “Advanced Save Options” in VS. (That menu option might already exist, but I didn’t find it – clicking the “UTF-8” at the bottom of the screen pops the option to “Reopen with encoding” or “Save with encoding,” but doesn’t give me an obvious way to change the encoding.)\n\nThanks!
