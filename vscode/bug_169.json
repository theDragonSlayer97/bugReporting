for: Multi Root Workspaces\r\n\r\nComplexity: 5\r\n\r\n- [x] Windows @isidorn \r\n- [x] Linux @weinand\r\n- [x] macOS @chrisdias \r\n\r\nIn this milestone we rewrote how multi root workspaces surface in VS Code. The previous solution with having a `workspace` setting in user settings is obsolete (there is no migration). See https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/396#issuecomment-315079618 for more details on our approach.\r\n\r\n**Note:** to see the workspace name in the window title (helps for testing), configure `\"window.title\": \"${activeEditorShort}${separator}${rootName}\"`\r\n\r\n**Basics**\r\nMost workspace related operations center around a new submenu under the file menu:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/900690/28329168-25e080a4-6be9-11e7-826d-0d82d2ac5607.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nTry to work with multi root workspaces and play around with the available actions. Transition between empty workspaces, single folder workspaces and multi-root workspaces. Some things to keep an eye on:\r\n* explorer and search operations work as before in any of the contexts\r\n* you can save \"Untitled Workspace\" to some location on disk and open them from there\r\n* saving an untitled workspace works without requiring a window reload\r\n* you can switch saved workspaces via `File > Open Recent` as well as the recently opened picker (F1 `>open recent`)\r\n* you can add and remove root folders from a multi-root workspace\r\n* you see that you are inside a workspace by a new status bar color as well as the workspace name showing up in the explorer section for folders (only in our default dark and light theme)\r\n* workspaces that are opened will restore in the same way as folder do (you can set `window.restoreWindows: all` to restore multiple windows)\r\n* debugging (node.js and extension host debugging) work as before\r\n\r\n**Untitled Workspaces**\r\nWorkspaces that are not saved are called \"Untitled Workspace\". Verify:\r\n* you get asked to save an untitled workspace when you load something else into the window or when you open a second window and close the first window with the untitled workspace\r\n* all of the actions from the question dialog work\r\n* untitled workspaces (not just the last active window but all windows) restore properly the next time you start up\r\n\r\n**Data**\r\nOnce you are in a workspace context, we use the workspaces identifier to associate:\r\n* UI state (e.g. the files you have opened as tabs)\r\n* hot-exit state (e.g. dirty files you left dirty when quitting)\r\n* extension storage (a location on disk where extensions can store data via the [`ExtensionContext.storagePath`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L3513) API)\r\n\r\nVerify:\r\n* UI state you have inside a workspace is restored next time you open it\r\n* dirty files are restored when you quit and reopen the workspace\r\n* extensions have a stable `ExtensionContext.storagePath` location per workspace\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\nOnce you are in a workspace context, workspace settings are no longer stored within the `.vscode` folder, but within the workspace file. \r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Opening workspace settings in a Multi-root workspace currently shows the complete workspace config file. To show only Settings, is pending for next week.\r\n\r\n**Verify:**\r\n* Defining workspace settings applies to whole workspace as usual.\r\n* Defining folder settings applies to resources under that folder. Currently following resource settings are supported.\r\n\r\n```\r\neditor.*\r\nfiles.exclude\r\nfiles.trimTrailingWhitespace\r\nfiles.insertFinalNewLine\r\nfiles.encoding\r\nfiles.autoGuessEncoding\r\nfiles.watcherExclude\r\nsearch.exclude\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Intelli-sense in workspace settings works.\r\n* Edit actions in Default Settings works correctly in all targets.\r\n* Actions to open Folder settings in Command Pallette.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4383","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"E637:366F:C3DAE4:17DDB43:59D93409","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=170>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=168>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"08d36c8ae084307e7300d3c4e4d271b0\"","status":"200 OK"}}
