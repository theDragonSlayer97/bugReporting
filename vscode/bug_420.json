Maybe have the gear always drawn, and if the `tasks.json` doesn't exist, create one (basically the same behavior as the play button when `tasks.json` isn't present).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23199","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23199/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23199/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23199/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23199","id":216952578,"number":23199,"title":"[html]

I don't like the pane itself, but when collapsed the bar still has value by showing how many editors are unsaved (and could have more value if the icons didn't disappear).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23196","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23196/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23196/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23196/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23196","id":216946905,"number":23196,"title":"vsce publish timeout","user":{"login":"onixie","id":817073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/817073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onixie","html_url":"https://github.com/onixie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onixie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onixie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onixie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onixie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onixie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onixie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onixie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onixie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onixie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2017-03-25T03:47:48Z","updated_at":"2017-04-11T06:07:08Z","closed_at":"2017-03-27T14:29:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Couldn't detect the repository where this extension is published.

Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: MacOS Sierra\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHaha. No way. I tried. It's completely random. Crazy making.\r\n\r\nHere is the deal:\r\n\r\nI looked at a couple open issues about Undo History in this repo. You guys assert that the history is infinite unless the file is written to by another process. My experience conflicts with that. On several very frustrating occasions, I lose all Undo history right after I save. I do have a process that watches the file and updates the build after each save but that process does not modify the file itself, at least not in any way that I can tell visually or content wise. But even if it turns out to be some crazy thing on my end (maybe one of the tools opens and saves the file as is instead of just reading from it) the fact that an editor loses its Undo history is enough for me and most developers (trust me, when enough run into this) to dump this otherwise great piece of software.\r\n\r\nWould you consider being a normal editor like Sublime et al and preserve the Undo history in the same way those editors do? I've never had a single complaint in my whole adult life about something as trivial as this.\r\n\r\nPlease fix (something, not me)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23188","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23188/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23188/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23188/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23188","id":216914872,"number":23188,"title":"Provide

VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Anniversary\r\n\r\nIn the latest update of the PowerShell extension (0.11.0) we now use an integrated terminal that hosts the editing and debugging session.  One thing that we're missing now is the ability to be aware of breakpoint set in .ps1 files before the debugger is started.  Here's a scenario:\r\n\r\n1. The user opens up a new VS Code session with the PowerShell extension installed\r\n2. The user opens a .ps1 file for editing and the \"PowerShell Integrated Console\" opens\r\n3. The user adds breakpoints in the editor pane for the script file by clicking in the gutter\r\n4. The user runs the script in the Integrated Console by typing out its path and pressing enter.\r\n5. The script runs but none of the breakpoints are set.\r\n6. The user is confused, now presses F5 to debug the script.  The breakpoints are sent to the debug adapter which registers them in the session and then runs the script\r\n7. The breakpoints are now hit and the debugger UI stops correctly\r\n\r\nIdeally there'd be some event I could subscribe to and be notified when breakpoints are added to or removed from an open file when debugging isn't active.  This would allow me to send that information to my language service to be prepared for the user to execute the script outside of the debugger.\r\n\r\nIf there's another way you've thought of to make this work, I'd be very happy to hear it.  Having this capability would go a long way to reduce user confusion when debugging PowerShell scripts interactively.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n/cc @isidorn @weinand ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23187","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23187/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23187/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23187/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23187","id":216914249,"number":23187,"title":"[Test] typescript.tsserver.log","user":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/37","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/37","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/37/labels","id":2317844,"number":37,"title":"March 2017","description":"","creator":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":663,"state":"closed","created_at":"2017-02-13T07:33:31Z","updated_at":"2017-06-25T20:58:50Z","due_on":"2017-03-31T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-04-06T09:12:10Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-03-24T21:54:29Z","updated_at":"2017-03-29T04:18:44Z","closed_at":"2017-03-29T04:18:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Test Plan For #22915\r\n\r\n**OS**\r\n- [x] Linux - @mousetraps \r\n- [x] OSX - @jrieken \r\n- [x] Window - @waderyan \r\n\r\nCheck to see that the `typescript.tsserver.log` works as expected.\r\n\r\n1.

An example of where this confusion does not occur is the the High Contrast theme (because there are borders on the tab and tab with focus gets outlined with a different color) or Red theme (because the header is appropriately not the same color as the unfocused tab).\r\n\r\nI can provide screenshots if necessary for clarification.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23183","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23183/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23183/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23183/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23183","id":216908288,"number":23183,"title":"Cannot use mocha --run anymore","user":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-03-24T21:23:05Z","updated_at":"2017-03-27T08:34:36Z","closed_at":"2017-03-24T21:27:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"e.g.\r\n\r\n`mocha --run out\\vs\\editor\\test\\common\\controller\\cursor.test.js`\r\n\r\nWe should have a separate execution path for the glob case.

VSCode Version: 1.10.2 and HEAD (ba8799194d1a5e85f91418721ee295670e5d22b9)\r\n- OS Version: 10.12.3\r\n\r\nMy setup:\r\n1. Create an extension that listens to `onDidChangeTextDocument`.\r\n```\r\npublic onDidChangeTextDocument(ev: vscode.TextDocumentChangeEvent): void {\r\n\tconsole.log(JSON.stringify(ev.contentChanges));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Start debugging that extension in vscode.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce.\r\n1. Create a document with the contents \"abc\\n\"\r\n2. Place your cursor after \"c\" (before the \"\\n\")\r\n3. Press delete key once. Wait for a second.\r\n```\r\n[{\"range\":[{\"line\":0,\"character\":2},{\"line\":0,\"character\":3}],\"rangeLength\":1,\"text\":\"\"}]\r\n```\r\n4. Press delete key again. Wait for a second.\r\n```\r\n[{\"range\":[{\"line\":0,\"character\":1},{\"line\":0,\"character\":2}],\"rangeLength\":1,\"text\":\"\"}]\r\n```\r\n5. The document state is now \"a\\n\".\r\n6. Perform undo command (cmd+z). You editor should return to state \"abc\\n\" (as expected). If it doesn't you probably have an extension installed (e.g. vim) that is preventing this behavior. For the purpose of reproducing this bug, make sure you don't have an extension like this installed.\r\n```\r\n[\r\n{\"range\":[{\"line\":0,\"character\":1},{\"line\":0,\"character\":1}],\"rangeLength\":0,\"text\":\"b\"},\r\n{\"range\":[{\"line\":0,\"character\":2},{\"line\":0,\"character\":2}],\"rangeLength\":0,\"text\":\"c\"}\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23136#issuecomment-289083305, I should be able to apply the changes from step 6 \"at once\" on the document state from step 5. Doing so would result in the final document of \"ab\\nc\", which is incorrect.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23172","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23172/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23172/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23172/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23172","id":216867083,"number":23172,"title":"when you do save all, it pastes the last copied data into the current active editor","user":{"login":"telwagang","id":5006024,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5006024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/telwagang","html_url":"https://github.com/telwagang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/telwagang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/telwagang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/telwagang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/telwagang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/telwagang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/telwagang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/telwagang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/telwagang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/telwagang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-24T18:18:01Z","updated_at":"2017-03-25T05:51:01Z","closed_at":"2017-03-25T05:51:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.10.2 (8076a19fdcab7e1fc1707952d652f0bb6c6db331, 2017-03-08T13:56:35.908Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.4.0\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|beautify|HookyQR|0.8.4|\r\n|html-snippets|abusaidm|0.1.0|\r\n|vscode-caniuse|akamud|0.5.3|\r\n|jshint|dbaeumer|0.10.15|\r\n|vscode-eslint|dbaeumer|1.2.7|\r\n|javadebugger|donjayamanne|0.0.2|\r\n|tslint|eg2|0.8.1|\r\n|vscode-javac|georgewfraser|0.0.23|\r\n|vscode-JS-CSS-HTML-formatter|lonefy|0.2.2|\r\n|csharp|ms-vscode|1.7.0|\r\n|debugger-for-chrome|msjsdiag|2.5.3|\r\n|bootstrap-3-snippets|wcwhitehead|0.0.9|\r\n|Material-theme|zhuangtongfa|1.0.3|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.\r\n2.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4942","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"AF24:3670:A5E183:1ABB62A:59D938CF","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=421>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=419>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"e3b67bdd3f55c4e0e0a33eb047382d1d\"","status":"200 OK"}}
