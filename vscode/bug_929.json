wiki [instructions](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#build-and-run-from-source) say that I'll need Node.JS, at least version 5.10.   For unrelated reasons, I'm reluctant to install anything later than the latest [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts_schedule) release (v4.4.5) on the default PATH on my dev system.   \n\nIs v5.10 still the best release for working on vscode?   Any reason not use the 'Current' v6.2.2?\n\nIs it possible to setup and use a side-by-side version of Node.js for the purpose of contributing to vscode on the same machine where latest LTS-compatible tools are built?     Any recommended approach would be helpful?\n\nTIA \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7909","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7909/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7909/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7909/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7909","id":161343773,"number":7909,"title":"Emmet: support all the features","user":{"login":"yisibl","id":2784308,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2784308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yisibl","html_url":"https://github.com/yisibl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yisibl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yisibl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yisibl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yisibl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yisibl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yisibl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yisibl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yisibl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yisibl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"egamma","id":172399,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/172399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma","html_url":"https://github.com/egamma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"egamma","id":172399,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/172399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma","html_url":"https://github.com/egamma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-06-21T03:47:15Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T14:22:49Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T14:22:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Now we only support:\n- Expand Abbreviation\n- Wrap with Abbreviation\n- Remove Tag\n- Update Tag\n\n@egamma Are you planning to support [other features](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet/blob/master/lib/action/main.js#L75-L95)?

Clicking it caused the terminal to reset but I wasn't sure why until I hovered over the button to read the pop-up text. \n\nConsidering that there is no UI concept of tabs, multiple terminals, or ordering of the same, the back and forward buttons are similarly hard to reason about. They also apparently cycle around but since I have no idea how many terminals I have open without \n\nA \"minus\" button does not say to me that it would \"close\" a terminal. Not sure what I was expecting it to do. I understand there would be an overlap with the X for close (X already closes the pane).\n\nIt was not clear to me whether pressing the X (hover text: \"Close\") would close all terminals or just close \"hide\" the Terminal pane.

I found that the `disconnect` request calls `cancel()` on all sent promises.\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/c5429332d4ac326a94a6c5e87fffefcb14d10e84/src/vs/workbench/parts/debug/node/rawDebugSession.ts#L261\n\nThis is the exception that is causing the error in the VSCode UI\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/bfb5b806e4f0328102bde3fd8750e63c66c2f19a/src/vs/base/common/winjs.base.raw.js#L1654\n\nIt doesn't seem like the promises that are being pushed into `sentPromises` have an `onCancel()` handler\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/81050abedbe54597b9506609eb5b7cb916ddc9c6/src/vs/workbench/parts/debug/node/v8Protocol.ts#L44\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/bfb5b806e4f0328102bde3fd8750e63c66c2f19a/src/vs/base/common/winjs.base.d.ts#L64\n\n@isidorn \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7905","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7905/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7905/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7905/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7905","id":161319349,"number":7905,"title":"Allow configuring language explicitly","user":{"login":"mprobst","id":7208,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprobst","html_url":"https://github.com/mprobst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprobst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprobst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprobst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprobst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprobst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprobst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprobst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprobst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprobst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-06-20T23:34:53Z","updated_at":"2016-06-22T08:59:21Z","closed_at":"2016-06-21T07:36:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.2.1 (1.2.1)\n- OS Version: Mac OS X 10.11.5 (15F34)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

So for example, when I'm editing README.md, I sort of hope that F1 to produce a Markdown cheat sheet.\n\nWhile I appreciate the command pallet that F1 currently invokes in VSCode, it can be invoked by other means (e.g. **Ctrl+Shift+P**), and some interesting expectations seem to have come from mapping F1 to the command pallet.   #7269.  \n\nI couldn't agree more that an F key shortcut is justified, perhaps **F4** would be a better mapping for displaying the command pallet given the traditional Windows UI guidelines.   **F4** has long been used in contexts such as a combo-box to display a list of alternatives.   See [Guidelines for Keyboard User Interface Design](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms971323.aspx).
