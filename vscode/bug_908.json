Keep `Option/Alt` pressed and hover of menu actions\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8532","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8532/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8532/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8532/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8532","id":162995782,"number":8532,"title":"VS code launch problem","user":{"login":"Mugesh-Rajaram","id":16976667,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16976667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugesh-Rajaram","html_url":"https://github.com/Mugesh-Rajaram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugesh-Rajaram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugesh-Rajaram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugesh-Rajaram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugesh-Rajaram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugesh-Rajaram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugesh-Rajaram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugesh-Rajaram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugesh-Rajaram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugesh-Rajaram/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-06-29T18:34:03Z","updated_at":"2016-06-30T05:26:52Z","closed_at":"2016-06-30T05:26:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: V1.1.1\n- OS Version: Windows 8.1\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
