VSCode Version: 1.9\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Enterprise version 1607\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Typescript File (.ts)\r\n2. Paste this code in the editor:\r\n// bar typed by VSCode (with 'es2015.promise lib configuration) -- Promise<void>\r\n// bar typed by VSCode with 'es6-promise' module -- Promise<string>\r\n// bar typed by Typescript Playground -- Promise<number | string>\r\nlet bar = Promise.resolve()\r\n    .then(() => 5)\r\n    .catch(() => {\r\n        return 'true';\r\n    });\r\n\r\n// foo typed by VSCode (with 'es2015.promise lib configuration) -- Promise<{}>\r\n// foo typed by VSCode with 'es6-promise' module -- Promise <any>\r\n// foo typed by Typescript Playground -- Promise <string>\r\nlet foo = Promise\r\n    .resolve(5)\r\n    .then(() => 'test')\r\n    .catch(() => {\r\n        return Promise.reject(false);\r\n    });\r\n\r\nThe typings for the Promises don't match what I would expect them to (compared to [https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/) which does the right thing.  I was using npm module 'es6-promise' instead of including a polyfill, but switched to trying the --lib declaration for 'es2015.promise' in my tsconfig file.  Both cases gave me different typings for the Promise, but both were wrong and didn't match Typescripts playground.\r\n\r\nIs this a known issue or is there some other combination of configurations that I can use to get correctly typed Promises?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19881","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19881/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19881/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19881/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19881","id":205285527,"number":19881,"title":"Can't

I have my own module, that I host on a private git server that I install via npm's git+ssh support and it doesn't change ``\"types\"`` into ``\"typescript.definition\"`` and in this case VSCode does pick up my local typings alright.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19868","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19868/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19868/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19868/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19868","id":205242305,"number":19868,"title":"Bulk comment / uncomment is broken in certain cases","user":{"login":"johnbrett","id":4015939,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4015939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnbrett","html_url":"https://github.com/johnbrett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnbrett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnbrett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnbrett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnbrett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnbrett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnbrett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnbrett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnbrett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnbrett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-02-03T19:05:52Z","updated_at":"2017-05-11T02:23:05Z","closed_at":"2017-02-06T17:16:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.9.0 (27240e71ef390bf2d66307e677c2a333cebf75af, 2017-02-02T08:23:30.856Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.4.0\r\n- Extensions:\r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|vscode-wakatime|WakaTime|1.0.6|\r\n|node-module-intellisense|leizongmin|1.3.0|\r\n|Theme-GitHubCleanWhite|saviorisdead|0.0.3|\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Highlight multiple a block of code like example below, and press `cmd` + `/`, it creates the following *multiline* comment:\r\n````javascript\r\n/*if (foo === 'has long contents') {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n       test\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}*/\r\n````\r\nThe problem here is if you press `cmd` + `/` again, it actually **adds extra inline comments** instead of removing the code block just added.\r\n\r\n// NOTE, doesn't happen for all cases, the following still works correctly (not `test` is inline this time, as opposed to its own line).\r\n\r\n````javascript\r\n//  if (foo === 'has long contents') {\r\n//    return (\r\n//      <div>test</div>\r\n//    )\r\n//  }\r\n````\r\n\r\nI've only noticed this since the latest update, 1.9.0. \r\n\r\nBTW - I absolute LOVE VSCode - you people rock.
