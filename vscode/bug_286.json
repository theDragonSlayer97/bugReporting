\r\n\r\nI thought I'd try to see if I can add this feature. I have something that's working in the one test that I added and I got some questions so I figured I'd open up a PR early, maybe get some pointers on some stuff that I'm not sure how to add? Hope that's ok. I didn't think StackOverflow or Gitter was the best place to ask questions about the codebase.\r\n\r\n### Feature description\r\nBy changing the key `editor.leadingCommas` to `true`, the JSON formatter will format documents with a leading comma like so:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{ \"a\": null\r\n, \"b\": null\r\n, \"c\": null\r\n,}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Things I haven't figured out and am not sure where to ask 😬\r\n- Show `editor.leadingCommas` in user/workspace settings. Not sure why this isn't showing up. I thought adding the key in [`commonEditorConfig.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/compare/master...koddsson:add-leading-commas-json-formatting-option?expand=1#diff-6728189afcd9d7e37ec62aa3e7e67056R232-R236) would do the trick but so far I can't see it when running `./scripts/code.sh`.\r\n- Manually test to see this working. When running `./scripts/code.sh` I get a editor and I can see the code in the Developer Tools but I can't get my breakpoints to hit so I can debug why the formatter actually isn't working in the editor\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/318208/26426777/04fd9b70-40d2-11e7-88c8-862505b3976f.png)\r\n- Moving the settings key from `editor.leadingCommas` to something like `json.format.leadingCommas`? I figured I'd get this working first and then I can move it.\r\n- Add more test cases. My one test case is maybe not enough to cover all the cases we wanna cover.\r\n\r\nI hope this is cool and it's not just more noise for you maintainers 😺

The tab tooltip shows that the path is different from original one in the case, e.g. the original path is \"C:\\Projects\\Project\\file.ts\" but the duplicate has \"C:\\projects\\project\\file.ts\".\r\n\r\nExpected\r\nThe files should be presented once in the list and the paths should correspond to OS ones.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to fix it? As that behavior often leads me to a difference in the content of same file if I use \"Go to File...\" to switch between tabs. And I cannot determine the path difference in recently opened list.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n* If I try to find files by pattern containing folder name, e.g. \"proj file\", then the recently opened list is empty and the file results one contains the single match (no duplicate).\r\n* I tried to clear the recent files, no success.\r\n* I tried to disable all extensions, no success.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27205","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27205/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27205/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27205/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27205","id":231084367,"number":27205,"title":"Request: Add two software languages, and IntelliSense for both","user":{"login":"Software-Engineer-CodewareBI","id":28928376,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/28928376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Software-Engineer-CodewareBI","html_url":"https://github.com/Software-Engineer-CodewareBI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Software-Engineer-CodewareBI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Software-Engineer-CodewareBI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Software-Engineer-CodewareBI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Software-Engineer-CodewareBI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Software-Engineer-CodewareBI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Software-Engineer-CodewareBI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Software-Engineer-CodewareBI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Software-Engineer-CodewareBI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Software-Engineer-CodewareBI/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":293379998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/languages%20basic","name":"languages basic","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-05-24T15:41:06Z","updated_at":"2017-07-25T23:33:25Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Considering the effort that Microsoft's development team has put forward to produce the Power BI desktop and service suite, it makes sense to me that Visual Studio Code should recognize DAX (*.dax) files and M-language (*.m) files.\r\n\r\nWhen can we expect DAX and M to be supported?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27205/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4266","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"E9BA:3670:A4C678:1A8B561:59D9362D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=287>;
