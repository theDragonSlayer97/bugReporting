of all: Thanks for VSCode and open sourcing it. It's on a good road to becoming my favourite editor and also introduced me to TypeScript, which is really awesome, too!\n\nWhen developing for Meteor with VSCode it often appears that there are some undefined variables, like `Template` or `Meteor`. Of course these variables are not defined in the one of the many files in my project, since they are part of the framework themselves.\n\nI already downloaded the `.d.ts` files from http://definitelytyped.org - and VSCode already recognises them. I.e. it gives hints for function params and I can go to the definition of the variable when CMD-clicking the variable.\n\n<img width=\"274\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-02-20 at 12 46 47\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/498359/13196516/128c8c2c-d7d0-11e5-8e10-30915f2a8ae9.png\">\n\nAs can be seen in the the screenshot this (of course) also appears to packages that have been installed via `meteor add` (here it's the i18n package).\n\nJust to be clear: In meteor it's not an issue, since all files get automatically bundled in meteors automatic build process.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3193","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3193/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3193/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3193/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3193","id":135058922,"number":3193,"title":"Documentation of installer tasks","user":{"login":"pascalberger","id":2190718,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2190718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalberger","html_url":"https://github.com/pascalberger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalberger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalberger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalberger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalberger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalberger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalberger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalberger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalberger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalberger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":296817653,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/install-update","name":"install-update","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-02-20T10:36:32Z","updated_at":"2016-02-22T09:25:53Z","closed_at":"2016-02-22T09:25:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I would like to enhance the existing Chocolatey package for Visual Studio Code with the parameters already available in the installer (for context menu, icon, etc, see https://github.com/iozag/chocolatey-packages/issues/18).
