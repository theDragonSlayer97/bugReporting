the term \"ruler\" is used for two distinct concepts. One of them is effectively a thin vertical line (as in `editor.rulers`), and the other is the \"[overview ruler](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_errors-warnings)\", which isn't a line at all. Honestly I don't think \"overview ruler\" is an intuitive name. I think something like \"scrollbar overlay\" would convey the meaning much more clearly.\r\n\r\nTo add to the confusion, there are other thin vertical lines that are not called \"rulers\", but \"guides\" (i.e. the indentation guides). I don't think this distinction is problematic, since such guides are local and contextual, whereas rulers (in the sense used by \"editor.rulers\") are global and span the entire height of the editor. But I'd be OK if instead it was decided to rename \"editor.rulers\" to \"editor.guides\", since that would resolve the ambiguity as well.\r\n\r\nNote that #30609 would depend on the choice made here,

on **41%**! (currently main reason of slow installation - count of files)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4379","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"A5D5:4299:5778C3:C320EC:59D9341A","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=174>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=172>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"ee2d68dccd6ad78cd6976682b928d707\"","status":"200 OK"}}
