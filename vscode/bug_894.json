Hover over the close button of the tab until a popup appears `Close`\n\nI think it would be nice of the keybinding (default <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd>) was shown in the hover popup label. Same goes for the `Close all` action when pressing the 3 dots on the side of the panel.\n\nIf I find some time I will do a PR for this if you guys agree on it.\n\n// @bpasero

Right-click on a `bower_components` folder and choose \"Find in Folder\"\n\nSince the folder is excluded through settings, no results will show in your searches. \n\nWhat I would expect is that if an absolute path \"files to include\" (not glob) would be completely excluded by the exclude settings, it would prefer the includes.
