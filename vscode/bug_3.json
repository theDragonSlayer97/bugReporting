According to the same URL, I was expecting these to be auto-detected as well - they are not.\r\n\r\nSo I create my own task. After quite a bit of fixing the standard templates (they have `taskName`, for instance), I ended up with this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n      \"group\": {\r\n        \"kind\": \"build\",\r\n        \"isDefault\": true\r\n      },\r\n      \"label\": \"build\",\r\n      \"type\": \"npm\",\r\n      \"script\": \"build\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this task is still not being detected. If I *Run Build Task* from the menu, the message says \"No build task to run found\".\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35733","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35733/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35733/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35733/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35733","id":263479523,"number":35733,"title":"Double character when typing accents on macOS","user":{"login":"verekia","id":522007,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/522007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/verekia","html_url":"https://github.com/verekia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verekia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verekia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verekia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verekia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verekia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verekia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verekia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verekia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verekia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":550883423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-input","name":"editor-input","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-10-06T15:11:18Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T15:46:55Z","closed_at":"2017-10-06T15:46:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.16.1\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.12\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

takýmto spôsobom otvoríte extension marketplace list, a zároveň počas načitávania extensions bude naďaľej rýchlo skrývať a zobrazovať ikony v Activiry Bar, tak občas sa stane že sa naďalej graficky bude ukazovať ikona v activity bar, niekedy funguje na ňu kliknúť, niekedy nie, ovšem v zoznamu \"show/hide\" nieje pri danej ikone/položke fajka. Alebo naopak je, ale ikona / položka sa nezobrazuje, niekedy ovšem keď kliknete na prázdne miesto v activity bar, otvoríte aj skrytú položku. Problém je s reprodukovaním, pretože sa to udeje náhodne a len občas / zriedkavo. Ak sa to stane, tak celý panel a aktivity bar je zabugovaný až kým nevypnete a znova nezapnete vscode.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[EN - translated by google translator]\r\n\r\nIf you hide and display icons in the activity bar very quickly, so the one that was last exposed or the one that is hidden is usually in the panel, but if you open the extension marketplace list, you will also be able to open the extension extensions to quickly hide and display icons in the Activiry Bar, sometimes it happens that the icon in the activity bar will continue to be shown graphically, sometimes it's clickable on it, sometimes not, but in the \"show / hide\" list it is not the icon / brier item. Or vice versa, but the icon / item is not displayed, but sometimes when you click on a blank space in the activity bar, you also open the hidden item. The problem is with reproduction because it happens at random and only occasionally / rarely. If this happens, the entire panel and activity bar is bugged, you must close and again open vscode to fix it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\n![screenshot_84](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31345346/31278489-67d78822-aaa5-11e7-8b4e-169357ce8117.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n[lang = \"CZ/SK\"]\r\nP.s.
