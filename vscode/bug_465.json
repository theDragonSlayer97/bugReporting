If I use  .NET Core Launch (console) or Launch Chrome they work fine by themselves.\r\n4. If I use the Debug in Chrome (or Edge or Firefox) VS Code gives me an error saying that the configuration \"Launch Chrome\" doesn't exist in my launch.json which it clearly does.\r\n5. If I move the compounds to the bottom of the file it doesn't matter. No matter what it gives the same error.\r\n6. If I change the order of the configurations so that the Launch Chrome configuration is first this works and both launch but if you interact with the browser at all it crashes.\r\n7. Also note that the browser starts before the .NET Core Launch (console) is finished starting. It's important that this waits otherwise you end up having to refresh the browser after it finishes building and running the .net core solution even if this was to work. (it would be better if the .NET core Launch (web) instead of launching browser could launch another configuration so that it was clear when it was done and then ran the second one automatically (i.e. all of the configurations should allow that once done to run additional configurations in a nested style (recursively)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21837","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21837/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21837/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21837/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21837","id":211537084,"number":21837,"title":"Feature request: Add option for current opened file's directory to 'terminal.integrated.cwd'","user":{"login":"Splike","id":7159527,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7159527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splike","html_url":"https://github.com/Splike","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splike/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splike/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splike/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splike/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splike/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splike/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splike/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splike/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splike/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":427411234,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/extension-candidate","name":"extension-candidate","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-02T22:23:41Z","updated_at":"2017-03-03T16:52:42Z","closed_at":"2017-03-03T16:52:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Currently when opening the integrated terminal, we have two options for the default terminal path:\r\n1.

Do you have a question?

The higher level directories appear below the pasted directory, and the pasted directory appears in the \"normal\" part of the file tree. Moreover, the pasted directory appears to be open in the \"normal\" part of the tree, but it's contents are not located below the pasted directory's name. Hopefully the clip below will provide some clarification.\r\n\r\n![file_copy_messes_up_file_tree](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3226984/23527325/58b4b5ce-ff4a-11e6-9740-7554fd61f25b.gif)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript\r\ncd TypeScript\r\ncode .\r\n```\r\n2. Right click to copy some file under `tests/cases/fourslash`. For sake of consistency, use `tests/cases/fourslash/breakpointValidationDo.ts`\r\n3. Right click paste the file under the directory `tests/cases/fourslash`. Note that `tests/cases/fourslash` must be expanded for the bug to occur.\r\n4.
