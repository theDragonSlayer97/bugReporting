So I wrote a custom `RenameProvider` and added it via `c.subscriptions.push(languages.registerRenameProvider({ language: \"typescript\", scheme: \"file\", pattern: \"**/*.controller.ts\" }, new CallbackRenameProvider()));`. \r\n\r\nut my provider seems to override the result of the `RenameProvider` of the typescript extension. Is there a possibility to have them both coexist? The problem is, if the method is used in another method in the typescript files it will not be renamed there.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Create a custom `RenameProvider` (for example for typescript)\r\n2. Successfully return the `WorkspaceEdit`\r\n3. Rename a method on a class and do some edits somewhere else\r\n\r\n**Expected Result:**\r\nThe typescript rename provider should rename the symbol in the other file (in my example xml) and the symbol on the typescript class.\r\n\r\n**Actual Result:**\r\nThe text in the other file does get renamed, but the method name stays the same.\r\nIf I deactivate my provider, it does get renamed.\r\nIt seems to me my WorkspaceEdit replaces the WorkspaceEdit provided by the typescript extension.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know, if you need some examples, then I can publish my extension and you can check it out yourself.\r\n\r\nFor now here is my repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/apazureck/openui5vscodeTypescriptTools (checkout the develop branch, please)\r\n\r\nAnd here is a test

does not respect `type: \"node2\"` when the configuration supplies `type: \"node\"`, as it happens in the embedded extension for node.js debugging.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nVisual Studio Code tracing shows that the embedded extension for node.js debugging actually uses `type: \"node2\"`, even when the auto-generated file \"launch.json\" provides `type: \"node\"`. Moreover, `type: \"node\"` if supplied to the \"complex command\" \"vscode.startDebug\" does not work anymore (see steps to reproduce below).\r\n\r\nThis is very confusing and not documented. The cases of \"node2\" and \"node\" should be merged to eliminate \"node2\". In worst case, this peculiarity should be thoroughly documented.\r\n\r\nRelated to [24762](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24762).\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n### 0) Use node.js 8.1.4\r\n\r\n### 1) Try node.js debugging with \"launch.json\":\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n    \"configurations\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": \"Launch Extension\",\r\n            \"type\": \"extensionHost\",\r\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n            \"program\": \"${file}\",\r\n            \"protocol\": \"auto\" // anything but \"legacy\"\r\n            ],\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt does work.\r\n\r\n### 2) Now, in some extension code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        const launchConfiguration = {\r\n            type: \"node\", // a real confusion! found by tracing Visual Studio Code\r\n            name: \"Launch Extension\",\r\n            request: \"launch\",\r\n            stopOnEntry: false,\r\n            protocol: \"auto\"\r\n        };\r\n        vscode.commands.executeCommand(\"vscode.startDebug\", launchConfiguration);\r\n```\r\nIt shows the error:\r\n> [DEP0062] DeprecationWarning: `node --debug` and `node --debug-brk` are invalid. Please use `node --inspect` or `node --inspect-brk` instead\r\n\r\nEven when the protocol is specified explicitly, the problem is the same:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        const launchConfiguration = {\r\n            type: \"node\", // a real confusion! found by tracing Visual Studio Code\r\n            name: \"Launch Extension\",\r\n            request: \"launch\",\r\n            stopOnEntry: false,\r\n            protocol: \"inspector\"\r\n        };\r\n        vscode.commands.executeCommand(\"vscode.startDebug\", launchConfiguration);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy documentation and logically, the type \"`node`\" should work. See also below.\r\n\r\n### 3) The workaround:\r\n\r\nChange `type: \"node\"` to `type: \"node2\"`. It works. But this is not a real solution, because \"officially\", only `type: \"node\"` is supported. I do understand that operation with `type: \"node2\"` may eventually fail with some VSCode update.\r\n\r\n## \r\nReproduces without extensions: No (the problem appears in extension, more exactly)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31265","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31265/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31265/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31265/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31265","id":244871666,"number":31265,"title":"error C2397: conversion from 'intmax_t' to '::size_t' requires a narrowing conversion should be warning","user":{"login":"jmichae3","id":5070356,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5070356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmichae3","html_url":"https://github.com/jmichae3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmichae3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmichae3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmichae3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmichae3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmichae3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmichae3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmichae3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmichae3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmichae3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":409283388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/caused-by-extension","name":"caused-by-extension","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-07-22T21:07:39Z","updated_at":"2017-07-24T07:40:05Z","closed_at":"2017-07-24T07:40:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

When I am navigating about the files in my project, I often only have 1 or 2 files that I am currently editing, several files open in other tabs and one tab that I am using to browse other files. When you have a really long list of files in the explorer, sometimes going back to a file you had open in the tab after <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+`Left Click`ing into a definition or simply browsing a bit can be a PITA.\r\n\r\nOpening files like this in the current tab is great to avoid clutter, but wouldn't it be cool if we had Forward `>` and Back `<` text icons that sat in the same bar as the menu, but adjusted to the position of the currently opened tab?
