Obviously, then I'll want all the cool features like regexp search and highlighting, but I believe that this can be nicely abstracted at the fs level.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9832/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":14,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9831","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9831/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9831/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9831/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9831","id":167777100,"number":9831,"title":"The .NET CLI tools cannot be located","user":{"login":"Tobyee","id":1400574,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1400574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tobyee","html_url":"https://github.com/Tobyee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tobyee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tobyee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tobyee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tobyee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tobyee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tobyee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tobyee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tobyee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tobyee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-27T05:56:55Z","updated_at":"2016-07-27T07:18:03Z","closed_at":"2016-07-27T07:18:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.3.1\n- OS Version: Win7-x64\n- dotnet Version: 1.0.0-beta-001598\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. cmd: mkdir demo & cd demo\n2. cmd: dotnet new\n3. cmd: dotnet restore\n4. cmd: code .\n\nError:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1400574/17165279/e21fc9d8-5401-11e6-8b2c-8bd0b94d4628.png)\n\nI'am sure that  .NET Core SDK for Windows was installed and `dotnet` command can be execute in `cmd`.\n\nSee alse:\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/3858\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9830","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9830/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9830/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9830/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9830","id":167776027,"number":9830,"title":"Question : How to delete all the available snippets from VS code ?

#9153 (test plan #9702)\n\nusing https://github.com/chrisdias/vscode-opennewinstance\n\nhere is my menus contribution:\n\n``` json\n\"menus\": {\n            \"explorer/context\": [\n                {\n                    \"command\": \"extension.openNewInstance\"\n                    ,\"group\": \"navigation\"\n\n                },\n                {\n                    \"command\":

Reveal in Finder\n> Open in Terminal\n> **Open New Workbench Here**\n> **Scope Workbench to Here**\n\nScenario: I want to move the second menu to the top of the list.  I set up my menus contribution to look like this:\n\n``` json\n\"menus\": {\n            \"explorer/context\": [\n                {\n                    \"command\": \"extension.openNewInstance\"\n

           }\n            ]\n        }\n```\n\nExpected: Given that \"Legacy commands have the implicit order of zero (navigation@0)\" I expected only the menu item that has a weighting < 0 to move to the top of the list, such as:\n\n> **Scope Workbench to Here** (@-1)\n> Open to the Side\n> Reveal in Finder\n> Open in Terminal\n> **Open New Workbench Here**  (no order specified)\n\nHowever, it looks like this:\n\n> **Open New Workbench Here**  (no order specified)\n> **Scope Workbench to Here** (order @-1)\n> Open to the Side\n> Reveal in Finder\n> Open in Terminal\n\nHowever, if I change the ordering as follows, where the first menu item has no ordering but the second does:\n\n``` json\n        \"menus\": {\n            \"explorer/context\": [\n                {\n                    \"command\": \"extension.openNewInstance\"\n                    ,\"group\": \"navigation\"\n\n                },\n                {\n                    \"command\": \"extension.scopeToHere\"\n                    ,\"group\": \"navigation@1\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n```\n\nThe result in this:\n\n> **Open New Workbench Here** (no order specified, why did this move to the top of the list??)\n> Open to the Side\n> Reveal in Finder\n> Open in Terminal\n> **Scope Workbench to Here** (order of @1)\n\nI dont understand why the first menu is now at the top of the list, while i can see the second one is at the bottom of the list (because @1 is > @0).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9828","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9828/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9828/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9828/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9828","id":167769137,"number":9828,"title":"Hi,

Many hours of fun after, i install the theme in my local machine with VS Code and i needed to change almost all set scopes to get what i want. \nWell, after all, remained some details which I suspect that are a problem in the way the VS Code identifies and applies the styles to each scope.\nThe code of my theme can be found in my [repository](https://github.com/AeonDigital/Code-Editor-Themes/tree/master/theme-aeondigital-dark). \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nFirst of all, install the theme (you can use \"ext install theme-aeondigital-dark\")\n\n**Using *.php files will work**\n1. Create a new *.php file and put some HTML tags inside. You can use a [sample of my repository](https://github.com/AeonDigital/Code-Editor-Themes/tree/master/sample-files). \n2. Set a \"script\" and/or \"style\" tags in the file and copy some kind of valid code inside each (use the samples ;-) ).\n\nIn this case all styles defined will work as expected! \\o/\n\n**But using *.html or *.js has some bugs**\n1. After install the theme, create a *.html or *.htm file and put the same HTML tested above and you can see that all tags will be in the same color and the properties value don´t \"get\" the right color.\n2. With *.js files has a similar trouble with the quoted strings. The definited color don´t \"get\" as expected.\n\n---\n\nI´m new user of the VS Code but i'm already loving it.\nCongratulations to the whole team.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9817","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9817/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9817/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9817/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9817","id":167729974,"number":9817,"title":"Up and down arrows work on shell history and the IME proposal window at the same time.","user":{"login":"kieferrm","id":4674940,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4674940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm","html_url":"https://github.com/kieferrm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":341269814,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/i18n","name":"i18n","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":286886536,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-07-26T22:45:55Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T18:42:57Z","closed_at":"2016-08-08T18:42:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Testing #9695 on MacOS:\n\nDisclaimer: I don't really know what I'm using IME, I don't speak any of those languages.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1)  Configure your keyboard:\n\n<img width=\"678\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-07-26 at 3 36 00 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4674940/17157800/b82c68c2-5346-11e6-8bd6-28f41e7ebda8.png\">\n\n2) See screen recording: I'm typing a rather random sequence of key strokes and sometimes select another proposal using the `down arrow` followed by `space` to insert it. \n\n3) When the selection is at the top of the proposal window and I type `up arrow` the shell goes back in history. This might or might not be the right thing.
