The ruler only shows on the right pane.\r\n\r\nThis changes even further when reducing the ruler to 80 characters. All of the problems go away.\r\nI thought at first it was being hidden behind the mini map, but when in full resolution (1920x1080) and having a single file. There is more than enough space to render the ruler as it renders just fine with the side bar open.\r\n\r\nIt has no problems rendering in a single pane or both panes with something smaller like 80.

140.\r\n\r\n![no_ruler1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2420177/24051582/8670efa2-0b00-11e7-962f-529fb0004cb5.png)\r\n\r\n![ruler1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2420177/24051557/6f273e3c-0b00-11e7-9f9d-e0e9f6f7cf27.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22800","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22800/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22800/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22800/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22800","id":215043111,"number":22800,"title":"\"3Iniciar\"
