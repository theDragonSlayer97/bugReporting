Run `npm init -y`. Create an empty ts file\r\n1. Verify version selector only have one option\r\n\r\n**User Setting**\r\n1. In your user settings, point `typescript.tsdk` to a global TS install using an absolute path\r\n1. Confirm you still only have one entry in the selector\r\n1. The server should now be using this version\r\n1. Set `typescript.tsdk` to an invalid path. An error message should be shown and we should fallback to the bundled ts version\r\n\r\n**Local TS**\r\n1.

Set `typescript.tsdk` to `node_modules/typescript/lib`\r\n1. Version selector should have two entries, one for VSCode's version and one for the local version\r\n1. Try setting the user tsdk value to an invalid path. You should still see this in the selector but get an warning message when trying to use it\r\n\r\n**Local TSDK using foldername**\r\n1. Set local `typescript.tsdk` to `FOLDER_NAME/node_modules/typescript/lib`\r\n1. confirm forms of this syntax work as expected.\r\n\r\n**Workspace TSDK setting**\r\n1. Convert folder into a workspace.\r\n1. Ensure  workspace level setting of `typescript.tsdk` to `FOLDER_NAME/node_modules/typescript/lib` works\r\n1. Add more folders to the workspace and try pointing at TS installs in them\r\n\r\n**Workspace npm versions**\r\n1. In a workspace with multiple folders\r\n1. Remove all local `typescript.tsdk` setting values\r\n1. Make sure typescript is installed under `node_modules` in several of the folders\r\n1. The version selector should now show entries for each of these. \r\n1. Selecting one should update the workspace `typescript.tsdk` setting\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31784","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31784/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31784/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31784/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31784","id":246891998,"number":31784,"title":"Test:
