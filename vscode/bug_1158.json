https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/141, there appears to still be an issue with how env vars are passed into Code, even after the fix for https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/560.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. have `export FOO=1` in your `.bash_profile`\n2. ensure your function to start visual studio code looks like this `code () { VSCODE_CWD=\"$PWD\" open -n -b \"com.microsoft.VSCode\" --args $* ;}`\n3.  open a terminal session\n4.  `export FOO=2` in your terminal session\n5.  open `code .`\n6. open developer tools, and eval `process.env[\"FOO\"]`\n\nExpected: `Foo` should be `2`\nResult: `FOO` will be `1`\n\nBut the thing that's really odd is that if you skip step (1) (remove this from you `.bash_profile`), you will see `Foo` set to `2`.  So in that case, the local environment is getting passed in.  \n\nIt seems like this must be either a problem with how vscode is setting up the env vars, or how `open` in OS X
