Typescript file, Monokai theme\r\n2. Make a class with a function, use the `this` and `super` keyword, etc.\r\n3. Recognize the lack of proper highlighting.\r\n\r\nQuite a lot of things where changed between 1.6 and 1.7(.1), including the `=>` in lambdas being blue instead of red now, most methods being green when calling them (but sometimes they are blue, like `getAll`, `get`, `set`, `push`, `forEach`, `navigate`, `apply`, `sub`, `sup`, `anchor`, `big`, etc), some fields being blue (but not all; i.e. `x`, `y`, `z`, `length`, `title`, `all`, and `id` are blue, all of `console`'s methods, all of `document`'s methods, etc), and some lonely keywords being blue as well (i.e. `event`; I can understand the blue-ing of `document` and `console`).\r\n\r\nA couple other issues I found was with the `instanceof` operator; `foo instanceof String` makes `String` blue (same with `Array`), whereas in `foo instanceof Class` (where Class is a user-made class) `Class` is still a standard white; not even an underlined green!\r\n\r\n**I understand these are kind of standard with highlighting, as is shown by the markdown highlighted sample code below**. So perhaps not all of this is bugged, but only really these:\r\n- Using the tick-strings and the `${var}` replacement is not colored correctly.\r\n- Lambda `=>`'s are currently blue, they were red before\r\n- `this` and `super` are standard white, previously they were purple.\r\n\r\nSample code:\r\n```ts\r\nclass Parent {\r\n\r\n    protected alpha: {[key: string]: number} = { 'hi': 200 };\r\n\r\n    public bar(): void {\r\n        console.log('hi');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport class Class extends Parent {\r\n\r\n    constructor(private parent: Parent) { super(); }\r\n\r\n    fus = {\r\n        ro: {\r\n            da: (): void => {\r\n                console.log('*shouts*');\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public foo(): boolean {\r\n\r\n        let event = null;\r\n        event = undefined;\r\n\r\n        let a: any = { };\r\n        if(a instanceof String) console.log('instanceof string');\r\n        else if(a instanceof Parent) console.log(`instanceof ${\"parent\"}`);\r\n        var x = a.normal.keys.x.y.z.length.id.title.event.all.getAll().get().set().push().forEach().navigate().apply().sub().sup().anchor().big().normal().methods();\r\n\r\n        this.fus.ro.da();\r\n        super.bar();\r\n\r\n        return false;\r\n
