Work on a few files, like html, scss, ts\r\n2. On any file try to hit option + cmd + s or hit save all button from sidebar, it messes up my code in the current file really badly. \r\n\r\nI'm really annoyed with this bug, it gets pushed to github and causes a lot of conflicts\r\n\r\nFor eg: My file  after save looks like this \r\n```\r\n<div class=\"ng-chips-holder\" [ngClass]=\"{'ngc-disabled': isDisabled}\"><div class=\"ngc-label\" *ngIf=\"!hideLabel\"> {\r\n    {\r\n        labelText\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n</div><div class=\"ngc-flow\"><div class=\"ngc-chip\" *ngFor=\"let chip of chips; let i=index;\" [ngClass]=\"{'ngc-selected': (i === selectedChipIndex)}\"> {\r\n    {\r\n        getChipValue(chip)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n<i class=\"material-icons ngc-cross\" (click)=\"removeChip(i)\">close</i></div><input type=\"text\" [(ngModel)]=\"textBoxVal\" (keyup)=\"textTyped($event)\" (focus)=\"displaySuggestions($event)\" (blur)=\"hideSuggestions()\" placeholder=\"{{ placeholderText || 'Type Here...'}}\" [disabled]=\"isDisabled\" #inputBox/></div><ul class=\"ngc-suggestions\" [ngClass]=\"{'ngc-expanded': showSuggestions}\" [style.left]=\"suggestionsLeftOffset + 'px'\"><li *ngFor=\"let suggestion of suggestions; let idx=index;\" [ngClass]=\"{'ngc-selected': (idx === selectedSuggestionIndex)}\" (mousedown)=\"chooseSuggestion(idx, $event)\"> {\r\n    {\r\n        config ? suggestion.get(config.text): suggestion\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n</li></ul></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSame thing happens with my ts files a lot which causes errors due to this hard formatting.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24536","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24536/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24536/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24536/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24536","id":221002674,"number":24536,"title":"Pass implied type to TypeScript language service","user":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":291055694,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/typescript","name":"typescript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":286886536,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-11T16:07:11Z","updated_at":"2017-05-22T23:35:43Z","closed_at":"2017-05-22T23:35:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Test tour #23385\r\n\r\nNot necessarily something we need to do, but maybe you know how to do this:\r\n\r\n.vue files have a script part that assigns a particular type to module.exports.

Screenshot:\r\n    <img width=\"296\" alt=\"ABC Extended\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/505/24916842/a66f5e30-1edb-11e7-9db6-1dee7154c2ec.png\">\r\n3. Open VSCode\r\n4. Notice that the <kbd>\\`</kbd> and <kbd>§</kbd> keys work as intended\r\n5. Notice that the <kbd>⌃\\`</kbd> (Toggle Integrated Terminal) and <kbd>⌃⇧\\`</kbd> (Create New Integrated Terminal) keyboard shortcuts don’t work\r\n6. Open the “Keyboard Shortcuts” Settings (<kbd>⌘K ⌘S</kbd>)\r\n7. Configure “Toggle Integrated Terminal” to use the <kbd>⌃\\`</kbd> shortcut (which the page says it already uses!)\r\n8. Notice that the page now says that “Toggle Integrated Terminal” uses <kbd>⌃§</kbd>(!)\r\n9. Notice that <kbd>⌃\\`</kbd> **does** in fact run “Toggle Integrated Terminal”\r\n10. Notice that, apart from keyboard shortcuts, <kbd>\\`</kbd> and <kbd>§</kbd> still work as intended\r\n\r\nThis is very likely to be related to the keybinding changes in 1.11.
