draft for #18582\r\n\r\nFeatures in the PR:\r\n- If either `suggestion.details` or `suggestion.documentation` exist, they will appear on the side of the suggest list. If no docs but details match then label, then the docs section is not shown\r\n- To use page up and down in the docs, press `ctrl+space` and then page up and down as usual\r\n-  A logic based on cursor position and viewport length is in place to decide when to swap the list and the docs. Not fool proof yet. Just a starting point\r\n\r\nPending:\r\n- [x] More testing on corner scenarios where the list and docs need to be swapped\r\n- [x] Show docs below when editor window is too small\r\n- [ ] A visual cue for when focus is on the docs section vs the list\r\n- [ ] Test accessibility and screen reader\r\n\r\nUpdate as of 5/7: Logic to decide when to swap list and docs, where to position the suggest

Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.12 insiders\r\n- OS Version: Windows\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a text file in one split window pane\r\n2. Focus another text file in the other spilt window pane\r\n3. Run an extension command `workspace.openTextDocument` with URI from file from step 1\r\n\r\nExpected: Focus is returned to existing open file from step 1\r\n\r\nActual: A new editor instance is opened in the split window pane from step 2.  Net results is two editor windows open with same URI.  One editor in each of the split pane windows.  This is a change in the openTextDocument behavior in the insiders build.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional note:  This is impacting the mssql for VS Code extension which has a link in the query results window that refocuses to the correct lines in the SQL file.  Instead of refocusing to the existing SQL editor, now a new editor window is opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25800","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25800/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25800/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25800/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25800","id":225845977,"number":25800,"title":"Can
