Wait a minute and open the launcher menu and search for \"Code\", and you will see this generic icon without a title:\n\n![screenshot from 2016-05-23 09-07-36](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1387518/15462868/d1402bc2-20c5-11e6-8b61-1ceb343ed41b.png)\n\nThis icon is currently located at /usr/share/applications/code.desktop and it references a non-existent code.png as far as I can see.\n\nThis icon could be made much better by default. By renaming `/usr/share/applications/code.desktop` to `/usr/share/applications/vscode.desktop` the icon title appears in the launcher (I'm not sure why). The icon appears by changing the icon entry to `Icon=/usr/share/code/resources/app/resources/linux/code.png` for both occurences in the file.\n\nI haven't opened this as a pull request, as I am not sure how it affects the .deb installation process.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6648","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6648/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6648/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6648/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6648","id":156216635,"number":6648,"title":"test new `vscode.diff` command","user":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/17","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/17","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/17/labels","id":1716950,"number":17,"title":"May 2016","description":"","creator":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":302,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-04-19T13:15:12Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T08:29:02Z","due_on":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-05-31T08:25:06Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-05-23T07:33:41Z","updated_at":"2016-05-24T09:21:08Z","closed_at":"2016-05-24T09:21:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"- [x] any os - **@bpasero**\n#1865\n\nThere is a new command to compare two resources: `vscode.diff`.
