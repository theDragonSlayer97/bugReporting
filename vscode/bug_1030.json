VSCode Version: 0.10.11\n- OS Version: Windows 7 Pro\n\nWhat I Would Expect:\n\nI would love it  if my files did not close, or if I got a warning that something bad happened before my files close.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nPreface: It happens in all sorts of circumstances, but this is the fastest way I have seen to reproduce it. It does involve installing a plugin, but this happens to me (and other members of my team) when we do not have any plugins running. It just happens less often, and we do not yet have an easy way to reproduce it beyond these steps.\n1. Install the tslint plugin\n2. Set `\"tslint.configFile\"` at the project level to reference a `tslint.json` within the project (mine is at the root of the project)\n3. Open split view, one side being `tslint.json`, the other being some TypeScript in the same project.\n4. Try changing and saving the rules, and going back to the code to see the linting rules affect the code.Do this multiple times, I move rather quickly between panes and edits.\n5. Eventually, both sides of the split pane will close. Its worth noting that despite working with both files, `tslint.json` does not show up in the \"Working Files\" list, but the code file does.\n\nThere was a bug, #4542, where this was reported via files mounted over GVFS, but since it seems to be happening on Windows with local git repos, it may be more a more general issue, Here are some timestamped logs from when it happened last,
