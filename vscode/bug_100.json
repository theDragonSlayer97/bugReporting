It would be nice to have visual indication of root folder for currently visible open file. \r\n\r\noptions:\r\n* Different color for tabs from same root. tabs may mix on tab bar\r\n* tab groping for same root folder on tab bar - with color indication, like in internet explorer\r\n* it would also be helpful to change the root in the \"Open Editors\" section, when you switch files from different group it changes text with  active root like \"OPEN EDITORS - root folder 1\" or \"OPEN EDITORS - full path of root\". reversing path (folder/paretnfolder/c: instead of c:\\parentfolder\\folder\") may be helpful to correctly identify the actual root in case we have same name of folder from different folder hierarchy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32829","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32829/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32829/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32829/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32829","id":251433309,"number":32829,"title":"Code helper spawning \"find processes\" and making the OS unresponsive","user":{"login":"MihkelBaranov","id":3790782,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3790782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MihkelBaranov","html_url":"https://github.com/MihkelBaranov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MihkelBaranov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MihkelBaranov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MihkelBaranov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MihkelBaranov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MihkelBaranov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MihkelBaranov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MihkelBaranov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MihkelBaranov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MihkelBaranov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":301186618,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/search","name":"search","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2017-08-19T15:53:54Z","updated_at":"2017-09-26T16:34:51Z","closed_at":"2017-09-25T20:49:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

Install the new one, 64 bit version of Visual Studio Code.\r\n2. Try install any extension via CLI:\r\n      * `$ code --install-extension ms-vscode.csharp`\r\n3. Wait for the _Heat death of the universe_ with messages in console:\r\n```\r\nFound 'ms-vscode.csharp' in the marketplace.\r\nInstalling...\r\n(node:6584) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection (rejection id: 1): TypeError: this._state.then is not a function\r\n(node:6584) DeprecationWarning: Unhandled promise rejections are deprecated. In the future, promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the Node.js process with a non-zero exit code.\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. It is possible that it will finish eventually, but I was waiting about 30 minutes (for the first time), and then I had pressed `Ctrl + C`. When I was checking all extensions which I would like to use, I was waiting less then one minute for each one, but in both cases Process Explorer shows 0% of CPU usage for VS Code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhy I would like to install extensions from console? Well I have got PowerShell script which will install all of from my list, and then synchronizes configuration with OneDrive and Git repo via Hard Links (see: [GitHub](https://github.com/DominikJaniec/EnvConfigs/blob/6069a7aa53c5e950734a9645285c0927d397563a/vscode/_prepare.ps1#L37)). This script was working for previous version of VS Code which was 32 bit. Finally extensions were installed via _Extension Manager's tab_. Here is a list of extensions which I had checked:\r\n  * donjayamanne.githistory\r\n  * hoovercj.haskell-linter\r\n  * Ionide.Ionide-fsharp\r\n  * ms-vscode.csharp\r\n  * ms-vscode.PowerShell\r\n  *

I have an existing codebase that I am converting over piecemeal to use 4 space indents.  Trouble is, the codebase is already full of a mixture of spaces and tabs which assumes that a tab character indents by 8 spaces, despite nominally having an indent of four spaces.

now that my version is pretty old, so maybe this is already fixed, but I'm reporting it anyway because I didn't find a matching issue (it's not #31782 because the assertion is different).\r\n\r\n\r\nI got this error waiting for me today after resuming Windows from hibernation.

I did manage to get a stack trace from Process Hacker before, though - but it's not too informative due to missing symbols, I think:\r\n\r\n```0, ntoskrnl.exe!KiDeliverApc+0x13d\r\n1,
