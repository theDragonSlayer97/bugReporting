In this situation the file is blank in all 3 editors.\n- In Sublime text, write \"Hello\".

You can type the path to a file, but you have to include the full folder names and slashes. E.g.: `app/webroot/main.css`, or `webroot/main.css`.\n\n[Brackets](http://brackets.io), another code editor, has much more lenient matching. You could find that file by typing `appwebmain`, or even just `apwemain` or `awm`. Any sequence of characters that appear in the file's path will work. Something short like `awm` could match multiple files, but it's good at determining which one you meant (based on special characters and capitalization in the path and filename).\n\nYou can read about the algorithm [here](http://blog.brackets.io/2013/04/03/brackets-quick-open-thats-no-regex/). The file that does the work is [StringMatch.js](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/2c1616a6346dfee29a8321b5ecc9e0f636ec42d8/src/utils/StringMatch.js).

So in my opinion some improvement in ui customization would be welcomed by a lot of us. In the ideal word every pixel and element of VS Code should be customizable with extensions, but for start it would be enough to start with the following things:\n- customization of the side panel (#427 and #123)\n- adding support for custom tabs, the possibilities of the quick box is very limited (#710)\n- adding the ability to add and remove ui elements (e.g. a bottom panel for error listing like in Atom)\n\nI have read about the [approach](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/our-approach) followed by VS Code. So instead of allowing extensions to create custom ui elements, VS Code itself should provide some API for this, what allows to the developers to set the content, but the styling of the content should be based on the theme of VS Code.\n\nSo in a nutshell: VS Code core provide the bones and template of the ui elements, extension developers can set the content but not the style and theme developers can style the content. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1833/reactions","total_count":305,"+1":252,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":52}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1832","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1832/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1832/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1832/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1832","id":125202622,"number":1832,"title":"Debug hover complex inspection","user":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/3/labels","id":1354261,"number":3,"title":"Jan 2016","description":"","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":361,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-10-13T23:36:50Z","updated_at":"2016-10-28T08:23:24Z","due_on":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-02-01T08:53:58Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-01-06T15:49:53Z","updated_at":"2016-01-28T06:20:32Z","closed_at":"2016-01-28T06:20:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- [x] win @dbaeumer \n- [x] mac @bpasero\n- [x] linux @aeschli \n\nWe have improved the **debug hover** when inspecting complex variables.

are back from the holidays and are rolling again. We are starting to target our next important milestone for Code, the [Build 2016 conference](http://build.microsoft.com/), which takes place at end of March in San Francisco. The [roadmap](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Roadmap) outlines our high level plans for getting there and this is our detailed plan for the January 2016 iteration. \n\nWe plan to declare General Availability (\"GA\") with the March 2016 release. GA comes with several quality obligations in areas such as accessibility and localization. We know that we have significant gaps here and we want to start to tackle them right away. On the drive to Connect(); we accumulated engineering debt that we must to address sooner rather than later. And, as we always do, we will continue to ship monthly and address key development pain points and adoption blockers.  \n\nBased on these imperatives we arrived at the following themes for January:\n- Ramp up the work to get to GA (accessibility, localization, ...).\n- Reduce the engineering debt.\n- Respond to feedback and try to address as many issues as possible.\n\nThe [January Test Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Atestplan-item+milestone%3A%22Jan+2016%22) is in progress.\n### Schedule\n\nThe goal is to make the January update available by the following dates.\n\nEnd game dates (we end an iteration with an [endgame](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Development-Process#end-game))\n- Monday Jan 25th evening (GMT+1): freeze\n- Tuesday: test day\n- Wednesday: fix day\n- Thursday: fix day\n- Friday: Done: documentation, release notes update, bugs verified\n\n:warning: update we will switch to `dev channels` and deprecate the `insider channel`. We will make the new dev channels available as soon as possible during the end game and will hold back updating the stable channel until we have received early feedback.\n### Plan Items\n\n:runner: =
