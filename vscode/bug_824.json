VSCode Version: 1.4\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nCompleting a snippet, where the `$1` token occurs more than once and where the first instance of the token is preceded by a character that triggers autocompletion in the editor, causes subsequent completions of the `$1` token to overwrite the preceding character with the preceding characters from the autocompletion.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/298883/18032075/edcc1a8e-6d3d-11e6-8205-79859bf17360.png)\n\n![vscode-snippet-completion-bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/298883/18032063/7f365300-6d3d-11e6-9e03-228ccff321cc.gif)\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Use the following snippet (or any snippet containing two or more instances of the `$1` token where the first token is preceded by an underscore:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"prefix\": \"t1\",\n    \"body\": [\n        \"this._$1 = void 0;\",\n        \"this.get('$1');\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n1. Create a new file with the same language as the snippet. Enter the following into the editor:\n\n``` js\nthis._foo = 1;\n```\n1. Use the snippet by typing `t1` into the editor on a subsequent line and pressing tab\n2. Type `_foo` for the snippet completion and then press TAB to complete the snippet (which will also unwittingly trigger autocompletion)\n3. The apostrophe preceding the second token is overwritten using the underscore from the autocompletion selection\n\n**Workaround**\n\nPressing escape to cancel autocompletion before pressing tab to complete the snippet will stop autocompletion from ruining the snippet result.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11060/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11059","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11059/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11059/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11059/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11059","id":173631836,"number":11059,"title":"The C/Cpp Language Server server crashed 5 times in the last 3 minutes.

VSCode Version: 1.5.0-insider (had this issue in older builds as well)\n- OS Version: Windows 10 64bit (Anniversary Update)\n\n**I tried with different color themes as well. Same issue.**\n\nFirst of all, I know that having such long php files is not a good thing. BUT the syntax highlighting breaks in my php file after a certain section (which has a lot of quotation marks and apostrophes).\n\nMy file is 389 lines but it breaks at line 303. I don't want to copy-paste the whole code, but I can copy the section which seems to break my syntax highlighting.\n\n``` php\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\" style=\"padding-right: 5px\">\n        <input name=\"value<?=($plan['col'])?>[]\" value=\"<?=$data[$plan['col']]['value']?>\" type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\" style=\"padding-left: 0px\">\n        <select name=\"unit<?=($plan['col'])?>[]\" class=\"form-control\">\n            <option value=\"-1\"<?=($data[$plan['col']]['unit'] == -1 ? ' selected' : '')?>>-</option>\n            <option value=\"1\"<?=($data[$plan['col']]['unit'] == 1 ? ' selected' : '')?>>Ft</option>\n            <option value=\"2\"<?=($data[$plan['col']]['unit'] == 2 ?

' selected' : '')?>>db</option>\n        </select>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nCopying this section in itself doesn't break syntax highlighting, but if I take this part out, the syntax starts working again. I tried to add extra code to stretch the file out to 390+ lines again after taking out this part of the code and it still worked. I didn't find any issues like this (tried with and without extensions as well).\n\nHere is where it breaks:\n![issue1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6963476/18030617/e2b03152-6cbc-11e6-82a3-24453ced78ad.jpg)\n\nI take out the \"bad\"

I am not talking about something like the Task runner which is already part of vscode, but of extensions like these:\n- [vscode-filtertext](https://github.com/yhirose/vscode-filtertext)\n- [vscode-shell](https://github.com/bbenoist/vscode-shell)\n- [LaunchTerminal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=testingtestingtesting.launchterminal)\n- [OpenVim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mattn.OpenVim)\n- [Run on Save](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emeraldwalk.RunOnSave)\n- ...\n\nMy proposal is to add these features to the vscode so people don't have to rely on extensions for these things. I am thinking about a _more generic version_ which lets you:\n- Execute a custom commands\n- Execute a custom commands in the integrated terminal\n- Pre-configure commands in the user's config\n- Bind custom keyboard shortcuts to (pre-configured) commands\n- Have variables available which get replaced with things like the current filepath, filename, working directory, line number, preferred line length (for [`par`](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/formatting-text-with-par/))\n- Pass selected text to command\n- Filter selected text with command (like `sort -r`)\n- Read in output of a command\n\nMaybe even:\n- Attach triggers like _onSave_ to a command\n\nLet me know what you think about integrating this directly into vscode. Keep in mind that vi's `:!` covers  a lot of these cases and has been a feature right from the start.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11044","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11044/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11044/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11044/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11044","id":173584331,"number":11044,"title":"Task builder icon keeps turning","user":{"login":"FLWrd","id":16035872,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/16035872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FLWrd","html_url":"https://github.com/FLWrd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FLWrd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FLWrd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FLWrd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FLWrd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FLWrd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FLWrd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FLWrd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FLWrd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FLWrd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-08-27T07:51:21Z","updated_at":"2017-07-13T22:32:04Z","closed_at":"2017-07-13T22:32:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: 10.11.6\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
