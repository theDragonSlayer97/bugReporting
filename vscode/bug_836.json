Searching for an extension (i.e. using PowerShell as a keyword or anything else) doesn't return any results. Additionally, if I press the \"Update\" button for either of the existing extensions, an error message saying **unable to get local issuer certificate** pop up. I suspect that it is caused by the fact that the certificate that's used by the proxy to re-encrypt the traffic is not trusted by the crypto (OpenSSL?) that's being used by VSCode. If that's the case, there seem to be few ways to resolve it:\n1. Add the URL that VSCode uses to download extensions from to the exclusion list on the proxy to avoid re-encryption. I couldn't find that URL in the documentation. Any idea where this can be obtained? Would be nice if that error message would include the URL as well.\n2. Provide a mechanism that would allow adding self-signed (based on an approval) certificates to the trust store relied by VSCode. \n\nHere's the version details:\n- Version 1.4.0\n- Commit

@waderyan @joaomoreno @seanmcbreen \n\nWith the direct application URL handler changes coming in this next iteration we're working on changes to the Marketplace UX to allow direct installation of extension from Marketplace. We wanted to run a few options by you to get your thoughts as well, as there are a few factors to consider:\n- The VS Code insiders build has a separate application handler so needs to be handled separately\n- Older versions of the client won’t support the application handler hence copy command option still needs to be present\n\nFollowing are two options we're considering:\nOption 1:\n![vscode install1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13758921/17803615/27e0aa08-6615-11e6-84c1-e26071499693.png)\nOption 2:\n![vs code install2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13758921/17803619/2e683738-6615-11e6-9f92-dc961f2368c2.png)\n\nCurrent preference is toward option 1, the reasoning being:\n- A majority of the

On Linux (or possibly on OS X), open two separate terminal windows.\n2. In both windows, run `cd` with no arguments so you're in your home directory.\n3. In the first terminal, run:\n   - `mkdir foo`\n   - `cd foo`\n   - `echo \"Hello\" > file.txt`\n4. In the second terminal, run:\n   - `mkdir bar`\n   - `cd bar`\n   - `code ~/foo/file.txt`\n5. VS Code starts up fine, and loads `~/foo/file.txt` without problems.\n6. Exit VS Code.\n7. In the first terminal, run `rmdir ~/bar`. This will succeed on Linux, because processes don't lock their current working directory while running. So having a terminal window open, `cd`'ed into `~/bar`, does not lock `~/bar` and it can therefore be removed by other terminals.\n8. Now in the second terminal, run `code ~/foo/file.txt` again. VS Code will fail with the following error:\n\n``` plain\nshell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory\nsh: 0: getcwd() failed: No such file or directory\npath.js:1184\n          cwd = process.cwd();\n                        ^\n\nError: ENOENT: no such file or directory, uv_cwd\n    at Error (native)\n    at Object.resolve (path.js:1184:25)\n    at Function.Module._resolveLookupPaths (module.js:263:17)\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:330:31)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:290:25)\n    at Module.require (module.js:367:17)\n    at require (internal/module.js:16:19)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/usr/share/code/resources/app/out/cli.js:5:1)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:413:34)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:422:10)\n```\n## Notes\n\nI believe this could also be reproduced on OS X, because I think the OS X file system works similarly to Linux, but I don't have access to a Mac to test it. I was able to verify that this does NOT occur on Windows, because on Windows you can't remove a directory while any Command Prompt windows are open in that directory, and so this bug reproduction fails on step 7 on a Windows machine.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10688","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10688/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10688/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10688/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10688","id":172060865,"number":10688,"title":"Select all when sidebar is clicked, selects line numbers","user":{"login":"swarajgiri","id":6647345,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6647345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swarajgiri","html_url":"https://github.com/swarajgiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swarajgiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swarajgiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swarajgiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swarajgiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swarajgiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swarajgiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swarajgiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swarajgiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swarajgiri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":400270121,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/verification-needed","name":"verification-needed","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":291057332,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/verified","name":"verified","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/23/labels","id":1854621,"number":23,"title":"August 2016","description":"","creator":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":515,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-06-29T08:56:21Z","updated_at":"2017-06-14T16:41:47Z","due_on":"2016-09-02T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-09-27T14:17:34Z"},"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-08-19T06:03:54Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T06:26:12Z","closed_at":"2016-08-19T06:15:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version:   Ubuntu 16.04.1\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

The file is still there in the explorer, but its settings are ignored.\n\nFor example, it will give me this error on my AppComponent class (which has a Component decorator)...\n\n```\n[ts] \nExperimental support for decorators is a feature that is subject to change in a future release. Set the 'experimentalDecorators' option to remove this warning.\nclass AppComponent\n```\n\nAnd also, in my pollyfills.ts file, I'm doing a require('zone.js/dist/zone.js'); and I get the following error:\n\n```\n[ts] \nCannot find name 'require'.\nany\n```\n\nBut, as you can see, my tsconfig.json is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"es5\",\n        \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n        \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n        \"sourceMap\": false,\n        \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\n        \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n

follows:\n\n```\nroot/\nroot/package.json\nroot/tsconfig.json\nroot/typings.json\nroot/webpack.config.js\nroot/app/polyfills.ts\nroot/app/main.ts\nroot/app/app.component.ts\nroot/app/index.html\n```\n\nI'm not sure if it's at all related to the fact that I have awesomeTypescriptLoaderOptions following compilerOptions, and VSCode is getting confused?\n\nI have found that sometimes if I modify or remove and re-add the tsconfig.json file, VSCode will then pick everything up correctly - but then at some point later (in this case it was about 15 minutes, no restarts of the app) it will decide to drop everything again...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10682","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10682/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10682/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10682/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10682","id":172023636,"number":10682,"title":"Test
