VSCode Version: 1.11\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.10 4.10 Generic Kernel.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a file on a directory with unicode name-more specifically \"foreign languages.\"\r\n2. Try to debug it by setting breakpoints.\r\n\r\nThis might be the reason for the problem that I have described in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/617.\r\n\r\nI was able to debug C++ file without any problems when I am debugging a C++ file on a \"regular\" directory (e.g. /media/username/**DriveName**/username/Documents/Visual Studio 2124/Projects/ProblemName/ProjectName/Bar.cpp).\r\n\r\nWhen the C++ source file is on a directory with any \"foreign language\" characters, Code says it cannot find the file and shows a strange file location (e.g. /media/username/**354203210 353263274353245250**/username/Documents/Visual Studio 2017/Projects/SolutionName/ProjectName/Foo.cpp).\r\n\r\nThe issue can be reproduced if you try to debug a C++ file with unicode on a regular folder; the file doesn't have to be on a different drive.\r\n\r\nCode can read files with unicode directory name, but Code can't just debug the files since Code couldn't find it.\r\n\r\nOther info:\r\nThe drive's name (354203210 353263274353245250 in this case) is written in my first language.\r\nThe file system of the drive is NTFS.\r\nThe C++ files that I had problems with are symbolic links to the C++ files on the NTFS drive.\r\nThe drive's name 354203210 353263274353245250 should be \"새 볼륨\" without quotation marks just in case if you need it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24341","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24341/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24341/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24341/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24341","id":220441284,"number":24341,"title":"[Feature

Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\nHello\r\n\r\nWhen opening a file from the command line with `code --wait --reuse-window <file>`, the command waits for the previously opened window to be closed before exiting. It is coherent with the use of `--wait` without `--reuse-window` but it is not very convenient.\r\n\r\nOne can want to reuse an existing window because it is faster than opening a new window. The small delay before the file has finished opened can be a little annoying when writing a commit message for example (if you don't use git or the upcoming SCM API).\r\n\r\nOne can also argue that it is easier to only close a tab than close the whole window : <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd> instead of  <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd>  <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd> or  <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd> on mac for example\r\n\r\nOr maybe there could be a new command-line toggle instead of modifying the behaviour of `--wait`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24327/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24326","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24326/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24326/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24326/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24326","id":220417418,"number":24326,"title":"virtualenvironment not respected","user":{"login":"tyclintw","id":19498033,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19498033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyclintw","html_url":"https://github.com/tyclintw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyclintw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyclintw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyclintw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyclintw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyclintw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyclintw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyclintw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyclintw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyclintw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-08T18:17:58Z","updated_at":"2017-04-08T18:30:46Z","closed_at":"2017-04-08T18:30:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.11.1 (d9484d12b38879b7f4cdd1150efeb2fd2c1fbf39, 2017-04-06T14:00:34.044Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.5.0\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|vscode-docker|PeterJausovec|0.0.13|\r\n|python|donjayamanne|0.6.0|\r\n|vim|vscodevim|0.6.13|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nSystem:\r\nMac OS X\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
