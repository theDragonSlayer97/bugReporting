This is really a annoyance in my current project where most tests and files are under the same folder and the __tests__ dir is hidden by ellipsis\r\n* /DetailsPage/index.js\r\n* /DetailsPage/__tests__/index.js\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a workspace that has deeply nested paths\r\n2. type `cmd+p` and start typing a file name\r\n3. *err* When the path is longer than the quick-open window ellipsis are added to the right of the path.\r\n\r\n## PR Feedback\r\nI saw where in the code to correct the quick-open css. It also looks like the line-height for the items in the quick-open widget are set by JS to either 44px or 22px. But 44px is only triggered if the type implements getDescription(). I was going to add a getHeight method that the FileType could use to return 44px. And then use css to bump the path down to the next line.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this would actually be merged if I submitted the PR 📟 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18258","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18258/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18258/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18258/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18258","id":199375677,"number":18258,"title":"Please add an ability to highlight any extra characters belonging to a word/variable","user":{"login":"ArthurZ","id":701808,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/701808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ","html_url":"https://github.com/ArthurZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArthurZ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-01-07T18:08:51Z","updated_at":"2017-01-09T08:50:12Z","closed_at":"2017-01-09T08:50:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Please add an ability to highlight (with an intent to copy) any extra characters belonging to a word on double click.\r\n\r\nExample is say symbols in Ruby -

VSCode Version:1.8.1\r\n- OS Version:Windows 10 x64 and Kali Linux x64\r\n\r\nHey I am trying to make VSCode extension that uses nodehun module \r\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/nodehun \r\nwhich dynamically links hunspell library using node-gyp \r\nI have on windows 10: \r\n\r\nprocess.version = 7.4.0 \r\nprocess.arch = x64\r\n\r\nIf I try to use nodehun methods manually using NodeJS command line interface everything works fine but if I try to use it in extension.js and debug via Visual Code I have:\r\n\r\nprocess.version = 6.5.0\r\nprocess.arch = ia32\r\n\r\nThat makes me encounter with error\r\n\r\nError: %1 is not a valid win32 application. \r\n\r\nI don't really understand how can VSCode use NodeJS version which I don't have installed.\r\nSimilarly on Kali linux x64 I have:\r\n\r\nprocess.version = 7.4.0\r\nprocess.arch = x64\r\n\r\nand debugging extension via VSCode\r\n\r\nprocess.version = 6.5.0\r\nprocess.arch = x64\r\n\r\nwhich at least have the same arch so I encounter with error\r\n\r\nError: Module version mismatch. Expected 50, got 51\r\n\r\nthis is really interesting because there is no node_module_version = 50, as you can see here on the nodejs website:\r\n\r\nhttps://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/\r\nthere is only node_module_version 48 for versions 6.x.x and 51 for versions 7.x.x.\r\n\r\nSo I tried to rebuild with on windows 10 x64 \r\nnpm rebuild --target=6.5.0 --arch=ia32 and then debug via VSCode with error\r\n\r\nError: A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed. \r\n\r\nAnd on Kali linux x64\r\nnpm rebuild --target=6.5.0 and then debug\r\n\r\nError: Module version mismatch. Expected 50, got 48\r\n\r\n\r\nI think there might be a trick in debug settings. My launch.json looks like this:\r\n\r\n// A launch configuration that launches the extension inside a new window\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n    \"configurations\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": \"Launch Extension\",\r\n            \"type\": \"extensionHost\",\r\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n            \"runtimeExecutable\": \"${execPath}\",\r\n            \"args\": [\"--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceRoot}\" ],\r\n            \"stopOnEntry\": false\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": \"Launch Tests\",\r\n            \"type\": \"extensionHost\",\r\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n            \"runtimeExecutable\": \"${execPath}\",\r\n            \"args\": [\"--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceRoot}\", \"--extensionTestsPath=${workspaceRoot}/test\" ],\r\n            \"stopOnEntry\": false\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHow is it possible that VSCode debugger have different NodeJS version that I have installed and using node_module_version = 50?\r\nAny suggestions or workaround how could I make it work?
