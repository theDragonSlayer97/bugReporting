have a VSCode extension for [Cake](http://cakebuild.net/) which extends VSCode with a few things, including snippets, commands, syntax highlighting etc.\n\nWe recently converted Cake to be built with

However, in order for this to work, we have to switch the configured language for the file, i.e. we have to change this:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1271146/18263632/8300bad0-7403-11e6-83d0-6c234cf8bbe6.png)\n\nTo this:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1271146/18263650/a1d36890-7403-11e6-9e85-983167e937b7.png)\n\nvia the dropdown list:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1271146/18263641/94c8638a-7403-11e6-81ea-0931bda8d77c.png)\n\nHowever, in doing that, we then lose the configured snippets that we have configured.
