To do so make sure the following ESLint rule is enabled in the `.eslintrc.json`: `\"no-extra-semi\": \"warn\"`. Add extra semicolons and make sure that the light bulb appears. Execute actions from the light bulb.\r\n- enable auto fix on save using the following workspace setting `\"eslint.autoFixOnSave\": true` (note as with format on save this is only available if ` \"files.autoSave\"` is off or on focus lost.). Ensure that fixes are applied on save and that the fixes are applied at the correct positions.\r\n\r\n \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16496","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16496/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16496/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16496/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16496","id":193472878,"number":16496,"title":"Command not found integrated terminal of Ubuntu","user":{"login":"AbuAbdellah","id":22857205,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/22857205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbuAbdellah","html_url":"https://github.com/AbuAbdellah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbuAbdellah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbuAbdellah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbuAbdellah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbuAbdellah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbuAbdellah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbuAbdellah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbuAbdellah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbuAbdellah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbuAbdellah/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-12-05T11:28:31Z","updated_at":"2017-05-07T08:26:15Z","closed_at":"2016-12-06T10:00:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Version 1.7.2\r\nCommit 7ba55c5860b152d999dda59393ca3ebeb1b5c85f\r\nDate 2016-11-21T22:14:18.217Z\r\nShell 1.3.8\r\nRenderer 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode 6.5.0\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

VSCode Version: 1.7.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nI've just been updating my extension to make it so that automatic edits, made by the extension in between any two manual edits made by the user, are not included in the user's undo history and are simply removed as a batch as the user steps through the undo history made by their manual edits, so that the minor edits made by the extension are not given the same weight as a user's normal edits. Unfortunately, the `undoStopBefore` and `undoStopAfter` options seem to have no effect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the simple extension _autotrim_ from https://github.com/axefrog/vscode-autotrim\r\n2. Modify [line 36 of extension.ts](https://github.com/axefrog/vscode-autotrim/blob/master/src/extension.ts#L36), disabling undo stops so that the code matches the code block further below.\r\n3. Set up a text file with five lines of text, and some trailing spaces on lines 2, 3 and 4.\r\n4. Test the extension in debug mode by making a change to line 1 and then using the arrow keys to move the cursor to line 5 and make another edit there. The extension will trim lines 2, 3 and 4 as it moves past them on the way to line 5.\r\n5. Try and undo the edits to lines 5 and 1.\r\n\r\n**Bug:** I'd expect the first undo to remove the edit to line 5, and the next undo to reverse all of the automatic changes to lines 2, 3, and 4, as well as the manual edit made to line 1. Instead, undo stops are also created for each line that was automatically trimmed by the extension, requiring several additional undos before the manual edit to line 1 is undone.\r\n\r\nThe code for line 36 should be:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\neditor.edit(ed => ed.replace(line.range, text), {undoStopBefore: false, undoStopAfter: false});\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4719","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"DF8A:24888:4A41AB6:6103DD1:59D93EAE","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=644>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=642>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"10a1f8bd2f1abf69b5c48902faef10b9\"","status":"200 OK"}}
