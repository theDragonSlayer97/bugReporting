overall startup sequence from starting the main process to starting the renderer process is waterfall'ish, esp. since we don't just wait for the app to be ready but because we do many things before starting the renderer (which itself doesn't do anything else than loading code for the first 1 second). Let's identify what can run after or in parallel to getting the renderer ready. Also, I have created a benchmark, stripped down, electron app, which should set the baseline - we can't get faster but should strive to become as close as possible. \r\n\r\nThe timings for a simple app (attached) are \r\n\r\n```\r\napp,started: (absolute) 0ms, (relative) 0\r\napp,ready: (absolute) 58ms, (relative) 58\r\nmainWindow,created: (absolute) 90ms, (relative) 32\r\nrenderer,html: (absolute) 378ms, (relative) 288\r\n```\r\n\r\nVS Code (on my mac) takes ~750ms before loading the main window (compare to `mainWindow,created`) and ~1200ms before loading the big chunk of code (workbench.min.js, compare with `renderer,html`). That makes roughly 600ms that are spending somewhere. Since that is roughly the time it takes to load the main portion of our code, I wonder if those 600ms initialisation work can run in parallel, while we load the code of the workbench.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17108/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17107","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17107/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17107/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17107/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/17107","id":195209968,"number":17107,"title":"Update
