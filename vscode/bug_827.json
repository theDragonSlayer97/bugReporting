7\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open Code to a folder with lots of folders and files\n2. Open 2 explorer windows and place them in front of Code leaving the tree view visible between them\n3. Click and drag a folder between the 2 explorer windows and over the tree view.\n4. Drag back and fourth fairly quickly watching Code gray out and return to normal.\n5. Watch for it to not restore back to normal.\n6. Bring Code into focus.\n7. See that you cannot interact with the Code editor window.\n8. The File Menu bar does continue to work.\n9. Drag a file or folder back over Code to restore functionality.\n\nSometimes it will reproduce very nicely and other times hardly at all. I think the folder/file structure in the tree view makes a difference. I can only do this with folders and not files and the motion has to be fairly fast. As if it misses the mouse leaving the window event or something like that.\n\n[OK]\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10969","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10969/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10969/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10969/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/10969","id":173267305,"number":10969,"title":"Fixes

Editing a file `y.txt` inside a directory `x`\n- I want to create a new file `z.txt` in directory `x`\n- I am a user who likes to be efficient and loves keyboard shortcuts\n\n**Workflows to create new files:**\n1. Take over control of the mouse/trackpad, navigate to +file icon (top left next to explorer). A new file is created inside `x` and I can name it `z.txt`, then edit its contents.\n2. Press `cmd+n`, which opens a new file. Now I want to save it so I press `cmd+s` and proceed to name the file, navigate to `x` directory and save. I can edit the contents before and after saving\n\n**Problems with current workflows:**\n- Method 1 of creating a new file is good, but I need to take control of the mouse/trackpad. \n- Method 2 can be done keyboard-only but is less efficient than method 1 as it requires thinking about where `x` directory is and how to find it.\n\n**Improvement proposal:**\n\nI am proposing the ideal workflow with the given scenario.\n1. Edit the file `y.txt`, which is in `x`\n2. Press `cmd+n`, editor opens new file\n3. I type the file name inside the new editor tab (as file content)\n4. Press `cmd+s` to save file, the editor takes the first line of the content as file name and saves it into `x`b y default\n5. The first line either stays as it is or is deleted and I can go on writing the new file\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10967/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10966","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10966/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10966/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10966/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10966","id":173259773,"number":10966,"title":"VS Code hangs when i launch Powershell debug with f5","user":{"login":"maxcli","id":15278914,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/15278914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxcli","html_url":"https://github.com/maxcli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxcli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxcli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxcli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxcli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxcli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxcli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxcli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxcli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxcli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-25T17:11:39Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T14:58:30Z","closed_at":"2016-08-26T14:58:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"VSCode Version: 0.7.0.

annoying conflict with the \"Alt\" button when im on full screen, you see Alt is the button used for multi-selection and also for toggling the menu bar, means the menu bar keeps appearing every time i try to multi-select, which causes the code to scroll down a line or two in a very annoying way\n\nI guess a good solution would be giving us the option to assign another button for toggling the menu bar instead of Alt.\n\nthank

This is also the case on my Windows 7 laptop, where I did a clean install of VSCode + the extension (same versions) for testing:\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/4o0njo8.png)\n\nWhat makes this especially annoying is that when I hide the Output panel, it pops back up automatically when a new error appears and _steals focus_.\n\nI have tried the following steps to solve the issue on my Win10 PC (to no avail):\n- reinstall VSCode\n- remove all extensions except vshaxe\n- delete `%AppData%/Code`\n- start VSCode from the command line with `code --user-data-dir=<some-random-directory>`\n\nThe only reasonable explanation I have is that _something_ must be different about my VSCode installation, maybe some leftover configuration from earlier VSCode versions or _anything_ that would make it behave differently in this regard.

This facilitates quickly re-arranging elements within a document without visually hunting for the beginning/ending tags of an element.  \n\nThank you for this great editor and providing it as free & open source!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10952","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10952/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10952/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10952/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10952","id":173192498,"number":10952,"title":"Auto show/hide terminal window [Feature Req]","user":{"login":"cDecker32","id":1641708,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1641708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cDecker32","html_url":"https://github.com/cDecker32","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cDecker32/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cDecker32/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cDecker32/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cDecker32/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cDecker32/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cDecker32/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cDecker32/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cDecker32/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cDecker32/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-08-25T12:41:29Z","updated_at":"2017-08-17T23:42:12Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Similar to behavior in Visual Studio, is there a way we could get the terminal to show/hide automatically?

VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: MacOSX\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nProblem 1: VSCode gets into a very tight loop saving an open file.\nIt seems, if you save a file from VSCode and then make a modification to the same file from the shell, while the file is open in VSCode, it causes VSCode to go into a loop - saving the file continuously. \n1. Open a file in VSCode (e.g. package.json )\n2. Remove a package from dependencies.\n3. Save the file. \n4. Very quickly after (i tried 1-2 seconds after), 'npm install the_same_pkg -S' \n\nIt causes the package.json tab in VSCode to go into a loop, toggling between the modified \"circle\" and close \"x\" in very quick succession.\n\nThe only way to recover seems to be to close the tab - at which point VSCode complains that \nthere are unsaved changes. I've tried saving and not saving and not saving the perceived changes\nfrom VScodes point-of-view. In either case, the npm modifications to package.json are lost. \n\nKilling the tab post modification-save from VSCode and then opening the file in a new tab does not seem to cause the same issue. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10950","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10950/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10950/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10950/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10950","id":173187405,"number":10950,"title":"No syntax highlight at some points in js files","user":{"login":"Orodan","id":7422824,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7422824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Orodan","html_url":"https://github.com/Orodan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Orodan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Orodan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Orodan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Orodan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Orodan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Orodan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Orodan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Orodan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Orodan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-08-25T12:16:23Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T16:25:26Z","closed_at":"2016-08-25T16:25:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: OS X Yosemite 10.10.5\n\nHi,\n\nusing VSCode to write some javascript, sometimes it ends up with no syntax highlight at some points in the file.\n\nHere is an example of what I'm talking about :\n\n<img width=\"842\" alt=\"capture d ecran 2016-08-25 a 14 15 05\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7422824/17968669/5c307636-6ace-11e6-8c4e-a013b64f1570.png\">\n\nThe code is correctly formated and functional, and it actually have a correct highlight on other editors like atom for example).
