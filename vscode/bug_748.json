technically doesn't have an escape code for LF, since it just uses the 0x0A character. The regex `\\xA` is incorrect (it should be `\\x0A`) and is being treated as the two-character sequence `\"xA\"`. But then once we've fixed that, replacing 0x0A with \\n in `removeAnsiEscapeCodes` is a no-op. Better to just remove the `str.replace(LF, '\\n')` call.\n\nFixes #12608.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13344","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13344/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13344/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13344/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13344","id":181649467,"number":13344,"title":"want to disable auto format feature of editor","user":{"login":"jojokaran72","id":13706072,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13706072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojokaran72","html_url":"https://github.com/jojokaran72","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojokaran72/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojokaran72/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojokaran72/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojokaran72/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojokaran72/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojokaran72/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojokaran72/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojokaran72/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jojokaran72/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-07T11:49:21Z","updated_at":"2016-10-07T18:07:31Z","closed_at":"2016-10-07T18:07:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.5.3 (5be4091987a98e3870d89d630eb87be6d9bafd27, 2016-09-22T08:50:42.185Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 6.1.7601\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

VSCode Version: 1.6.0-insider\n- OS Version:\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. install vscode-jsonrpc@^3.0.0-alpha.1\n2. install @type/node\n3. create tsconfig.json\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n        \"sourceMap\": true\n    }\n}\n```\n1. create app.ts\n\n``` ts\nimport * as rpc from 'vscode-jsonrpc';\n\nlet logger: rpc.Logger  = {\n    error: (message) => {},\n    info: (message) => {},\n    warn: (message) => {},\n    log: (message) => {}\n}\n\nlet connection = rpc.createMessageConnection(process.stdin, process.stdout, logger);\n```\n1. compile using tsc. ignore the compile errors. Not relevant for the problem\n2. create launch.json and ENABLE source maps\n3. set breakpoint in app.ts\n4. debug\n5. try to step into createMessageConnection\n\nYou get (see the exception on the call stack). I am pretty sure that before the debugger simply stepped into the JS code.\n\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1931590/19184058/95424fe8-8c7b-11e6-883c-26a167d1ff55.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13335","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13335/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13335/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13335/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13335","id":181613620,"number":13335,"title":"TSServer

VSCode Version:\n  Version 1.5.3\n  Commit 5be4091987a98e3870d89d630eb87be6d9bafd27\n  Date 2016-09-22T08:40:08.699Z\n  Shell 0.37.6\n  Renderer 49.0.2623.75\n  Node 5.10.0\n- OS Version:\n  Ubuntu 16.04.1\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open a file in the editor.\n2. Move the cursor away from the beginning of the file.\n3. Attempt to use the left arrow key to move the cursor left or attempt to use the DEL button to delete something, or page up, page down, backspace, spacebar, etc.\n\nThis egregious lack of keyboard functionality must be some issue with my environment or something. How in the world can I troubleshoot this to fix it? All of the keys work normally in every other program on my system. They even work properly in Code inside the Developer Tools window, and in other parts of the program like Explorer, but not in the editor.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13331","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13331/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13331/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13331/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13331","id":181594880,"number":13331,"title":"Integrate
