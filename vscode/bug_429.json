#22836\r\n\r\n# Feature\r\nAllow extensions to enhance to VSCode's builtin markdown preview, such as adding math support for example\r\n\r\n# Working Draft of API\r\n\r\nExtensions can enhance VSCode's markdown preview by:\r\n\r\n* Providing stylesheets for the preview page\r\n* Providing [markdown-it plugins](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it#syntax-extensions) that add support for new markdown syntax\r\n* Provide scripts that run on the preview page\r\n\r\n## Changing the Styling of the Markdown Preview\r\nTo change the styling of markdown preview page, just add a `markdown.preview` entry to the `contributes` section of your extension's `package.json`, like so:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"contributes\": {\r\n        \"markdown.preview\": {\r\n            \"styles\": [\"./my_custom_style.css\"]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`styles` should be an array of extension relative paths to CSS files. These stylesheets will be included on the markdown preview page, and will be included after the default markdown preview stylings but before the user's custom stylesheets.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using Markdown-It Plugins to Support New Markdown Syntax\r\nTo support new markdown syntax, first add `markdown-it.plugins` entry in the extension's `package.json`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"contributes\": {\r\n        \"markdown-it.plugins\": true\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis tells VSCode that your extension provides *markdown-it* plugins and that it should be activated before the markdown preview is shown. \r\n\r\nTo register the plugins themselves, in your extension's `activate` function, just return an object with an `extendMarkdownIt` method. This method takes a *markdown-it* instance and must return a modified version of that instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {\r\n    return {\r\n        extendMarkdownIt(md: any): any {\r\n            return md.use(require('markdown-it-emoji'))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nVSCode's markdown extension will invoke `extendMarkdownIt` when the markdown preview is shown for the first time.\r\n\r\n> 🎵 **Note**: Your extension can still use other activation points that are triggered before a markdown preview is ever shown. The `plugins` entry only means that your extension will be activated when the preview is first shown if it has not already been activated previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Adding a Script that is Run in the Markdown Preview\r\nIf you need further customization, you can also inject a script into the markdown preview page:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"contributes\": {\r\n        \"markdown.preview\": {\r\n            \"scripts\": [\"./my_custom_script.js\"]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`scripts` should be an array of extension relative paths to javascript files. These scripts will be included on the markdown preview page. Scripts should only be used if a common mark plugin will not work\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22916/reactions","total_count":20,"+1":15,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22915","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22915/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22915/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22915/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22915","id":215559174,"number":22915,"title":"Simplify
