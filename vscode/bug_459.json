Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI am unable to debug the [Electron Quick Start sample](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) in VS Code using the \"Node.js: Electron Main\" _launch.json_ configuration template.\r\n\r\nAlthough the code appears to stop at placed breakpoints, there is no call stack displayed. Instead the following error is displayed:\r\n\r\n> \"No call stack available (vscode_backtrace: Internal error: TypeError: undefined is not a function)\"\r\n\r\n**Note:** about once in every blue moon of starting debug, it actually works(!) This issue is temperamental, but definitely on the side of 'not working' much much more than it does work. I did not notice anything different during the times it does work.\r\n\r\n### Version info\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.10.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro (x64) 1607 (Build 14393.693)\r\n- Node.js version: v6.9.2\r\n- `electron/electron-quick-start` repository: current head of master as of 2017-03-05 ([`f8ae670c`](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start/tree/f8ae670ce85ce7329580b1085e37abb62ea3566b))\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Clone `electron/electron-quick-start` repository\r\n2. `npm install`\r\n3. Open repository folder in VSCode\r\n4. Debug tab > Configuration drop-down > Add configuration\r\n5. In _launch.json_ editor click Add Configuration... button > Node.js: Electron Main\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5658207/23588454/a3a4fffe-01b5-11e7-908a-df9c2c5331df.png)\r\n\r\n6. Add a breakpoint anywhere in _main.js_ (e.g., line 16: `mainWindow = new BrowserWindow(...)`)\r\n7. Start debugging using the \"Electron Main\" configuration\r\n\r\n#### Expected\r\n\r\n- Stop at breakpoint placed in _main.js_ and line is highlighted\r\n- Debug tab shows the call stack\r\n\r\n#### Actual\r\n\r\n- Stop at breakpoint placed in _main.js_ but line is **not** highlighted\r\n- Debug tab shows **an error: \"No call stack available (vscode_backtrace: Internal error: TypeError: undefined is not a function)\"**\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5658207/23588359/777e4256-01b4-11e7-97f3-f82647100ea3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n###

Thank you!\r\n\r\nHowever if Visual Studio Code wants to become more popular I feel like a slower release cycle would be welcomed as professionals can avoid issues that happen after speedy releases.

this suggestion: \r\n\r\nCan we create two release paths for Visual Studio Code: a fast-lane (current monthly releases) and a slower lane of quarterly releases?\r\n\r\nOf course, bug fixes and patches could be released still on a monthly basis.\r\n\r\nPeople can then pick if they would prefer updates faster or like to stick with an existing release longer.\r\nThanks for reading and your
