In particular, it:\n- Does not handle multiple cursors - it replaces all the cursors with the current search result.\n- Has a separate focus from the text editor, which can be distracting to the user because they have to think about switching between editing and searching. In contrast, Visual Studio has a simple \"inline\" [incremental search mode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f27e8wzh%28v=vs.90%29.aspx) (ctrl+i) that maintains the focus in the editor, but captures the user's typing to create a search term. I propose that the user should be able to use either input mode; each has its advantages depending on the situation.\n- Regular expression capturing groups are ignored (why not turn each captured group into its own selection?).\n\n_Use case example:_ when editing JSON, I find the multiple cursors very useful, but there are times when ctrl+left/right do not move all of the cursors to the correct position because of differences in word boundaries. I would like a way to advance each cursor to the next regexp match.\n\nTwo approaches to resolve this issue:\n1. Search is an integral function of a text editor, so build these features in.\n2. Maybe there are many ways of implementing search, so let the user pick a search extension that works for them. I have attempted to [implement this functionality as an extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=siegebell.incremental-search), but here are some of the issues blocking me from making it a \"nice\" experience:\n   - Add API support to hook into the existing search UI. I'm currently using `showInputBox` -- it works pretty well, but lacks a way to cancel the box (#9377), currently has funny behavior when validation fails (#9376), and does not allow adding buttons to toggle regexp or case sensitivity.\n   - Either provide an \"inline text input mode\" API to temporarily capture text input normally directed toward an editor without a dialog popup or change of focus, or allow an extension to implement this itself. The latter would require an API to unregister handling of the 'type' command so as not to destroy the regular editing experience (#9384).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9443","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9443/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9443/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9443/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9443","id":166114511,"number":9443,"title":"Feature Request: Horizontal split in addition to the vertical split","user":{"login":"Xoph","id":2632639,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2632639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xoph","html_url":"https://github.com/Xoph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xoph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xoph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xoph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xoph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xoph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xoph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xoph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xoph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xoph/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":30,"created_at":"2016-07-18T14:59:37Z","updated_at":"2017-10-03T14:29:25Z","closed_at":"2016-07-21T01:05:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am submitting a feature request here, because the page to do feature requests does not work (https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/293070-visual-studio-code).\n\nMy feature request is for a horizontal split in addition to a vertical split.

then means less room for open files, and requires you to manually resize it bigger and smaller when going between search and editing, if you like to have the file tree open when editing).\n\nMy suggestion would be that search should have the option to display the results in a new tab, in a similar way to Atom or Sublime, or alternatively, the search pane could be relocatable to the bottom of

Alternatively, a separate keyboard shortcut could move through the input fields – in fact, it seems `Alt+Down arrow` will move from \"search string\" to \"files to include\", but not back again.\n\nI'd be happy to try and implement this if you could advise on what a preferred solution (if any) might

everyone,\n\nI'm not sure if this is a VS Code or OmniSharp issue, so feel free to move it to the right repository if necessary.\n\nWhen I open a .Net project, I get the following in Output window:\n\n```\n[INFO] Starting OmniSharp at 'c:\\Users\\xyz\\Documents\\My Web Sites\\SomeProject'...\n[INFO] Installing to

Nothing is downloaded and my project doesn't have any kind of Intellisense (obviously).\n\nMaybe this is relevant, and maybe not, but at work, we are behind a firewall and a proxy server (from Fortinet) that does strange stuff. One of which is using its own certificate for all HTTPS requests, which I faced an issue with when using an application that require a valid  certificate signed by trusted CA, or an application that uses certificate pinning technique.\n- VSCode Version: Code 1.3.1 (e6b4afa53e9c0f54edef1673de9001e9f0f547ae, 2016-07-12T13:35:06.227Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 6.3.9600\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

Visual C#, I'm very used to visual studio prompting me solutions to common problems like adding variable declarations and creating a file with a template ready to be used.\n\nI know TypeScript is lot different than C#, these prompts speed the development process a huge bunch.\n\nIMHO, I would love to see/use :\n\n**PROBLEM FIXES**\n1. **Undeclared variables**: if a variable is not defined prompt me to add it either as a local variable a global variable or a global variable declaration\n2. **Forgotten `this`**: I wish TypeScript would stop asking me to type `this` (or make it optional :ghost:), but no I forget it all the time, would love a fast way to refactor that (one click and boom :smile:); if there is a member with that name prompt me to refactor and add it\n3. **Undeclared member values**: Also, after working with pure JS, you forget that you have to declare them in TypeScript\n4. **Undeclared instantiated/extended classes**: if say in `new Texture(\"player.png\")`, `Texture` is not yet declared prompt to add an implementation or a declaration for it\n5. **Undeclared implemented/extended interfaces**: if say in `interface B extends A {}` or `class C implements A`, `A` is not yet declared prompt to add an a declaration for it\n6. **Undeclared callable**: you know the gist, if its a function/method call ask me to declare it\n7. **Declare in a new file**: would love for **4** and **6** to add the option to declare them in a separate file, just the class declaration as default and make the template configurable globally or per project\n\n**PS**: please make it work also with Symbols\n\n**CODE GEN**\n1. **Genarate a constructor**<sup>*</sup>\n2. **Generate getters and setters**<sup>*</sup>: C# property equiv.\n3. **Generate getters**<sup>*</sup>\n4. **Generate setters**<sup>*</sup>\n5. **Extract method**: when a statement or more are selected, add extraction utility\n6. **Generate method**\n7. **Generate toString**\n8. **Generate [Symbol.iterator]**\n\n<sup>*</sup>: from member declarations\n\n**PS**: in **2** here is what I meant;\n\n``` TypeScript\nprivate _name: string;\npublic get name() { return this._name; }\npublic set
