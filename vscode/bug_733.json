the `debugServer` property in launch.json is at the same level of `version` - that is, it's global.\nIn my opinion it would make more sense for it to be under the specific configurations; the benefits would be:\n- the extensions can fill launch.json appropriately (as far as I can see extensions can easily provide configurations when they are first clicked in the debug gear dropdown, but not global properties to launch.json)\n- debug extensions using programs and ones using debugServer properties could be mixed-up in the same project \n\nOf course there is a high change that I'm missing

Please don't close this until this is fixed.\n\nOnly workaround that actually works: \n1. open same directory in sublime and then edit code without any issues (albeit with inferior typescript and intellisense support)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5864474/19401445/a868a11a-9218-11e6-8709-c912790250ed.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13781/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13780","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13780/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13780/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13780/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13780","id":183129261,"number":13780,"title":"Duplicate selected text or area","user":{"login":"miladghiravani","id":5067331,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5067331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani","html_url":"https://github.com/miladghiravani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":427411234,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/extension-candidate","name":"extension-candidate","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-14T19:14:24Z","updated_at":"2017-06-07T00:21:13Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.6.1\n- OS Version: Windows 8.1 Enterprise 64-bit\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nHi,\nThis feature is best to speed up programming.

In a Typescript file, start with this base code:\n\n``` typescript\nabstract class Parent {\n    /**\n     * Function that can be overriden.\n     */\n    public abstract toOverride(param1, param2): number;\n\n    public canBeOverridden(param1) { }\n}\n\nclass Child extends Parent {\n\n}\n```\n1. In the `Child` class, try to implement the function toOverride : no autocompletion is proposed, yet TS shows the error `Non-abstract class 'Child' does not implement inherited abstract member 'toOverride' from class 'Parent'.` when hovering the class name until we actually write a function with the same signature, which means it knows the missing function's signature.\n2. When the function has been implemented in `Child`, the parent function's doc isn't reflected in the overriding function, even if it has no doc. I can imagine why it is so, but that means we have to copy paste the doc for it to actually show up when we use `Child.toOverride()`.\n3. It doesn't work either with non-abstract functions, nor getter/setters, etc. \n\nFull code:\n\n``` typescript\nabstract class Parent {\n    /**\n     * This doc will only show up for `Parent` instances,\n     * or objets treated as `Parent`.\n     */\n    public abstract toOverride(param1, param2): number;\n\n    public canBeOverridden(param1) { }\n}\n\nclass Child extends Parent {\n    // No completion has been provided while implementing this function\n    public toOverride(p, p2): number {\n        return 2;\n    }\n}\n\nnew Child().toOverride(1, 2); // The doc doesn't show up when hovering toOverride.\n(new Child() as Parent).toOverride(1, 2); // The doc shows up when hovering toOverride.\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13778","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13778/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13778/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13778/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13778","id":183108835,"number":13778,"title":"Updated HTML coloring has issue with separator comments","user":{"login":"FremyCompany","id":364405,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/364405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FremyCompany","html_url":"https://github.com/FremyCompany","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FremyCompany/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FremyCompany/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FremyCompany/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FremyCompany/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FremyCompany/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FremyCompany/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FremyCompany/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FremyCompany/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FremyCompany/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-14T17:40:09Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T08:25:24Z","closed_at":"2016-10-17T08:24:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.6.1 (9e4e44c19e393803e2b05fe2323cf4ed7e36880e, 2016-10-13T16:21:53.542Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14942\n- Extensions: \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

But there's no inline error shown when you have the cursor on the line where the error occurs. Compare VSCode:\n\n![screen shot 2016-10-13 at 01 03 09](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50314/19337201/da5db086-90e0-11e6-97e0-dff000c2d328.png)\n\nAnd Atom with the go-plus plugin:\n\n![screen shot 2016-10-13 at 01 00 35](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50314/19337172/85dcf7f6-90e0-11e6-9f82-159cd0b4d703.png)\n\nFor me, Atom is a lot better here. I don't want to shift my focus to the \"Problems\" panel every time there's an error, and using the mouse isn't how I work in an editor.\n\nInterestingly, the \"go to next marker\" keyboard shortcut (F8 by default) _does_ trigger an inline error description. But only then:\n\n![screen shot 2016-10-13 at 01 06 01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50314/19337256/7af130e0-90e1-11e6-8bac-3b829085e852.png)\n\n(That particular behaviour is a bit visually unsettling as it actually _inserts_ a line in the editor, rather than showing a floating tooltip. Inserting lines immediately on error would be fine, but it removes the line when you jump to the next error. It also doesn't go away if you fix the error.)\n\n_Copied from original issue:

When the user selects an item, we call openTextDocument then showTextDocument like this:\n\n``` ts\nvs.window.showQuickPick(tree.map(item => itemToPick(item, items)), options).then(result => {\n    if (result) {\n        let location: as.Location = result['location'];\n        vs.workspace.openTextDocument(location.file).then(document => {\n            vs.window.showTextDocument(document).then(editor => {\n                // stuff\n            });\n        });\n    }\n});\n```\n\nI'm testing with a single file, where all code is in the same file (so `openTextDocument` and `showTextDocument` are both effectively doing nothing at all; the file is both open and visible). However, between calling showTextDocument and the chained method being called there appears to be quite a delay:\n\n``` ts\nconsole.log('Calling openTextDocument: ' + new Date().getTime());\nvs.workspace.openTextDocument(location.file).then(document => {\n    console.log('Calling showTextDocument: ' + new Date().getTime());\n    vs.window.showTextDocument(document).then(editor => {\n        console.log('showTextDocument done: ' + new Date().getTime());\n```\n\noutputs:\n\n``` text\nCalling openTextDocument: 1476459604276\nCalling showTextDocument: 1476459604277\nshowTextDocument done: 1476459605282\n```\n\nThere is **1005ms** between the last two timestamps. This results in a noticeable delay to the user in selecting the range (which we do inside that chained function).\n\nI can't see any obvious reason why this would stall for so long (especially given it's not doing anything; the file is open (the only open file) and visible).\n\nThe file file with our code is [here](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/blob/18196fbc8586ec245acb4c0afbaa987efa37e513/src/commands/type_hierarchy.ts).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13770","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13770/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13770/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13770/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13770","id":183079243,"number":13770,"title":"Provide a restart workbench command","user":{"login":"trajano","id":110627,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/110627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trajano","html_url":"https://github.com/trajano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trajano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trajano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trajano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trajano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trajano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trajano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trajano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trajano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trajano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-10-14T15:25:42Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T15:59:24Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.6.1\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
