VSCode Version: 1.14.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 7 and Windows 10, likely all OSes\r\n\r\nWhen editing documents with very long lines, such as lines containing data-URIs, the property `vscode.window.activeTextEditor` will be `undefined` when it should be defined.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new (blank) VSCode extension, and add this command to `extension.ts`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'use strict';\r\nimport * as vscode from 'vscode';\r\n\r\nexport function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {\r\n    let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('bigDocTest.runDocTest', () => {\r\n\r\n        let hasActiveTextEditor = (vscode.window.activeTextEditor !== undefined);\r\n\r\n        if (hasActiveTextEditor) {\r\n            vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Success, activeTextEditor is defined.');\r\n        } else {\r\n            vscode.window.showErrorMessage('Oops, activeTextEditor is not defined.');\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    context.subscriptions.push(disposable);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function deactivate() {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Launch this extension, load any normal text file, and run this command, you see the \"Success, activeTextEditor is defined\" information message appear.\r\n\r\n3. But, try loading a file with a very long line contained inside it, such as this one: [MetalRoughSpheres.gltf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/9ba6ae1352c8b59f684a11858b152615026660a4/2.0/MetalRoughSpheres/glTF-Embedded/MetalRoughSpheres.gltf).  This file has long lines due to the use of embedded data URIs in the file.  If you run the above sample extension while editing this file, you see \"Oops, activeTextEditor is not defined.\"\r\n\r\nThis makes it difficult for VSCode extensions to work with such files.  I'm the lead dev of the GLTF extension for VSCode, and this prevents my extension from running on GLTF files that embed large images as data URIs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31077","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31077/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31077/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31077/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31077","id":244178827,"number":31077,"title":"Regex Find works differently than Find in Files","user":{"login":"aaronkavlie-wf","id":7768348,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7768348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkavlie-wf","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronkavlie-wf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkavlie-wf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkavlie-wf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkavlie-wf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkavlie-wf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkavlie-wf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkavlie-wf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkavlie-wf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkavlie-wf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronkavlie-wf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-07-19T21:24:33Z","updated_at":"2017-07-31T21:09:30Z","closed_at":"2017-07-31T20:35:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The **Find** command, with regex turned on, seems to be implemented with a different flavor of regex than the **Find in Files** command.

@benesch have all recently reported the same problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. open vscode to a git project\r\n2. switch away from vscode to a terminal\r\n3. touch a file in in git project\r\n4. observe the blue \"clock\" on top of the version control icon flashes in vscode\r\n5. occasionally, trying to do a rebase in the terminal window with vscode open in the background will fail with `fatal: Unable to create '.git/index.lock': File exists`\r\n\r\nYou can avoid the problem with `\"git.autorefresh\": false`, but it's sad to have to lose all the functionality just to avoid this problem.  I posit that the protections against background `git status` calls added in faeb58e were lost when the git code was refactored into an extension.\r\n\r\nI've gone so far as to run this in the background, but it's a bit convoluted to expect people to do that.\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env osascript -l JavaScript\r\n\r\nfunction run(argv) {\r\n    var app = Application.currentApplication()\r\n    app.includeStandardAdditions = true\r\n\r\n    vscode = Application('Electron')\r\n    // add git.autorefresh to user config file if it isn't already there\r\n    app.doShellScript('grep -q

\"git.autorefresh\": true\\\\n}$2%s\\' ~/Library/Application\\\\ Support/Code/User/settings.json')\r\n    while (vscode.running()) {\r\n        delay(1)\r\n        if (vscode.frontmost()) {\r\n

Run the Python debug for script.py\r\n\r\n3. The console is set to integratedTerminal as the debug console will otherwise swallow the output. On my own system the output first lists all of the my shell ENV variables, then again iterates them one at a time. It looks like it dies when it hits the LS_COLORS and is interpreting the internal `=` as a split between an environment variable key and value:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nLC_CTYPE=en_CA.UTF-8\r\nSETTING=1\r\nWINDOWID=96468997\r\nzsh: command not found: 34:ln=01\r\nzsh: command not found: 36:mh=00:pi=40\r\nzsh: command not found:

required for the python debug.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: Removing the .envFile setting from the launch.json profile resolves the issue, or otherwise setting the values in the launch.json .env setting also avoids the problem - so it seems there is some difference in how the .envFile settings are being applied over the ones in .env.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31064","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31064/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31064/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31064/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31064","id":244128050,"number":31064,"title":"Support
