To enable this you need to add a global property `\"_runner\": \"terminal\"` to the tasks.json file.\r\n\r\nExecuting a task in a terminal should work as executing a task in the output windows including problem matcher, watching task (now named background tasks) and commands per task. When a task is executed in  the terminal you get the additional features:\r\n\r\n- output encoding plus full ANSI character support (comes for free from the terminal)\r\n- input (the task can read from stdin)  (comes for free from the terminal)\r\n- you can run more than one task in parallel.\r\n- control over the shell to be used.\r\n\r\nPlease test that all the features available in the 'output' runner work in the 'terminal' runner plus the newly mentioned features. Try to kill a n active task F1 > task terminate. The terminal runner tries to reuse terminals. Ensure that the reuse strategy makes sense. Play a little with task executed in the terminal. If you have ideas, please let me know. Executing them in the terminal opens new use cases. \r\n\r\nPlease also note that due to a problem in the terminal command quoting when executed in a shell doesn't work as expected. So a command like `\"dir \"folder with spaces\"\"` is not correctly executed in a cmd.exe run in the terminal. See https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19078 for details: \r\n\r\nHere is a sample tasks.json to start with:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n    \"_runner\": \"terminal\",\r\n    \"tasks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"taskName\": \"tsc\",\r\n            \"command\": \"tsc -w\",\r\n            \"isShellCommand\": true,\r\n            \"isBackground\": true,\r\n            \"problemMatcher\": \"$tsc-watch\",\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"taskName\": \"dir\",\r\n            \"command\": \"dir\",\r\n            \"windows\": {\r\n                \"isShellCommand\": {\r\n                    \"executable\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\cmd.exe\",\r\n                    \"args\": [\"/d\", \"/c\"]\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        } \r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first task executes the tsc compiler in watch mode (assumes it is available globally). The second one executes the dir command using a special shell path for the terminal.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19057/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19056","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19056/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19056/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19056/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19056","id":202585828,"number":19056,"title":"[WelcomeUX] Include a guide/hint for 'View: Toggle Panel' (CTRL+J)","user":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-01-23T16:40:51Z","updated_at":"2017-04-17T20:01:45Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Testing #18091 \r\n\r\nInclude a guide/hint for 'View: Toggle Panel' (CTRL+J) to increase the discoverability of the Panel switching.

Git is halfway implemented on top of it. In order to test it, you must run the `SCM: Enable Preview SCM` global command.\r\n\r\nBefore filing for missing features, refer to #18615, where most of those are tracked.\r\n\r\n- Test that the `SCM: Enable Preview SCM` and `SCM: Disable Preview SCM` work as advertised: they should toggle between having the classic git UI to having the new SCM viewlet\r\n- Test that when Preview SCM is disabled, git works just as before\r\n- With Preview SCM enabled:\r\n  - Test that the viewlet's contents always match what `git status` would show\r\n  - Test the diff editor which opens upon click of the viewlet's items\r\n  - Test that there are still dirty diff decorations in the gutter margin of the editor\r\n  - Test staging, undoing and unstaging commands/actions\r\n  - Test commit command\r\n  - Test sync, pull, push & publish commands\r\n  - Test that merge conflict decorations appear highlighted\r\n  - Test that you can checkout branches using the status bar & global command\r\n  - Test that you can create branches using the global command\r\n  - Test the viewlet menu actions as well as context actions\r\n  - Test that the git output channel's content makes sense\r\n  - Test that there's a `git fetch` every now and then (check the git output)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19048","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19048/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19048/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19048/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19048","id":202573149,"number":19048,"title":"Syntax highlighter confused by class properties with optional type","user":{"login":"kevinbarabash","id":1044413,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1044413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbarabash","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinbarabash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbarabash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbarabash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbarabash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbarabash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbarabash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbarabash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbarabash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbarabash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinbarabash/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":293379998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/languages%20basic","name":"languages basic","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":291055694,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/typescript","name":"typescript","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-23T15:56:21Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T07:14:35Z","closed_at":"2017-01-25T07:14:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.8.1\r\n- OS Version: Mac OS X, 10.11.5\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.

The following properties can be specified:\r\n\r\ncommand: string - the command to execute\r\nisShellCommand: boolean - whether the command is a shell command\r\nargs: string[] - arguments passed to the command.\r\noptions: { cwd: string, env: any } - spawn options\r\n\r\nTest the following:\r\n\r\n- that a task can take these arguments\r\n- that there are OS specific overrides per task (windows, osx, linux)\r\n- that the merging rule make sense and are correct. They should behave like this. `command` and `isShellCommand` are overriding, arguments are concatenated, options.cwd is overriding and options.env are merged.\r\n\r\nAnd example is:\r\n```json\r\n        {\r\n            \"taskName\": \"node\",\r\n            \"command\": \"node\",\r\n            \"linux\": {\r\n                \"command\": \"/usr/bin/node\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"args\": [\r\n                \"helloWorld.js\"\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCommands can still be defined globally and globally per OS. If a command is defined globally and per task (`command`, `isShellCommand` or `options` property set) the definition setting the command property wins without merging `isShellCommand`, `options` or `args` properties. This is done to keep the overall command definition as local as possible.\r\n\r\nInstead of testing this per task augmenting the `src\\vs\\workbench\\parts\\tasks\\test\\node\\configuration.test.ts` is also a possibility.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19043","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19043/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19043/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19043/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19043","id":202567466,"number":19043,"title":"Test: support to launch an adapter through an extension","user":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/33","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/33","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/33/labels","id":2133194,"number":33,"title":"January 2017","description":"","creator":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":738,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-11-14T11:19:32Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T13:32:32Z","due_on":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-02-03T06:13:52Z"},"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-01-23T15:37:00Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T14:05:44Z","closed_at":"2017-01-26T14:05:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Test for #8645:\r\nComplexity: 3\r\n\r\n- [x] Windows - @bpasero  \r\n- [x] Linux - @roblourens\r\n\r\nPreviously VS Code has launched a debug adapter by using the (static) attributes `program`,  `args`, `runtime` and `runtimeArgs` from the package.json of the corresponding extension.\r\nWith this milestone this information can be dynamically calculated by a command implemented in an extension.\r\n\r\nTo verify:\r\n- check out any debug extension, e.g. vscode-node-debug\r\n- remove the attributes `program`,  `args`, `runtime` and `runtimeArgs` from the package.json (not all are used in all extensions)\r\n- set a new attribute `adapterExecutableCommand` to an ID of a command that is registered in the extension.\r\n- make this command return a structure with this format:\r\n  ```json\r\n  command: \"<executable>\",\r\n  args: [ \"<argument1>\", \"<argument2>\", ... ]\r\n  ```\r\nThe attribute \"command\" must be a either an absolute path to an executable or a name of executable looked up via the PATH environment variable.
