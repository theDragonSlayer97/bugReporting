idea but I'll give you how the project is setup.\r\n\r\nMy issue is that vscode is automatically inserting 4 spaces into my code with formatOnSave when I open a new file which is already indented with 2 spaces.\r\n\r\nsettings.json\r\n```\r\n// Place your settings in this file to overwrite the default settings\r\n{\r\n  \"editor.formatOnSave\": true,\r\n  \"editor.fontSize\": 13,\r\n

file to overwrite default and user settings.\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy files otherwise run on eslint with the following .eslintrc file:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"root\": true,\r\n  \"extends\":

I first click on \"Indent Using spaces\" and choose \"3\". I then edit the file and save, this fixes the spacing from 4 to 3. Then I redo the step and select \"2\", edit and save and the file then rejumps to 2 spaces.\r\n\r\nIt states that my tab is set to 4 spaces. \r\n\r\nI don't understand as I have auto indentation set to true. Rest of the people in my project do not have any issues. Then again, none of them are using vscode.\r\n\r\nAnymore info?

ask!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17078","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17078/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17078/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17078/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17078","id":194983035,"number":17078,"title":"Insert

Create a new Handlebars file\r\n2. Add the following content:\r\n```hbs\r\n<div onclick={{if foo (action \"bar\")}}>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nVS Code displays a false error after the `if` (`'(' expected`). \r\n<img width=\"321\"

there, I assume it tries to validate the text as Javascript (in which case the expected bracket would make sense).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17077/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/17076","id":194981312,"number":17076,"title":"Fix

vscode would update the UI while searching with results that have thus far been found. In my opinion this is a much nicer user experience, especially in larger projects where full project searches can take up a long time to complete. If the desired result is found early in the search, the user should be able to select the result and jump to the code (the search should just keep going until it is completed, or if the user aborts it).\r\n\r\nRelates to #16403","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4739","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"B7AF:429A:84995E:16493E5:59D93E58","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=624>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=622>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"30df5269ad2ed3a57037a63e9ead1234\"","status":"200 OK"}}
