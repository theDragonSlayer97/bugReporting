It's kind of annoying to type EVERYTHING by hand, I think it would be nice to have Intellisense like in Visual Studio. It gets tiring typing \"\\documentclass{article}\" and the \"using System;\" then \"namespace {name}\" then \"class Program {}\" then \"static void Main(string[] args) {}\" again and again and again. I've been using Notepad++ as a replacement until this can get fixed. It's also annoying how it doesn't recognize classes and methods that I've called by typing by hand previously. i.e. \"Console.WriteLine();\" over and over again. Intellisense stopped working after I did an update for VS Code and is annoying. Any way to install older versions of VS Code to get Intellisense working again maybe?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31164","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31164/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31164/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31164/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31164","id":244521559,"number":31164,"title":"Node JS Debugging often incredibly slow","user":{"login":"dungeontiger","id":1786197,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1786197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dungeontiger","html_url":"https://github.com/dungeontiger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dungeontiger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dungeontiger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dungeontiger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dungeontiger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dungeontiger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dungeontiger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dungeontiger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dungeontiger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dungeontiger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-07-20T23:09:23Z","updated_at":"2017-07-21T09:53:46Z","closed_at":"2017-07-21T00:06:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sometimes its fine, most of the time it is unusably slow.

Mouse over the class/object/variable you tried to document and see that everything is rendered as plain text.\r\n\r\nVSCode will display JSDoc comments as documentation on mouseover, however with it rendering any html markup as plaintext, comments that would normally display with orderly lists, line breaks, and paragraphs is all mashed together in a cluttered mess with no new lines.\r\n\r\nFor example the Jsdoc in the first step renders as:\r\n```\r\nCreates a Header\r\n<ul><li> First Item </li><li> Second Item </li></ul>\r\n@description <p> Description tags are supposed to support HTML formatting </p>\r\n@constructor\r\n@param {Streamer} in_stream - (Optional) An \"inbound\" stream with data to be read.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did notice that if you do this:\r\n```\r\n/** Blah blah blah\r\n*\r\n* Own Line\r\n*\r\n* Another Line\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\nVsCode will render this as:\r\n```\r\nBlah blah blah\r\nOwn Line\r\nAnother Line\r\n```\r\nwhen you mouseover the documented item. Note that to get \"Own Line\" and \"Another Line\" on their own lines, it took an extra blank line.\r\n\r\nPlease do not render html tags in comments, or at least treat ```</br>, <p>``` etc. as new lines so that there is some semblance of formatting being applied to displayed documentation. Writing jsdoc comments that are intended to render nicely in VSCode require an inordinate amount of wasted lines just to accomplish what a``` <p> ``` or ```</br>``` would accomplish on the same line.\r\n\r\nWith how things are now you have to pick between displaying Jsdoc documentation nicely in HTML, or have it readable in VScode, you can't have both without one or the other being poorly formatted if not unreadable.\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes/No","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31160","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31160/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31160/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31160/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31160","id":244505117,"number":31160,"title":"Editor rulers disappear at lower zoom levels","user":{"login":"jdatskuid","id":26011664,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/26011664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdatskuid","html_url":"https://github.com/jdatskuid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdatskuid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdatskuid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdatskuid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdatskuid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdatskuid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdatskuid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdatskuid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdatskuid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdatskuid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":425577013,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-core","name":"editor-core","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-20T21:42:40Z","updated_at":"2017-08-15T17:29:28Z","closed_at":"2017-08-15T17:29:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.14.0-insider (6afdf303bb8f70d840c12a43c036e98a9da50d41, 2017-07-05T09:01:45.828Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.6.0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
