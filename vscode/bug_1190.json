To fix it, create the jsconfig.json file which sets the target to ES6:\n\n```\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"ES6\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe error is still showing, now incorrectly.\n\nIf I rename \"temp.js\" to \"test.js\" (or anything that doesn't start with 'temp') the error goes away. Or, if I create a files array in jsconfig.json which lists \"temp.js\", the error goes away:\n\n```\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"ES6\"\n    },\n    \"files\": [\n
