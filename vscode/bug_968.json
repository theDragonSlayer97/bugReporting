VSCode Version: 1.1.1\n- OS Version: Windows 7, Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nSee https://github.com/yortus/repro-build-bug for full repro details and a cut-down project.\n\nFrom the README:\n## Bug Repro\n### Problem Description\n- Building a project with `Shift+Ctrl+B` puts some built files in the wrong location\n### Environment\n- **O/S**: Windows 7 and Windows 10\n- **VSCode**: v1.1.1\n- **Node.js**: v6.2\n- **TypeScript**: v1.9.0-dev.20160524-1.0\n### Steps to Reproduce\n##### Project setup\n1. `git clone https://github.com/yortus/repro-build-bug.git`\n2. `cd repro-build-bug`\n3. `npm install`\n##### Baseline build/run (this should work fine)\n1. Open a command prompt\n2. Build from the command prompt using `npm run build`\n   - should be no errors, and `/built` will contain built `.js` files\n3. Run from the command prompt using `node .`\n   - should be no errors, outputs `\"Hello, World!\"` to console\n##### VSCode build/run (this should repro the bug)\n1. Open the project folder in VSCode\n2. Delete the `/built` directory created in the previous steps\n3. Build from VSCode by pressing `Shift+Ctrl+B`\n   - should be no errors, but one `.js` file is output to `/built` and the other to `/src`\n4. Run from the command prompt using `node .`\n   - should show an error `\"cannot find module...\"` because of the wrong placement of built files\n### Further Notes\n- Bug could not be reproduced on linux\n- Bug could not be reproduced with node v4 or v5.\n- Bug goes away if `\"options\": {\"cwd\": \"<absolute project path>\"}` is added to `.vscode/tasks.json`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6718","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6718/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6718/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6718/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6718","id":156447292,"number":6718,"title":"changing
