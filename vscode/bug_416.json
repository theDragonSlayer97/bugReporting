I wish VScode can  remember all the tabstops for previous snippets as well, not only the recent one.\r\n\r\n\r\nUltisnips has become one of the most important killer-plugins for vim since it supports this powerful feature. We might refer to it.\r\n\r\n## In detail:\r\nLet us say we have the following simple snippet. This will expand `printf(\"\\n\");` with the prefix of `prf`. It contains 3 tabstops.\r\n```\r\n\"printf\": {\r\n\t\t\"prefix\": \"prf\",\r\n\t\t\"body\": [\r\n\t\t\t\"printf(\\\"${1:%s}\\\\n\\\"$2);$3\"\r\n\t\t],\t\r\n\t\t\"description\": \"printf snippet\"\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I type `prf<tab>`, my cursor will be located after the first double quote so I can type some strings. \r\nJust for a test, let me try to expand another prf snippet there. So the total typings would be:\r\n`prf<tab>prf<tab>`\r\nand then the result would be\r\n`\"printf(\"printf(\"%s\\n\");\\n\");`\r\n\r\nHowever, if I press tabstop jump trigger (which I mapped to `<c-j>` instead of the default `<tab>` to avoid confusion), the cursor only moves to \r\n```\r\n\"printf(\"printf(\"%s\\n\");\\n\");\r\n                     ^ ^\r\n            here and here, not further\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know not many editors are supporting this feature (except for vim and emacs). This is a necessary, killer feature required for VScode in order to fully migrate from vim. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23315","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23315/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23315/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23315/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23315","id":217394210,"number":23315,"title":"Test: Keybindings & Keyboard Dispatching changes","user":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/37","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/37","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/37/labels","id":2317844,"number":37,"title":"March 2017","description":"","creator":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":663,"state":"closed","created_at":"2017-02-13T07:33:31Z","updated_at":"2017-06-25T20:58:50Z","due_on":"2017-03-31T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-04-06T09:12:10Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-03-27T22:30:18Z","updated_at":"2017-03-29T03:35:39Z","closed_at":"2017-03-29T03:35:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Test for #17521\r\n\r\n- [x] Windows - @mousetraps \r\n- [x] Linux - @rebornix \r\n- [x] Mac - @jrieken \r\n\r\nComplexity: 4\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\n**There should be no observable difference compared to the previous VS Code stable version (i.e. dispatching still works on `e.keyCode`)**. There are a few improvements, we now detect keyboard layout changes and we display some dead key based keybindings better.\r\n\r\nNote: this is not a test plan of default keyboard shortcuts. Based on keyboard layouts, defaults might be all over the place (i.e. poor). We do not ship with kb layout specific default shortcuts.\r\n\r\nPlease check by sampling that we render the correct labels for keybindings in the kb layouts: US, Latin American, UK, German, French. Hint: I use the touch keyboard to validate. (i.e. please pick an action, find its keybinding from our UI, press those key, validate that action executes, do this multiple times). You can use `Developer: Inspect Key Mappings` to take a look behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n### Linux & Mac\r\n\r\n**There should be no observable difference compared to the previous VS Code stable version for the US keyboard layout**. On Mac, we detect keyboard layout changes.\r\n\r\nNote: this is not a test plan of default keyboard shortcuts. Based on keyboard layouts, defaults might be all over the place (i.e. poor). We do not ship with kb layout specific default shortcuts.\r\n\r\nKey code based default shortcuts will be transformed, with heuristics to scan code based shortcuts. The heuristics are about what each scan code combination produces. e.g. ctrl+/ is ctrl+shift+7 on GER because shift+7 produces /. This is a heuristic and there might be edge cases where it might not work well.\r\n\r\nRecording a keypress might sometimes (depends on heuristics) resort to using scan codes (i.e. the define keybinding widget). Scan codes look like \"[This]\".\r\n\r\nPlease check by sampling that we render the correct labels for keybindings in the kb layouts: \r\n* mac: US, Spanish, British, German, French\r\n* linux: us, gb, latam, br, es,  \r\nPlease also use the define keybinding widget and check that what you press results in something that can be persisted in `keybindings.json` and repeated (pressing it again triggers the bound command under the same kb layout).\r\n\r\nHint: I use the keyboard utilities that render a kb on screen to validate (i.e. please pick an action, find its keybinding from our UI, press those key, validate that action executes, do this multiple times).

Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.11.6\r\n\r\nHello there, I've developed an extension which works under `extension development mode`, but if I installed it from a vsce generated packages, extension's commands are shown when I type `CMD + Shift + P`, but cannot be invoked, it returns `commandX not found` error. Also in the `activate()` method of my extension it should show an information message about extension is activated, however such message is not shown if I installed the package locally (Extension is activated in any events).\r\n\r\nI've tested it under macOS and Linux, it seems under macOS extension is enabled (I can only disable or uninstall from extension tab) and under Linux it cannot enabled, it constantly shows a reload button despite of if you've pressed it before.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. `vsce package // One warning: Couldn't detect the repository where this extension is published. Images might be broken in its README.`\r\n2. `code --install-extension extension.vsix // Returns extension successfully installed`\r\n3.  `code .`\r\n4. `CMD + Shift + P`\r\n5. `Select command X from dropdown \\\\ command x not found`\r\n\r\nPiece of my extension code:\r\n```typescript\r\nexport function activate(ctx: vscode.ExtensionContext) {\r\n  vscode.window.showInformationMessage(\"Activating extension\")\r\n\r\n  ctx.subscriptions.push(vscode.commands.registerCommand('ext.initWorkspace', () => {\r\n    initWorkspace()\r\n  }));\r\n\r\n

defined in a new JSON file format that holds syntax token colors as well as workbench colors. Additionally a custom theme can also be defined in the settings.\r\n\r\nTo test, define your own custom theme based on built-in theme, e.g. 'Red'. \r\n- add to your settings:\r\n```json\r\n\t\"workbench.colorTheme\": \"Custom Theme\",\r\n\t\"workbench.customColorTheme\": {\r\n\t\t\"extends\": \"Red\",\r\n\t\t\"type\": \"dark\",\r\n\t\t\"colors\": {\r\n\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n- use code completion to see the available color keys. Color values must be in the form #RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA.\r\n- Verify that the existing color keys work\r\n- Try to find good colors for the all missing colors in our built-in themes\r\n   - make a PR with the updated theme. The goal is that we can update some of the themes for March, in particular Kimbie Dark, Red, Solarized Dark and Tomorrow Blue.\r\n   - To convert a tmTheme to a .json file: `node ./build/npm/update-theme.js ./extensions/theme-kimbie-dark/themes/Kimbie_dark.tmTheme ./extensions/theme-kimbie-dark/themes/kimbie-dark-color-theme.json`\r\n   - there are plenty of colors that are not themable yet. No need to file a bug for each, but please so for the ones that disturb the theming experience most.\r\n  - feedback on any area, be it the custom color theme setting or color key names is highly welcome. This is all considered work in progress.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23294/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23293","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23293/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23293/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23293/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23293","id":217282417,"number":23293,"title":"Standalone
