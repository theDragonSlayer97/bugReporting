guys\n\nI was wondering if the following scenario is possible:\nWhen I register my custom `CodeCompletionProvider` (which now works like a charm, thanks to Johannes Rieken), the default provider from VSCode is kinda deactivated.\n\nWhen I explicitly call the suggestions, it more or less works, but not on all scenarios.\n\nI'd like to merge the results of my provider with the original providers of vscode. Or at least extend the base result with my results.\n\nThe problem is, if I overwrite the default provider and deliver non imported symbols to complete, stuff like `[].some` or other array functions are not completable anymore. My completionprovider does not index those functions, so there are not visible anymore.\n\nIt would be cool if both information would be there.\n\nCheers\nChris\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11934","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11934/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11934/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11934/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11934","id":176576133,"number":11934,"title":"Not

VS opened, could be on the git pane.\n- In a terminal, performed git operations such as a rebase.\n\nYou can see that VS attempts to update the git view, even though it hasn't got the focus.\n\nThis
