As far as I see it is really the template tag and all it's content that is completely ignored by the formatter. \nOther HTML files are formatted properly. When using modern component-based frameworks like Aurelia, you're writing nothing else than templates and for me auto-formatting is indispensable.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. create a .html file\n2. paste in an example template with messed up indentation like:\n   \n   ```\n   <template>\n   <require from=\"components/nav-bar.html\"></require>\n   <require from=\"bootstrap/css/bootstrap.css\"></require>\n   <nav-bar router.bind=\"router\"></nav-bar>\n   <div class=\"page-host\">\n   <router-view></router-view>\n   </div>\n   </template>\n   ```\n3. Press _Alt+Shift+F_ to format the file\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7124","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7124/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7124/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7124/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7124","id":158093962,"number":7124,"title":"Reveal in File Tree as Menu-Option/Shortcut","user":{"login":"m4w","id":1598385,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1598385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4w","html_url":"https://github.com/m4w","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4w/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4w/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4w/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4w/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4w/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4w/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4w/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4w/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4w/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-06-02T09:14:38Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T11:41:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.1.0\n\nIt would be a great feature to have a right click menu option on a \"Working File\"-file to reveal a file in the file tree, as well as a shortcut for the same.\nThis is essential, if you deactivate the `explorer.autoReveal` feature. \n\nI do not want to always (aka. automaticly) reveal a file in the filetree.

Start any meteor application via \"meteor debug\"\n2. When node pauses, attached debugger \n       {\n           \"name\": \"Attach Server\",\n           \"type\": \"node\",\n           \"request\": \"attach\",\n           \"port\": 5858,\n           \"address\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n           \"restart\": true,\n           \"sourceMaps\": true,\n           \"outDir\": null,\n           \"localRoot\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\n           \"remoteRoot\": null\n       },\n3. The program pauses for debugging perfectly..\n4. Add, remove or change any line of source or even change location of debugger statement and save.\n5. detach debugger.\n6. Break out of meteor instance (ctrl-c).\n7. Start meteor via \"meteor debug\" (#1 above)\n8. Attach debugger (#2 above)\n\nISSUE:\n9. The program WILL pause at the new debugger location and correctly run the code changes, however the source map shows the source before modification (obviously making debugging impossible).  To correct and get the source map recreated/updated I need to closing VSCode and re-starting, then re-attaching the debugger.\n\nSide Issue:  The 'F9' debug breaks don't work at all when attaching to meteor application line above, I have to use 'debugger' statements.  It'd be so much more convenient use pause with F9 breaks.. F9 works just fine when launching a straight node application, not sure what the difference is or if I'm doing something wrong?\n\nBTW, VSCode kicks ass, thanks for building this, it's so fast and nice to work with.. I've been using Webstorm for node/meteor for years, I switched, the speed of the application is night & day (debugging is where is really hit home though (except for having to type 'debugger' all over :)). \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7116","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7116/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7116/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7116/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7116","id":158068160,"number":7116,"title":"Powerline fonts in terminal incorrect","user":{"login":"jchannon","id":105126,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/105126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchannon","html_url":"https://github.com/jchannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchannon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":19,"created_at":"2016-06-02T06:27:45Z","updated_at":"2017-07-08T20:36:02Z","closed_at":"2016-06-15T18:03:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.2.0-insiders\n- OS Version: OSX\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
