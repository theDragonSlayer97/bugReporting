VSCode Version:Version 1.8.0-insider\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. New feature request\r\n\r\nCurrently in vscode, user can associate a shortcut to a command (or) can add a right click menu item to perform an operation either in the editor/sidebar/panel.\r\n\r\nBut IntelliJ has an additional type of provision to allow developers to contribute to generators via `alt+insert` key. This allows additional context dependent actions to be added.\r\n\r\nFor eg., if you press `alt+insert` in typescript editor, you will see actions that allows you to perform operations on the typescript file, such as generate setter,create constructor, e.t.c\r\n\r\nIf you press the same combination in explorer on a directory, you will see popup-actions to add a new file/new directory/new typescript/e.t.c\r\n\r\nThis `alt+insert` is a powerful way to reduce the total number of shortcuts, as it allows the contributors to target this `alt+insert` instead of forcing the user to remember a lot of shortcuts for every action. This shortcut is context dependent & allows structural modifications to the current panel/editor at hand.\r\n\r\nPlease check if this can be added to the core so that developers can contribute in a better way at the same time it will be less overhead on the user aswell, as user will then only need to remember `alt+insert` instead of a lot of shortcuts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16337","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16337/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16337/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16337/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16337","id":192930519,"number":16337,"title":"In-product release notes h2 and h3 links cause topic to go blank","user":{"login":"gregvanl","id":12818376,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12818376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl","html_url":"https://github.com/gregvanl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291057332,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/verified","name":"verified","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-12-01T18:51:00Z","updated_at":"2016-12-07T16:49:23Z","closed_at":"2016-12-01T20:59:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- VSCode Version:1.7.2 \r\n- OS Version: Windows\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

for #15155:\r\n\r\n- [x] Windows - @seanmcbreen\r\n- [x] OS X -  @cdias\r\n- [x] Linux - @bgashler1 \r\n\r\nComplexity: 4\r\n\r\nIn order to support scenarios where extensions contribute viewlets to the activity bar, some work was done to enable scalability in the activity bar.\r\n\r\n**Setup:**\r\n* get https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/tree-explorer-sample\r\n* npm install\r\n* run it from VS Code as extension\r\n\r\n**Verify**\r\n* you can show the contributed viewlet by \r\n   * using the new `View > Additional Viewlets` entry\r\n   * right clicking on empty space in activity bar and selecting it\r\n   * by using the new view picker (quick open -> type \"`view `\" with a trailing space)\r\n* if you make the window small enough, viewlets that do not fit the space move into a new \"...\" overflow menu\r\n   * entries in the overflow menu still indicate activity as decoration to their label\r\n   * the current active viewlet is indicated in the overflow menu if inside\r\n* you can move viewlets around via DND and the position is remembered between restarts\r\n* you can remove viewlets from the activity bar and bring them back by\r\n   * unchecking them from the activity bar context menu\r\n   * right clicking on the viewlet and pick the related action to remove\r\n   * removed viewlets still show up at the end of all viewlets when they are active but hide once another viewlet opens\r\n* you can bring back a removed viewlet either by \r\n   * using the context menu on the empty space of activity bar\r\n   * by opening it and from the context menu select the related entry to keep it\r\n\r\nVerify some corner cases where you combine:\r\n* overflow of viewlets so you see the \"...\"\r\n* reordering of viewlets\r\n* keeping/removing viewlets\r\n\r\nWatch out for crashes in the console in that case, there may well be some layouting bugs 👍
