have the following code in [`modelServiceImpl`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/editor/common/services/modelServiceImpl.ts#L270):\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\npublic getCreationOptions(language: string): editorCommon.ITextModelCreationOptions {\r\n\tlet creationOptions = this._modelCreationOptionsByLanguage[language];\r\n\tif (!creationOptions) {\r\n\t\tcreationOptions = ModelServiceImpl._readModelOptions(this._configurationService.getConfiguration(null, { overrideIdentifier: language })); // TODO\r\n\t\tthis._modelCreationOptionsByLanguage[language] = creationOptions;\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn creationOptions;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code currently does not account for folder specific settings, so it seems like when a model is created, potentially wrong options are passed in. The options are:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport interface ITextModelCreationOptions {\r\n\ttabSize: number;\r\n\tinsertSpaces: boolean;\r\n\tdetectIndentation: boolean;\r\n\ttrimAutoWhitespace: boolean;\r\n\tdefaultEOL: DefaultEndOfLine;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code needs to change in a way that it takes the model resource into account, if it is a file resource. That probably means that we can no longer cache the model creation options, or need a new cache that is multi root aware.\r\n\r\nThis will enable the `files.eol` setting as a folder setting 👍
