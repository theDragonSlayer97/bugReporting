This plugin is very good, because it improves IntelliSense and we don't need to use `.ts` files to have improved IntelliSense, but the problem is, it somehow duplicates suggestions and some of them arranges to the end or at the middle which is really bad, but still is it better to have this with improved IntelliSense. I know `Flow` and `TypeScript` not the best friends since VS Code using `TypeScript` it makes zero sense to you for trying to fix it, but it will be very cool from your side.\r\n\r\nP.S. If someone are lazy to check issue on `Flow` plugin which is above I can post here all the content from the issue I opened.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24973","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24973/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24973/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24973/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/24973","id":222529366,"number":24973,"title":"Fix #24971.

VSCode Version: 1.11.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10  (Version 1703), with WSL enabled.\r\n\r\nI use Bash On Ubuntu On Windows, and I try to make it my default terminal in VSCode. In my `User Settings` :\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"terminal.integrated.shell.windows\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\sysnative\\\\bash.exe\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is a Node application written in TypeScript. I use Gulp to run tasks and it works well if I use the terminal directly. But now I try to make `CTRL-SHIFT-B` run the build command task, which has to call \"`node_modules/.bin/gulp compile`\" to run the transpilation from TypeScript to Javascript.\r\n\r\nThanks to [this thread](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6579), I'm able to at least start the compilation with this `tasks.json` file :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n    \"command\": \"node_modules/.bin/gulp\",\r\n    \"isShellCommand\": true,\r\n    \"suppressTaskName\": true,\r\n    \"tasks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"taskName\": \"tsc\",\r\n            \"args\": [\r\n                \"compile\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"isBuildCommand\": true,\r\n            \"problemMatcher\": \"$tsc\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe compilation starts but _fails_ because it involves the `oracledb` library which needs some environment variables to be set :\r\n```\r\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/oracle/instantclient:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\r\nexport OCI_LIB_DIR=/usr/local/oracle/instantclient\r\nexport OCI_INC_DIR=/usr/local/oracle/instantclient/sdk/include\r\n```\r\nWhen I run `env` directly in the terminal, I see those variables since they are exported in my `~/.bashrc` file, and this is why the direct compilation works. But when the compilation is ran from the task, those variable are not set, for some reason!\r\n\r\n1) How can I make the task to automatically source my `~\\.bashrc` file? Or should I define the exports in another file for them to work?\r\n\r\n2) At the end of the task, a \"_Press any key to close the terminal_\" message is displayed. Is there a way to output the task to the \"output\" console instead? Or at least is it possible to remove the requirement to press a key at the end? I'd prefere to not have to do that each time I build using `CTRL-SHIFT-B`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24966","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24966/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24966/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24966/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24966","id":222495988,"number":24966,"title":"PowerShell
