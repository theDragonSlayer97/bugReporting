recently noticed a bug where the visible editing cursor and selection are offset to where VSCode thinks the cursor is. This happens when zooming in and seems to be dependent on the font you are using.\r\n\r\nThe bug happens for me when using the [Hack Font](http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) under Linux. Using that font under Windows did not result in an offset of the cursor / selection. Using *Ubuntu Mono* as my font did not trigger the bug, nor was increment the font size instead of zooming.\r\n\r\nThe following pictures illustrate the issue:\r\n\r\nCorrect selection using *Ubuntu Mono*:\\\r\n![no_offset_far_right](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/328798/25779056/b3b85de2-330f-11e7-8043-e1471577ba4b.png)\r\n\r\nOffset selection using *Hack*:\\\r\n![offset_far_right](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/328798/25779057/b8b104de-330f-11e7-87bd-31790e2222c6.png)\r\n\r\nIn both cases `node.getRight()` has been selected and hitting backspace will delete it.\r\n\r\nThis also happens around the 80 column mark, not just far to the right, note the cursor ontop of the equal sign:\\\r\n![offset](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/328798/25779077/58445bf4-3310-11e7-996d-e100be8ea3b0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.12.1\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

Open a JavaScript file\r\n2. Remove or comment out the declaration of a variable.\r\n3. (Optional) Add a statement to initialize the variable without declaring it (so it's global).\r\n4. Attempt to rename that variable by clicking one of its usages and pressing F2.\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior:  All usages of the variable are renamed to the new name, or a helpful error message is shown to explain why it can't be done.\r\n\r\nActual Behavior:  Receive the error \"You cannot rename this element.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that removing the declaration of a variable prevents it from being renamed via any of its later usages in the file.  This happens even if the variable is assigned a value and becomes a global.  I have two questions about this behavior, which is why I am opening this issue.\r\n\r\n1. Is this expected, reasonable behavior?  The example below is still valid JavaScript and runs with NodeJS.  I don't often use global variables--this is just an example.\r\n2. If the behavior is expected, then can the feedback for the user be improved?  The current message \"You cannot rename this element.\" isn't helpful.\r\n\r\nHere is an example that demonstrates the issue:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Here I am, cleaning up an old messy JavaScript file that I probably wrote.\r\n// For whatever reason, I comment out / delete the original variable declarations first.\r\n// var oldLongGrossName = process.env.SOME_ARCHAIC_ENV_VAR;\r\n\r\n// The old code might be assigning a value to the variable\r\n// without declaring it first (so it's a global).  It doesn't matter for this issue.\r\noldLongGrossName = 'm_somethingBtnWndow_lol';\r\n\r\n// Then I set up new variable(s) somewhere else, maybe using a config file\r\n// or command line arguments.\r\nvar betterName = 'something';\r\n\r\n// Now I click 'oldLongGrossName' anywhere in the file and hit F2 to try to rename\r\n// all of its occurrences to 'betterName' (or anything, it doesn't matter).\r\n// I get the following error:  \"You cannot rename this element.\"  I am befuddled.\r\nvar config = {\r\n  foo: oldLongGrossName\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Since I'm reusing this variable in several places, a global rename would be convenient.\r\nconsole.log('Probably going to log something about ' + oldLongGrossName);\r\n\r\n// So convenient...\r\nvar fancyDerivedName = oldLongGrossName + '.txt';\r\n```\r\nRight now the only way I can see to get this to work is to resurrect / create a declaration for the variable, do the rename, and then delete the variable declaration.  A search and replace would work too, I suppose.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can provide more information or be helpful in some

caret around (clicking to new position seems to increase how often this will happen, though it'll occur when using the arrow keys too).\r\n\r\nWhen caret does not move to the clicked position, use an arrow key and observe that the caret position is rendered relative to where last clicked (even though it did not visually move there).\r\n\r\nE.g. occasionally the caret will (after some delay) jump one character left or right of where I click (after manually hitting an arrow key).\r\n![out](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3288888/25775852/bcead868-32a6-11e7-99ef-c7a4e43c1831.gif)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26134","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26134/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26134/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26134/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26134","id":226800259,"number":26134,"title":"Feature

VSCode Version: 1.12.1\r\n- Chrome Version: 58.0.3029.96\r\n- OS Version: Windows10 15063.138\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Chrome and VS Code with both maximized.\r\n2. Switch to Chrome, open a web page which constantly renders 3D scene on a `<canvas>` element\r\n3. Open the Dev Tool of the Chrome, make sure the focus is on the Dev Tool (open the Console, make sure the input cursor is blinking) while not causing the render process to stop.\r\n4. Switch between VS Code and Chrome (using ALT+TAB), and there will be a great chance that the VS Code freezes for a while when switch back to it.\r\n\r\nThis problem occurs when I am trying to use VS Code to finish the assignments of my Computer Graphics course, which requires us to use JavaScript and WebGL to create 3D scene and animation.\r\n\r\nMy implementation will keep rendering even if the scene did not change at all (pretty naive, I know). When I am debugging my work, I frequently switch between Chrome and VS Code, and I noticed that VS Code would freeze for a while when I switch back to it in most of the time. Sometimes the freezing can last for over 10 seconds, so it is really annoying. Interesting to note that this freezing problem never triggered the Windows' \"not responding\" warning.\r\n\r\nI am sure this problem is triggered by the rendering process, since now I am careful enough to switch to another Chrome tab (to stop the rendering) every time before I switch back to VS Code, and the problem goes away. I tried to run VS Code without any extensions using the command `code --disable-extensions .`, but the problem is still there.\r\n\r\nYou can find my code at [here](https://github.com/Mr-Dai/CSIT5400). The repository contains two assignments, and both of them can trigger this problem on my machine.\r\n\r\nIf you need any other information, just let me know.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4230","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"E25A:22565:38AF0FB:485E359:59D936CD","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=323>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=321>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"c8662fb02a1931974200874ddaa36129\"","status":"200 OK"}}
