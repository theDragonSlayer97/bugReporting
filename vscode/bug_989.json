VSCode Version: 1.1.0-insider (1f0657703be5609d70088b0385bc27db8cc03a41)\n- OS Version: Fedora 23\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Launch vscode-insiders using the app launcher\n2. Attempt to build mozilla/gecko-dev with a vscode configuration from nwgh/gecko-vscode and zsh configuration from nwgh/homedir (this uses the \"Full Build\" task, though I suspect any task would exhibit the same behavior).\n3. While the build succeeds, the output is in an unexpected directory.\n\nLet me expand in a way that doesn't involve steps - I use the MOZCONFIG environment variable to tell the firefox build system how to build (what compiler to use, what object directory to use, config options, etc) - this environment variable points to a file that contains the instructions for the build system. When I build from the cli, or from an instance of code started from the cli, this works fine (my environment is picked up just fine). However, when I run from an instance of code started from the GNOME app launcher, my environment is not picked up at all, causing confusion.\n\nI have put minimal files that exhibit this behavior at https://gist.github.com/nwgh/c7b71148908bea753a78685ffad03210\n\nFrom that gist, `.zshrc` should go in `$HOME`, `mach` should go in some directory (call it `srcdir`), and tasks.json should go in `srcdir/.vscode`. Then, open code, open `srcdir` in code, and run the `Full Build` task.\n\nThis worked on 0.10.15-insider (my previous build on the same machine - sorry I don't have a better build to work from for bisecting).\n\nThis behavior does not happen on my mac install of the exact same version of code.\n\nFor now, I have worked around this by making my build task a shell script that invokes zsh as an interactive shell (to pick up my environment) with a script that calls the firefox build system. I could also likely work around this with os-specific properties in my tasks.json that replicates the work my shell does, or some extra layer of indirection within my mozconfig that replicates the work my shell already does (since a mozconfig is just a shell script). However, that seems... ugly, and prone to break in the future when I inevitably change something in my shell config.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6109","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6109/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6109/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6109/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/6109","id":153117004,"number":6109,"title":"fixes

It is how the user input command.\nFor example, if a user wants to switch to a git branch, he inputs >git: branch in EN locale of VSCode. (and “git branch” in command prompt)\nBut in zh-tw locale, “>git: branch” command doesn’t work, and user have to input “>git: 分支” instead.\nI believe most of the local developers won't use IME to input Chinese characters for command input.\n\nSo, I suggest we can support the command in both English and localized string (e.g. Chinese

Currently node-debug silently ignores this error and returns an empty call stack (which is not very helpful).\n\nStrangely enough fixes node-debug's code injection this problem (but we do not yet understand why).\n\nHowever there are situations in which code injection doesn't work reliably, e.g. when attaching to an already running node process. To give better feedback to the user in this situation we will have to show the error prominently in the CALL STACK view.

there,\nI'm currently looking for a way to remove the `--debug-brk` parameter passed in scripts in `launch.json` as we currently use `launch.json` to execute some gulp tasks instead of real debugging.\n\nWe are trying to achieve a VS-like build menu.\n\nHere is our `launch.json` : \n\n```\n{\n\"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n\"configurations\": [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Build Dev\",\n

}\n]\n}\n```\n\nThis currently works, but with the `--debug-brk` option passed, it takes some time to fire up the gulp task.\n\nWe are launching gulp tasks with `child_process`'s `exec` in a small nodeJS script.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6090","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6090/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6090/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6090/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6090","id":153007233,"number":6090,"title":"Markdown

StackOverflow) makes no difference to this error. Likewise changing `gulp vscode-linux-x64` to `gulp vscode-linux-x64 --max_new_space_size=16000000` makes no difference. So I suspect there is a deeper issue here. \n\nThanks for your
