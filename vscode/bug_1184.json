would be nice to have some extra events I guess. The first one I can think of is `onPreSaveTextDocument` (or `onSaveTextDocument`). One that will be invoked right before the document gets saved.\n### Use Cases\n\nThe first one I can think of is my own plugin [final-newline](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/vscode-final-newline) that will insert a final newline at the end of the file when the user saves the document. At the moment it is implemented like this: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> → `Save` → `Insert newline` (if necessary) → `Save`\nThat last save triggers a new iteration of my plugin which will detect a final newline is already present and will stop the execution. So my loop is triggered twice because the plugin is triggered after the document was saved instead of before.\n\nI think there will be other file manipulation plugins that want to manipulate the file before it gets saved as well.\n\nFrom Alex:\n\nI agree some sort of onBeforeSave action is indeed needed, we just need more thinking regarding how to expose this without causing any data loss. If we block the save to wait on extensions, I can imagine it possible that the wait could be indefinite, resulting in data loss. Maybe a time ceiling of 10s, after which the file gets saved...\n\n@bpasero What do you

not sure if this is the right place to file this kind of bug. I remove it when it's wrong here.\n\nI encountered a strange bug today using 0.10.0. I opened a huge project folder in VSCode and tried to open a subfolder via the navigation bar on the left. The triangle icon changed like the folder has been expanded but no files and subfolders appeared in the list. Even restarting VSCode didn't solve the problem.\nThe subfolder contains more than 1000 files and its subfolders contain more than 3000 files.\n\nI use VSCode as my default editor in a huge project so I open the project folder in VSCode everyday and edit the files. After a while the \"WORKING FILES\" section in the navigation bar contained far more than 100 files from within that specific subfolder. After clearing that list and restarting VSCode I could open all the subfolders again.
