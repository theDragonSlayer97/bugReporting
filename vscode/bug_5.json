Then you can edit the files with the  client,  build and test on the remote server with all plugins running on the remote server. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nYou have a big project that will take lots of time to build and tests on your laptop, but much faster on on powerful Linux Server which do not have a screen.  For now you can only install VSCode on the Server and using ssh -x to login onto the remote server. This is solution is not satisfactory for the amount of data to transfer between X11 client and Server is too large. The developing experience is dreadful. \r\n\r\nIf there is a VSCode client and a Headless VSCode Server,  the amount of data required to transfer between client and sever will be much less. I think the editor will be much more responsive, and the speed of development will faster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions:
