The blue boxes should be vertically centerline aligned.\n2. The bold font is too dense and hard to read particularly as the contrast between the foreground and the background color is muted and thus the text looks blurred. Setting the font-weight to normal and using `letter-spacing` of around `0.04em` improves readability.\n3. The keyboard shortcuts on the right are then still hard to parse. Putting them in a  `span` and using a `letter-spacing` of `0.15em` (or `0.1em`) and a left and right padding of `0.5em` improves this.\n\nThis is what it looks like with  the changes proposed in 2.

VSCode Version: 1.5.3\n- OS Version: OSX 10.10.5\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nCreate an extension command that runs the following code:\n\n```\nlet disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('myExt.testCommand', function() {\n\n    // Get active text editor\n    let textEditor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;\n\n    // Ignore if no active TextEditor\n    if (typeof(textEditor) === 'undefined') {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    // Print out the current selections in the document\n    console.log(textEditor.selections);\n\n    let text = \"helloworld\";\n\n    // Create an edit to insert into the document\n    let edits = [\n      vscode.TextEdit.insert(textEditor.selection.active, text)\n    ];\n\n    // Insert the text\n    let uri = textEditor.document.uri;\n    let edit = new vscode.WorkspaceEdit();\n    edit.set(uri, edits);\n    vscode.workspace.applyEdit(edit);\n\n    // Once again, print out the current selections\n    console.log(textEditor.selections);\n\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\nSo essentially this code, prints out your current selections to the debug console, then inserts some text where the primary/active cursor is, then again, prints out your current selections.\n\nWhat you will find is that the differences between the 2 selections that get printed to the debug console are exactly the same even though your selections have changed. When you `.insert()` text into the document, that text is then automatically selected. \n\nFor example if you run this command, `helloworld` is inserted into the document. Then if you immediately type a letter or backspace or whatever, `helloworld` is replaced with whatever you typed, just as if `helloworld` was selected already (like if you selected it using your mouse). The bug is that your inserted text is selected, but it doesn't appear to immediately appear as part of `TextEditor.selections`.\n\nSorry if this is a bit confusing. I assume this is a bug. Can anyone confirm or deny this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4600","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"9331:366F:CA7EA2:18B82BE:59D940C7","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=763>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=761>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"c939b0681a3e6420874f792e84fcf0f3\"","status":"200 OK"}}
