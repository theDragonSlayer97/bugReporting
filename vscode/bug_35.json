I am not sure if this is the right repo to place this issue, so please guide me if not.\r\n2. I searched stackoverflow and existing issues and found nothing for it.\r\n\r\nI was trying to find a way to make `dynamic imports` or `non-static imports` to provide intellisense. For example\r\n\r\nI have a file called `user.js` with following contents\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = function () {\r\n  return {\r\n    username: 'virk'\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd another file called `index.js` with following contents\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar userModule = './user'\r\n\r\nconst user = require(userModule)()\r\nconsole.log(user)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen typing `user.` I get no intellisense, since the engine behind autocomplete may not have access to the `userModule` value and hence it fails.\r\n\r\n## Hey that's not the right way?\r\nMaybe you are right, but going there can be so many use cases where the require statements receives a dynamic value, which is part currently running application.\r\n\r\nAlso going forward, ES6 will have a [Loader](https://whatwg.github.io/loader/) API, where you can register modules or even can define a custom loader for a given application and I do think that intellisense will fail in that case too.\r\n\r\n## No offense\r\nThe above points may have nothing to do with intellisense at all, since the design behind the entire system works on static analysis.\r\n\r\nBut the reason I created the issue, since I know that a `TSServer` runs inside a separate process to provide Typescript intellisense, which means there can be other ways too to use a loader which is part of a certain application.\r\n\r\nThanks 😄

@alexandrudima \r\n- [x] macOS  - @auchenberg \r\n\r\nComplexity: 3\r\n\r\nWe enabled support to show commands (with either icon or label) in the macOS touch bar. The commands are context aware and registered per window (switching windows will update the touch bar).\r\n\r\n**Built-in**\r\n* verify out of the box you get touch bar entries that you can use\r\n* verify the debug touch bar behaves properly depending on your debug state (running, not running, stopped) and all commands work\r\n\r\n**Extensions**\r\nExtensions can add new commands via the menu API by registering to the `touchBar` location:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"contributes\": {\r\n\t\"menus\": {\r\n\t\t\"touchBar\": [\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\"command\": \"markdown.showPreview\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"when\": \"editorLangId == markdown\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"group\": \"navigation\"\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t]\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nVerify you can register commands to the touch bar and then `when` condition is respected. The touch bar will always take the context of the active editor to resolve the commands. The resource of the active editor will be passed to the command you register as context. \r\n\r\n**Note:** your command can either have a label or icon. If you chose an icon, make sure to use PNG, as SVG is currently not supported.

This means that the origin of the console use from the extension is lost. We now preserve the origin and allow access to it.\r\n\r\nUse `console.log`, `console.warn` or `console.error` from your extension with strings, objects, primitives etc. Have some extension repository and verify:\r\n* you can expand the message in the extension host dev tools to see the full stack of where the message was sent\r\n* you see the location of the message in the right hand side of the debug console and can click on it\r\n* the data that you log is not shown up in a bad way or is lost\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34755","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34755/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34755/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34755/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34755","id":259503295,"number":34755,"title":"Disable
