Can we change the behaviour when dragging a file tab out of the VSCode window that it automatically creates a new window and opens the file in there, and removes the tab from the original window? This is the behaviour in sublime, and it is very nice to be able to just drag a tab out to another monitor and continue coding.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which is similar, if you already have another window of VSCode open, and you drag a tab over to the other window it creates two instances of the open file, which is a problem because you can lose track which one you were using if you have many files/windows/tabs open. Changing the behaviour that dragging a tab over to another window closes the original tab reduces confusion. \r\n\r\nCan we make this default? If not, how would I go about changing it myself?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31753","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31753/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31753/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31753/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31753","id":246705261,"number":31753,"title":"Colour
