Assume that VSCode got built into p:\\mseng\\vscode\\VSCode-win32\n- clone the VSO git repository mshttps://monacotools.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Monaco/_git/MonacoLocalization\n- cd to the MonacoLocalization directory and run npm install\n- cd to lib, run npm install and cd to parent\n- make sure you have gulp install globally\n- run gulp import --component vscode/src --locData ${vscode-build}\\resources\\app\\out\\nls.metadata.json where ${vscode-build} is the folder vscode got built into (e.g. p:\\mseng\\vscode\\VSCode-win32)\n- ensure that some lcg and lci files got modified and added. Compare some of them. Modified files should contain new strings introduced lately, new files correspond to new files introduced lately.\n### Export bundles from the translation database\n- from the MonacoLocalization directory execute gulp export --component vscode/src --locData ${vscode-build}\\resources\\app\\out\\nls.metadata.json --dest ${vscode-build}\\resources\\app\\out\n- ensure that ${vscode-build}\\resources\\app\\out\\vs\\workbench contains files like workbench.main.nls.de.js\n## Translated Version\n- start the VSCode version you have built above with --locale=de\n- ensure that parts of the UI is in German (parts of the UI is still English because we are mssing the corresponding translations from the translation team)\n- switch your OS locale to German and start VSCode without the --locale command line parameter. Ensure that the UI is partly German\n- start VSCode with --locale=de-DE.

[x] win @alexandrudima \n- [x] os x @weinand \n- [x] linux @isidorn \n\nGeneral information about salsa can be found in Microsoft/TypeScript#4789.\nInformation about what will be new in [TS 1.8](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-wiki/blob/editing-1.8/What's-new-in-TypeScript.md).\n## Differences between Salsa and the current JS language service\n\nThese are the differences as we currently understand them.\n- The JS source level is always ES6 when using Salsa, the `target` attribute inside `jsconfig.json` file defines the target for down level compilation. \n- Salsa doesn't support the linting options that we had as `javascript.validate.lint.*` (In TS 1.8 TS will support detecting unreachable code and implicit returns). The `javascript.validate.lint.*` options are no longer supported. The recommendation is to install the [eslint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) if you want to get linting.\n- The current JS support implicitly excludes the following folders from the project: .git, node_modules, bower_components, jspm_packages,tmp, and temp. With Salsa you have to exclude them explicitly using the `excludes` property in the jsconfig.json file (waiting for confirmation from the Salsa team).\n- Salsa doesn't support the AMD module system.\n- It didn't make it into TS 1.8, but Salsa plans to acquire .d.ts automatically for the user.\n## Enabling Salsa\n- Set the environment variable `CODE_TSJS`. On OS X it is recommended to change this in the `.bash_profile` using `export CODE_TSJS=1`, then the environment variable isn't \"lost\".\n- _until Code isn't on TypeScript 1.8beta_ set `typescript.tsdk` to point to the path of the lib folder of the `typescript` module installed with `npm install typescript@next`. Alternatively, you can also install a typescript@next version inside your test work space directly.\n## Testing the Salsa enablement\n- Verify that when Salsa is enabled you get a salsa status indicator when editing JS files in the bottom right corner. The used TypeScript installation is shown in the hover.\n  ![salsa](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/172399/12555169/1e9d5a8c-c380-11e5-9252-7440fa50b9c2.png)\n- Verify that when `CODE_TSJS` is set but the used Typescript version is not `typescript@next` the salsa status indicator shows an error state.\n## Testing Code's JavaScript support powered by Salsa\n\nSee also Microsoft/TypeScript#4793 for information related to the expected developer experience.\n\nTest the Code features below in an exploratory style for the features described below.\n- Hovers (simple, definition <kbd>CMD</kbd>)\n- Mark occurrences\n- Intellisense\n- Parameter hints, signature help\n- Go to definition\n- Rename symbol\n- Format on type (enabled using `editor.formatOnType:true`)\n- Format Document\n- Format Selection/Range\n- Quick outline (<kbd>CMD+SHIFT+O</kbd>)\n- Show all symbols (<kbd>CMD+T</kbd>)\n- Validation - Salsa flags syntax errors and type errors like duplicate identifiers. Salsa doesn't perform linting.\n### Project setup support\n\nSalsa supports a `jsconfig.json` configuration file. It also supports `tsconfig.json`, to enable JavaScript for the project using a `tsconfig.json` you have to set `allowJs: true`. This enables to open up existing TS  projects for JS.\n- Verify that salsa works without a `jsconfig.json` (the module property is not defined in this case)\n- Verify that salsa works with a `jsconfig.json` (the `module` property defaults to `commonjs`). \n### Intellisense support:\n\nSalsa shows first the list of inferred proposals first and then all global identifiers found in the project. \n- verify that the inferred proposals are visually distinct from the global identifiers.\n### Modules, cross file dependencies\n\nSalsa support commonjs modules and dependencies expressed using /// references\n- Verify that salsa supports commonjs modules\n- Verify that Salsa supports /// references\n\n``` javascript\n/// <reference path=\"ref.js\" />\n```\n- Verify that Intellisense works across files/modules\n- Verify that goto definition works across files/modules\n- Verify that the rename refactoring works across files/modules\n- Verify that reference searching works across files/modules\n### Typings/.d.ts files\n\nSalsa understands .d.ts files that installed inside the project and that are part of the project context.\n- Verify that .d.ts files installed with `tsd` works\n- Verify that .d.ts files bundled with node modules work.\n### Classes\n\nSalsa supports ES3 and ES6 style classes\n- Verify that Salsa supports Intellisense for ES3 style classes and their properties and methods.\n\n``` javascript\nfunction Person(name, age) {\n    this.name = name;\n}\n\nPerson.prototype.getName = function getName() {\n  return this.name;\n};\n```\n- Verify that Salsa supports Intellisense for ES6 style classes and their properties and methods.\n\n``` javascript\nclass Book {\n  constructor(title) {\n    this.title = title;\n  }\n  get title() {\n    return this.title;\n  }\n}\n```\n### JSDoc support\n\nSalsa supports JSDoc.\n- Verify that the JSDoc information is honoured for Intellisense, parameter hints.\n\n``` javascript\n/**\n * A person\n * @constructor\n * @param {string} name - The name of the person.\n * @param {number} age - The age of the person.\n */\nfunction Person(name, age) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.age = age;\n}\n```\n### Settings\n\nSalsa doesn't support the existing `javascript.validate.lint.*` settings. \n- Verify that are should no longer shown to user when Salsa is active.\n### React/JSX\n\nSalsa supports JSX. To get Intellisense for React install the typings for `react-global` using `tsd install react-global`.\n\n``` JavaScript\nvar CommentBox = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"commentBox\">\n        Hello, world! I am a CommentBox.\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <CommentBox />,\n  document.getElementById('content')\n);\n```\n- Verify that you get Intellisense inside the JSX constructs.\n\n`tsc` supports to translate `.jsx` files to .js files by defining the `jsx` property inside the jsconfig.json (:warning: currently tsc only honours `tsconfig.json` files).\n\n``` javascript\n \"jsx\": \"react\",\n```\n- Verify that you can translate .jsx files\n### ReactNative\n\n:warning: Not yet supported in `1.8.0-dev.20160125`\nSalsa supports ReactNative, where the JSX constructs are used inside normal .js files.\n- Verify that you do not get syntax errors inside .js file when using .jsx constructs.\n- Verify that you get Intellisense inside JSX constructs.\n### Down level compilation\n\nSalsa supports to down compile ES6 to ES5, ES3, etc. You can define the `target` and `outDir` attribute inside the jsconfig.json. :warning: currently only supported inside a `tsconfig.json` that includes `allowJs:true`. As a workaround you can use `tsc -p jsconfig.json`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2217","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2217/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2217/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2217/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2217","id":128485964,"number":2217,"title":"Some
