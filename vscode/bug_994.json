Sorry if this isn’t the right place.\n\nSo my question is about how extensions could provide language support (autocompletion, linter, syntax highlighting, snippets, etc.) for tagged ES6 template strings?

I also find it funny that `IMarker` is defined as `message:string` and we check if `Array.isArray(marker.message)` in there.\n\nI have added a check on my side, but IMHO we should not have such markers in our system since they are useless or represent a bug somewhere else.

Plenty of times I have accidentally edited a transpiled file, wondering why my changes did get updated.\n\nAs an aside, file type icons would be cool, as well.

@seva0stapenko\n\n---\n\nTried column selection in VSCode 1.0. Well, rectangular selection does work, cutting and pasting back also works, but that's about it.\nCutting and pasting into a different part of the code does not work as expected. Both Notepad++ and VS remember that copied text was a rectangular block and paste it as a rectangular block.\nVSCode treats copied block just like a regular text, so pasting it anywhere outside of the current multi-cursor context would create a mess.\nIt's good that the feature is being worked on, but it's not fully baked yet.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5940/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5938","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5938/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5938/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5938/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5938","id":151596702,"number":5938,"title":"'Unnecessary using directive' is falsely flagged when required for XML cref comments.","user":{"login":"lake-fall","id":10201888,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10201888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lake-fall","html_url":"https://github.com/lake-fall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lake-fall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lake-fall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lake-fall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lake-fall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lake-fall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lake-fall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lake-fall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lake-fall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lake-fall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-28T09:55:20Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T12:55:45Z","closed_at":"2016-04-28T12:55:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.0.0\n- OS Version: WIndows 10 Version 1511\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
