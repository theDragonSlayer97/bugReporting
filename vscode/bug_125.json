To return to a single cursor state with the find window closed I usually hit escape 5 or 6 times in sequence. In regular mode this is not an issue, in Zen mode this drops me out of zen mode entirely. Can we get an option to disable the \"escape zen mode\" keyboard shortcut? I feel leaving Zen mode should be a more deliberate action.\r\n\r\nIn addition while I'm editting in VSCode in Zen mode, I may have multiple files open in the same tab. Eventually I get to a point where I feel comfortable closing out all of those files and starting from a clean slate. In this case I'll rapidly hit Ctrl+W and watch the files disappear, however unexpectedly when I hit Ctrl+W with no tabs open VSCode shutsdown entirely. I don't know of any other program that does this, except for maybe chrome where no tabs = no program. I feel this should be rectified entirely (not just hidden behind an option).\r\n\r\nVSCode is awesome, thanks so much for building and maintaining it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32075/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32074","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32074/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32074/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32074/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/32074","id":248297360,"number":32074,"title":"SimpleFindWidget

Notice that toggled line is not properly aligned (there is an unwanted space before the opening `<p>` tag and after the closing `</p>` tag).\r\n\r\n   ```html\r\n   <div>\r\n     <p>Line 1</p>\r\n      <p>Line 2</p> \r\n   <div>\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   To further demonstrate the issue, repeatedly toggle the line comment on/off. Below is the result of toggling the same line on/off ten times.\r\n\r\n   ```html\r\n   <div>\r\n     <p>Line 1</p>\r\n              <!-- <p>Line 2</p>          -->\r\n   <div>\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   Multi-line comments are also affected. Below is the result of toggling the entire block of HTML on/off ten times:\r\n\r\n   ```html\r\n            <!-- <div>\r\n     <p>Line 1</p>\r\n     <p>Line 2</p>\r\n   <div>          -->   ```\r\n\r\nI believe the expected behavior is for a toggled comment to restore the line's original alignment much like other toggled comments do. It appears that the issue is caused by space characters that are added when commenting (`<!--[SPACE]` and `[SPACE]-->`) which are not removed when uncommenting (only `<!--` and `-->` are removed).\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions:

Install an update or new version of VS Code.\r\n2. Observe system CPU usage and how long the installer takes.\r\n\r\nVS Code's Windows installer appears to be CPU-bound. The installer has to copy a large number of small files (particularly in node_modules). It also appears to update a string in the UI with the name of the current file being copied. Text layout and rendering is a CPU-expensive operation, and the CPU overhead of updating the UI string with the current filename can be larger than the actual time it takes to copy the file. Therefore installation time is mainly bound on how quickly the system can layout and render text, rather than I/O performance. This is the same reason modern versions of Windows throttle the updates when copying files to ~4 times a second, since it helps achieve better throughput with fast storage.\r\n\r\nI would guess VS Code's installer could be a lot faster if it did the same kind of throttling, and that would be nice to make update prompts less inconvenient.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32067/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32066","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32066/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32066/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32066/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32066","id":248251300,"number":32066,"title":"Setting to Open VSCode with Open Editors Closed","user":{"login":"rbiggs","id":249218,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/249218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs","html_url":"https://github.com/rbiggs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":421131022,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/as-designed","name":"as-designed","color":"E2A1C2","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-08-06T14:44:11Z","updated_at":"2017-08-09T04:02:36Z","closed_at":"2017-08-07T21:04:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"By default, when you open a project in VSCode it always has the Open Editors tab open in the side column.
