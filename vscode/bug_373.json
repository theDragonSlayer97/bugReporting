Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.12-insider\r\n- OS Version: 66546c\r\n\r\nI was editing some code, and at some point in time, the cursor became a weird symbol - an arrow with a plus at it's top-right. I inspected, and it's coming from: \r\n\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.monaco-editor.hc-black.mac.mouse-copy .view-lines, .monaco-editor.mouse-copy .view-lines, .monaco-editor.vs-dark.mac.mouse-copy .view-lines {\r\n  cursor: copy\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwith the `.monaco-editor.mouse-copy .view-lines` being the active class.\r\n\r\nI don't understand how the editor went into that state. When I open a new file, the normal `text` cursor shows up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24602/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24601","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24601/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24601/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24601/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24601","id":221274213,"number":24601,"title":"Have a setting to prevent auto trim whitespace on cursor line","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-04-12T14:06:39Z","updated_at":"2017-04-19T10:54:21Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Add an option to **prevent** **auto trim** whitespace from acting on the **cursor line**.\r\nIt is very annoying when I change focus in the middle of typing something and switch back and see my inserted space behind the cursor is gone and I have to hit space again.\r\nhint: _Atom_ has this feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24601/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24600","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24600/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24600/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24600/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24600","id":221272024,"number":24600,"title":"Markdown preview -

If I open a file created elsewhere (project generator created files for example) that have tab indentation of 4, I would expect to be able to just hit **SHIFT-ALT F** to format that document and have my tab settings applied. This does not happen. I have to go to the tab size indicator in VS Codes status bar, click on that and select **'Indent Using Spaces'** and then click on **'2 Configured Tab Size'**.\r\n\r\nThis then allows me to use SHIFT-ALT F to apply my preferred tab sizes to most file types but, confusingly, this does not seem to work for **.cshtml** files, which seem to insist on retaining whatever tab size they were created with.\r\n\r\nIs this intended behaviour?\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: Code 1.11.1 (d9484d12b38879b7f4cdd1150efeb2fd2c1fbf39, 2017-04-06T13:58:12.954Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.15063\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|html-snippets|abusaidm|0.1.0|\r\n|azuretoolsforvscode|bradygaster|1.2.1|\r\n|vscode-eslint|dbaeumer|1.2.8|\r\n|vscode-babel-coloring|dzannotti|0.0.4|\r\n|vscode-npm-script|eg2|0.1.9|\r\n|azure-iot-toolkit|formulahendry|0.0.11|\r\n|CppSnippets|hars|0.0.7|\r\n|beautify|HookyQR|1.0.2|\r\n|rest-client|humao|0.14.1|\r\n|csharpextensions|jchannon|1.3.0|\r\n|vscode-nuget-package-manager|jmrog|1.1.2|\r\n|Angular2|johnpapa|2.2.3|\r\n|vscode-extension-auto-import|moppitz|1.3.3|\r\n|mssql|ms-mssql|0.3.0|\r\n|cpptools|ms-vscode|0.10.5|\r\n|csharp|ms-vscode|1.8.1|\r\n|PowerShell|ms-vscode|0.12.2|\r\n|vscode-azureextensionpack|ms-vscode|0.0.4|\r\n|team|ms-vsts|1.115.0|\r\n|azurerm-vscode-tools|msazurermtools|0.3.4|\r\n|vscode-docker|PeterJausovec|0.0.13|\r\n|view-in-browser|qinjia|0.0.5|\r\n|vscode-icons|robertohuertasm|7.5.1|\r\n|yo|samverschueren|0.9.3|\r\n|aspnet-helper|schneiderpat|0.6.3|\r\n|vscode-gulp|tanato|0.0.4|\r\n|usql-vscode-ext|usqlextpublisher|0.1.13|\r\n|application-insights|VisualStudioOnlineApplicationInsights|0.4.1|\r\n|bootstrap-3-snippets|wcwhitehead|0.0.9|\r\n|wilderminds-aspnetcore-snippets|wilderminds|0.2.1|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. \r\n2.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24593","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24593/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24593/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24593/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24593","id":221246571,"number":24593,"title":"Intellisense should not show entries that are the same as already typed text","user":{"login":"CoenraadS","id":5593825,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5593825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoenraadS","html_url":"https://github.com/CoenraadS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoenraadS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoenraadS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoenraadS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoenraadS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoenraadS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoenraadS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoenraadS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoenraadS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoenraadS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-12T12:31:05Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T12:46:00Z","closed_at":"2017-04-12T12:46:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.12.0-insider (66546c13343f71e3055ce4866d994223f0a811ac, 2017-04-12T06:11:15.687Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|ng-template|Angular|0.1.3|\r\n|path-intellisense|christian-kohler|1.2.0|\r\n|bracket-pair-colorizer|CoenraadS|0.9.0|\r\n|angular-productivity-pack|devboosts|1.2.1|\r\n|githistory|donjayamanne|0.2.0|\r\n|EditorConfig|EditorConfig|0.9.3|\r\n|tslint|eg2|0.11.0|\r\n|auto-rename-tag|formulahendry|0.0.11|\r\n|angular2-switcher|infinity1207|0.1.4|\r\n|vscode-angular2-emmet|jakethashi|1.0.11|\r\n|Angular-BeastCode|Mikael|4.0.7|\r\n|debugger-for-chrome|msjsdiag|2.7.3|\r\n|angular2-inline|natewallace|0.0.17|\r\n|vscode-html-scss|P-de-Jong|0.0.42|\r\n|better-merge|pprice|0.6.0|\r\n|vscode-css-peek|pranaygp|1.2.4|\r\n|vscode-icons|robertohuertasm|7.5.1|\r\n|annotator|ryu1kn|0.10.1|\r\n|html-css-class-completion|Zignd|1.0.3|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
