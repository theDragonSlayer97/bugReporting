I'm writing a book that uses HTML as the base format. I'll type something like so:\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    My name is Ray.\r\n\r\nAnd when I hit the period for the end of the sentence, Emmet tries to autocomplete it. Since I'm hitting enter to add a newline for the closing paragraph tag, this ends up converting it to something like <Ray class=\"\"></Ray>. I tried disabling the 'auto complete on enter' setting, but that messed with my snippets and muscle memory. Frankly, I just don't want to use Emmet.
