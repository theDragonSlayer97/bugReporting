Hit Shift-F5 or the Stop Debugging button to detach the debugger and terminate the node program.\n   Expected behavior: The debugger detaches and vscode exits debug mode.\n   **Actual behavior: Nothing happens for about 10 seconds, then vscode crashes.**\n\n_Possible clue_ \nIf vscode was launched from the command line with \n`code`\n(see the shell command setup here https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)\nThen step 7 produces the following output in the debug console, and vscode does not crash.\n\n```\n/usr/local/Cellar/node/6.7.0/bin/node[57339]:

business, however I fear that this comes at the cost of spam: you will see many model content change events while the user is typing, so basically each key press will trigger this event. Performance should always be something to be concerned of, especially when it is typing performance we are talking about.\r\n> \r\n> Some ideas:\r\n> \r\n> buffer the model content change event and only start to emit the change after a certain delay\r\n> do not always create an event object to send around\r\n> I think buffering would be a good idea anyway because backups should also not be created without some delay.\r\n\r\nFrom @bpasero  in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/14115#discussion_r87146511\r\n\r\n> @Tyriar I do not see a reason to create an object here each time a character is typed. the untitled event just sends around its resource URI and I would do the same thing here for files.\r\n>\r\n> Cannot say it often enough, this model content change event WILL FIRE like CRAZY.

Double click the `Visual Studio Code - Insiders.app` in the Applications folder to start the app per usual.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe application opens and I can edit files.\n\nActual Behavior:\nThe application immediately closes without warning or displaying an error.\n\nAttempted remediation steps:\n1. Reinstalling the application has no effect\n2. I have removed the directories `~/Library/Caches/com.microsoft.VSCodeInsiders` and `~/Library/Caches/com.microsoft.VSCodeInsiders.ShipIt`\n3. `code --disable-extensions` does not open the app\n\nNo remediation steps have had any effect. The app simply will not open.\n\nAdditional Information:\n1. The stable version runs without issue: v1.6.1\n   9e4e44c19e393803e2b05fe2323cf4ed7e36880e\n2. `code --disable-extensions --disable-gpu -w` returns almost immediately.\n3. What led to this? Honestly have no idea. I have not been working on any large projects or things that have been giving the application fits. This problem started today after running successfully for many weeks. I upgraded to macOS Sierra approximately two weeks ago without issue.

This includes:\n- Variables view updates as a focused stack frame is changed and all the variable actions work as expected\n- Watch expression view updates as a focused stack frame is changed and you can add / edit watch expressions\n- Callstack view nicely shows the callstack - at least one tester should try debugging a multi threaded program (@weinand debugged multi threaded mono program).\n- Breakpoint view - enabling, disabling, adding breakpoints works as expected\n- Floating debug action widget\n- Debug repl evaluates as excepted and you get suggestions in the debg repl input\n\nYou do not have to cover each and every of these features, just try to be creative and test as many actions as time allows.\n\nIn order to enable multi target debugging, you need to add an `composite` configuration in your `'launch.json'` as described in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13426\nVerify:\n- Multiple debug processes get started and this is properly displayed in the call stack view\n- You can switch between processes by clicking on the callstack and all the actions are performed on the selected process\n- Once a breakpoint is hit on a process that process automtically get selected\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14170","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14170/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14170/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14170/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14170","id":184518083,"number":14170,"title":"Test:

Code currently highlights something that has the language ID `php` only if it is wrapped in `<?php` tags, and everything outside like HTML. That is wrong in a few ways. The code outside of `<?php` is not \"php\" language, it is whatever output you are using. So for a CLI application, code outside would just get printed to STDOUT, while in a webserver it would get send to the client, which means the language is dependend on the `Content-Type` header (it does not have to be text/html). Only the code _inside_ `<?php` tags should be considered PHP, the outside can actually be any language, like `html` or `plaintext`. As this is not defined anywhere, VS Code should autodetect and fallback to HTML as that is most used. The inside is then \"injected\" as PHP like JavaScript in a `<script/>` tag or CSS in a `<style/>` tag. Also see #1751.\r\n\r\nThis causes many issues:\r\n1. PHP in markdown blocks don't get highlighted if they use the ```php tag and do not contain `<?php`. If you switch to preview or view the file on GitHub or any other editor, everything works fine.  \r\n   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10532611/19602026/df226f72-97ab-11e6-83d8-8867cfe52089.png)\r\n2. If you `eval()` to evaluate code (which does not require `<?php` tags) and the PHP debugger breaks inside that code, VS Code does a `sourceRequest`. The reported code does not get syntax highlighted. This means the PHP debugger [needs to dynamically add this tag](https://github.com/felixfbecker/vscode-php-debug/blob/master/src/phpDebug.ts#L589), which also means that every breakpoint request, every stackframe location [needs to be shifted one line down](https://github.com/felixfbecker/vscode-php-debug/blob/master/src/phpDebug.ts#L539).\r\n3. Like many language servers, [the PHP LS includes a declaration line in the HoverResponse](https://github.com/felixfbecker/php-language-server/pull/50). This declaration line is only colored if a `<?php` is included, which I would like to remove because it doesn't make sense: I declared the language to be PHP, so it should be highlighted as PHP. Other clients like Eclipse behave correctly here.
