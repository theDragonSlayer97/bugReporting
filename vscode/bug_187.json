This should expand to `margin-bottom: 10px`, but it does nothing.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, if I just type the `mb` part, I get intellisense for many things, apparently by searching for `m` and `b`.

`m0-5-5`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30187","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30187/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30187/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30187/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30187","id":240952515,"number":30187,"title":"Hide
