The only bindings that can be changed for column selection are as follows:\n![](http://puu.sh/pVyet/447aaf5f64.png)\n\n In other programs it's bound by default to `middle click` or `alt+drag`, but in VSCode it's bound to `alt+shift`. It's not an inherently bad thing to do bindings different than other programs, but it'd be nice if it was configurable. I'd really like to change it to `alt`, personally. [And I'm not alone, either.](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1515#issuecomment-224232517)\n\nIt's possible that it can already be rebound, but as it's not in the `Default Keyboard Shortcuts` file, there's no way for the basic user to find out that it can be rebound. This would be an even easier fix if that was the case, tho--simply add an entry for it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8992","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8992/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8992/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8992/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8992","id":164657156,"number":8992,"title":"How

master](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6569#issuecomment-222913734), it worked fine. However, now that 1.3.0 has been released, I tried again and on Windows the whole editor freezes for about 10 seconds when triggering the command that shows the list of processes as a quick pick dropdown.\n\nI reproed this on my main Windows box, however it doesn't repro on a secondary box I have. I'm not restarting my main box in case you guys need the repro machine.\n\nI took a CPU profile but it just shows `(program)` where it spent most of the time.
