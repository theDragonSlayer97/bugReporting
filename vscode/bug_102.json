the Code documentation:\r\n\r\n> All extensions when activated run in our shared extension host process. This separate process for extensions ensures that VS Code remains responsive through-out.\r\n\r\nI think that, in general, is a great approach as responsiveness is _very_ important. However, I would argue that the current model could be even better. Currently, it does not account for some use cases. In these cases serious responsiveness problems can still be encountered.\r\n\r\nI use Code together with [VSCodeVim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim). Recently I was having a problem with one of the extensions I've installed. The extension was misbehaving and using a lot of CPU. Since both VSCodeVim and the misbehaving extension was running on the same thread editing was made completely impossible.\r\n\r\nExtensions like VSCodeVim becomes their user's primary way of interacting with their editor. If the VSCodeVim extension is unresponsive due to another extension then the whole editing experience is unresponsive.\r\n\r\nI would argue that key extensions like VSCodeVim should be allowed to run on the main thread or a thread separate from the other extensions. Otherwise using extensions like VSCodeVim will always result in a less responsive and less stable editing experience.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32762","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32762/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32762/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32762/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32762","id":251168827,"number":32762,"title":"Can't make word pattern works with double ticks (for renaming)","user":{"login":"MangelMaxime","id":4760796,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4760796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MangelMaxime","html_url":"https://github.com/MangelMaxime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MangelMaxime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MangelMaxime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MangelMaxime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MangelMaxime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MangelMaxime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MangelMaxime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MangelMaxime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MangelMaxime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MangelMaxime/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":398766855,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-find-widget","name":"editor-find-widget","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-18T08:00:32Z","updated_at":"2017-08-18T08:00:36Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"In F#, we are allowed to name a variable like ` ``test`` ` (the double ticks are not an error)\r\n\r\nIn order to match this kind of variable and allowing renaming them, I created this regex:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(``((\\w*\\s?)\\s?)*``)|((\\w*')(\\w'?)*)|(-?\\d*\\.\\d\\w*)|([^\\`\\~\\!\\@\\$\\^\\&\\*\\(\\)\\=\\+\\[\\{\\]\\}\\\\\\|\\;\\:\\'\\\"\\,\\.\\<\\>\\/\\s]+)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see [here](https://regex101.com/r/laVr9h/1) it's matching the variables names as expected.
