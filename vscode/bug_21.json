Install the C++ extension.\r\n2. Open some folder with some C++ files (it might have be non-trivial).\r\n3. Debug our Microsoft.VSCode.Extension.exe and put a breakpoint in the Microsoft.VSCode.CPP.Extension.exe!message_handler::exit(void) or shutdown method.\r\n4. Close VS Code.\r\n\r\nBug: VS Code is somehow killing the Microsoft.VSCode.Extension.exe process before we can finish our required exiting steps, which causes our database to not be safety shutdown and we end up having to rebuild it unnecessarily. The process is created via the LanguageClient interface. We've been having this problem for as long as we can remember. The bug doesn't repro with our test framework that launches the Microsoft.VSCode.Extension.exe process without going through VS Code. I assume the issue is reproduceable using any language server protocol process. If I put the breakpoint earlier in the shutdown process, it will hit the breakpoint, but as soon as I step, the process exits prematurely (i.e. we never get an exit message).\r\n\r\nBy adding sleeps in our shutdown method, I see that with as little as 150 ms of sleeping is allowed before the process is killed before calling exit, although we get up to 1 second in shutdown itself -- so as a workaround for this issue, I moved our exit code to shutdown and that appears to have fixed our issue (although I need to do more testing). In other words, we can't rely on exit to be called. But it's hard to debug our shutdown code when VS Code keeps killing the process, so if you could disable that with some setting it would be helpful (I ended up just relying on logging).\r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions:

to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34868\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.17.0-insider (1.17.0-insider) (this issue does not occur in the latest stable release)\r\n- OS Version: macOS High Sierra Version 10.13 Beta (17A362a)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open VSCode Insiders.\r\n2. Use the following configuration:\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n  \"editor.fontSize\": 11,\r\n  \"editor.fontFamily\":\r\n    \"'Operator Mono', Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace\",\r\n  \"editor.wordWrap\": \"on\",\r\n  \"editor.fontLigatures\": true,\r\n  \"terminal.integrated.fontSize\": 11,\r\n  \"terminal.integrated.lineHeight\": 1.6,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Open the integrated terminal and a blank editor.\r\n4. Paste the following text into the integrated terminal and editor:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas imperdiet lectus libero, vel iaculis tortor bibendum sed. Donec blandit, massa a tristique tincidunt, justo mauris tristique lorem, sed dictum urna urna eu enim. Donec lacinia augue eget lorem viverra fermentum. Fusce lorem lacus, interdum in lorem ut, molestie lobortis quam. In et suscipit eros. Suspendisse tristique diam id condimentum mattis. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia Curae; Sed condimentum egestas nunc, a porttitor velit ornare vitae. Proin lacus ante, ornare a auctor nec, aliquam vel nibh. Mauris ac lectus a risus dictum rhoncus sit amet vel sem. Duis sed ultrices risus. Mauris ultricies elementum nisi, egestas luctus libero condimentum eget. Curabitur porta cursus lacus, ac facilisis tortor sagittis ultricies. Integer egestas posuere tellus nec iaculis. Nunc turpis ipsum, congue eu venenatis ac, viverra eu nisl.\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Compare the shape of letters in the integrated terminal and in the editor. Letter shapes in the integrated terminal appear condensed (narrower) in Insiders. In Stable, letter shapes are consistent between the integrated terminal and the editor. I think this is due to the change to rendering with canvas: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34868.\r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\n**Insiders**\r\n![insiders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3104489/30887285-99d099fa-a2cf-11e7-93fe-f1ba1594507e.png)\r\n\r\n**Stable**\r\n![stable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3104489/30887301-a1e266a0-a2cf-11e7-9ab2-892287913b5b.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35187","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35187/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35187/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35187/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35187","id":260788235,"number":35187,"title":"Issues

Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Use Help > Report Issues to prefill these. -->\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.16.1\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 17.10\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nvscode does not automatically put a newline on the last line of a file in its default configuration. This is much different (and therefore surprising) behavior when compared with virtually all text manipulation tools for Unix-like OSes over the last few decades.\r\n\r\nIn Unix, a text file is composed of a series of zero or more lines. Each line is terminated by a newline (ASCII `0a`) character. It follows then that unless the file has no characters, a text file should always end in a newline. For a simple example, we can use the shell to create a new file containing a string:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ echo 'line of text' > foo.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow if we look at the raw byes of the file, we see that a newline (`0a`) was automatically added to the file by the `echo` command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ hexdump -C foo.txt \r\n00000000  6c 69 6e 65 20 6f 66 20  74 65 78 74 0a           |line of text.|\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is desireable behavior because if you want to use standard Unix tools to work on the file, they will generally expect all lines to end in a newline whether it's printing the file to `stdout`, combining files, or performing complicated search and replace operations via regular expressions. We can see this in action by printing the file to stdout with `cat`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat foo.txt\r\nline of text\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the shell prompt is one line after the file contents. The shell didn't do this, it was the result of the newline at the end of the file.\r\n\r\nAll other text editors operating in a Unix-like environment append a newline to the last (or only) line in the file. This includes nano, vim, emacs, etc. However, the trailing newline is not displayed and you cannot (normally) delete it. Contrast with vscode which does not append a trailing newline. \r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n* Open a new file (Ctrl+n)\r\n* Enter the exact string (without quotes) \"line of text\"\r\n* Save (Ctrl+s) the file as bar.txt\r\n\r\nNow open the terminal and print the file to stdout:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat bar.txt\r\nline of text$\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how the shell prompt appears on the same line as the contents of the file, indicating the lack of a newline at the end of the file.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nOn Unix-based platforms (OSX and Linux), vscode should automatically append a newline to the end of every file as all other text editors for traditional Unix-like systems do. Further, it should not allow the user to see or remove the trailing newline by default, although a setting can be made for users who do want to see it.\r\n\r\nI don't know how the Windows platform handles newlines so I defer to others on the platform-specific default behavior there.\r\n\r\n# Workarounds\r\n\r\nThere is a setting called `files.insertFinalNewline` but this is set to `false` by default on Unix-derived platforms. While it solves part of the problem, the final newline is displayed (as an empty line at the end of the file) and can be removed. Although saving the file again always brings it back.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35181/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35180","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35180/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35180/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35180/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35180","id":260783256,"number":35180,"title":"Node
