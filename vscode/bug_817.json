VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: OSX 10.11.6\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open a file\n2. Open 2 more editors to get three-panel view by hitting \"cmd+\\\"\n3. Close file in right editor\n\nExpected: File in right editor closes but editor/panel stays expanded, retaining desired three-panel view.\nResult: File closes but so does editor, so that only 2 editors in 2-panel view are left.\n## Request:\n\nAllow empty editors/panels. If all tabs are closed for an editor it should stay open. (An option for this would be great i.e. `workspace.allowEmptyEditors`, `workspace.dontCloseEmptyEditor` or whatever.)\n## Context/User-Perspective:\n\n**tl;dr**: Just because I closed the last tab for an editor doesn't mean I want the layout to change. I just don't want that file open anymore.\n\nMy reasoning for this preference is that I like to keep my workspace \"clean\" as it were. I like to focus on the code I'm currently working on and only really keep other files open as reference material. Visually speaking, I also like having the file I'm currently working on centered. Currently I have to keep adjusting the editor's widths depending on how many are open and which files I've closed. It'd be nice to just have a fixed 3 panel layout like what is possible in SublimeText.\n## Examples\n\nThe behavior I'm looking for can be seen in SublimeText:\n\nNotice here the right tab-group has no files but is still there.\n![screen shot 2016-08-30 at 6 53 27 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1890516/18111210/59576c30-6ee3-11e6-857c-385d57a36973.png)\n\nAnd in this one I've closed all the files in the left tab group but it stays open. In VS Code this would cause the left editor to collapse and the middle editor to be the first.\n![screen shot 2016-08-30 at 6 53 35

VSCode Version:1.3.1\n\nHi,\n\nI am trying to debug  my code inside Visual studio code by launching nodejs.\nThe procedures are as below:\n\n1- In a specific folder (/home/s/workspace/ myui) I have created  files(server.js,package.json) for node settings:\nNote: The path is outside of my project\na)First file is :\nserver.js:\n\n```\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\napp.use(\n    express.static(\"/home/s/git/ui\") //where your static content is located in your filesystem\n);\napp.listen(3002, function () {\n  console.log('Express server listening on

files.and there is no a seprated folder for putting all typescript files. all of them are besides their js.\n\nlast step is my launch.json:\n\n```\n{\n \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n  \"configurations\":

myui/server.js \nDebugger listening on port 5858\nExpress server listening on port 3002!\n\nand when I try to attach the project to the specific url, nothing happen.\n\nWhat is wrong in my

VSCode Version: 1.40\n- OS Version: Windows 10 v. 1511\n- IPython Version: 5.1\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open integrated terminal and run `ipython`.\n2. In editor (do not hide terminal window), type `print('hello world')`.\n3. Highlight text and use VS Code command `Terminal: Run Selected Text in Active Terminal`.\n\nAt this stage, the code has loaded into the iPython terminal but has not actually executed.\n\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21263827/18107572/123a3f36-6ece-11e6-8118-236f8793a3a9.PNG)\n\nThe user is required to press Enter in the terminal pane to actually execute the code. (Visual Studio Community with PTVS works as expected: the script runs upon Shift+Alt+F5.) You will notice in the screenshot that after running the selected text, the curor is still in the code panel. Therefore, if you press Enter (in an attempt to execute the code in the terminal pane), your selected text in the editor will be deleted. The only way to complete the code run in the terminal is to, after step 3, either (a) mouse over and click in the terminal panel and hit Enter, or (b) hit Ctrl+` twice to hide and show the terminal panel (which will also focus the panel) and then hit Enter. This is inefficient. The code should either fully execute upon the run command (as it does in Visual Studio) or the terminal pane should automatically focus so the user can hit enter to complete the code run.\n\nNote that when the terminal window is hidden at the time the selected code is run, the terminal opens and is simultaneously focused. The user can then hit Enter to complete the run with little additional effort.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11252","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11252/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11252/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11252/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11252","id":174128324,"number":11252,"title":"Bad
