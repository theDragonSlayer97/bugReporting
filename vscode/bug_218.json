when one uses features such as git diff viewing, or editing settings etc. that themselves use a dual pane view whilst using the editor in a split view already (which I constantly do) VS Code splits the active editor group of the split view (which is already half of the editor window width minus the side bar) to display the two panes (which now end up being quarter width) making any editing inside them nearly impossible until the editor split bar is dragged to widen the active group as much as possible.\r\n\r\nWhat it should be doing is reusing the existing split so that the panes of the dual pane view are assigned to the active and consecutive editor group (i.e. assuming the user has split the editor into three groups, displaying git diff with center group active would cause the diff to be displayed on the center and right group). \r\n\r\nThis would greatly improve the usability of such features for users like myself that work mostly or very often with the editor split vertically.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29258/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29257","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29257/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29257/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29257/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/29257","id":237773972,"number":29257,"title":"Add

For that we used the folder path as identifier to know which UI state to restore. This does however not work if you open an empty folder where we do not have such a folder path for identifying the UI state. The fix was to introduce a new identifier for empty windows to save and load UI state via local storage. This identifier is derived from the backup location for hot exit which we always have to enable hot exit scenarios for any window (folder or empty).\r\n\r\n**Basic Functionality**\r\n* verify an empty window restores its UI state (e.g. opened files) between restarts\r\n* verify this also works for window reload\r\n* verify this also restores the windows dimensions and location on screen\r\n* verify the empty window is no longer restored once you\r\n  * open a specific file or folder from the command line\r\n  * open a specific file or folder from the context menu of the OS explorer\r\n  * open up with the \"-n\" flag to force an empty window\r\n* verify that opening a new window from the running instance always opens it with default UI state (= empty)\r\n\r\n**New Setting**\r\n\r\nWe always had a setting `window.reopenFolders` to control the windows that should be restored (none, one or all). This setting has been renamed to `window.reopenWindows` to better reflect the scenario of restoring empty windows. \r\n\r\nWe still want to support the old setting, so verify that\r\n* `window.reopenFolders: none` restores no window (neither empty, nor folders)\r\n* `window.reopenFolders: all` restores all windows (empty and folders) and their size/location on screen\r\n\r\nVerify the new setting:\r\n* `window.reopenWindows: none` restores no window (neither empty, nor folders)\r\n* `window.reopenWindows: folders` only restores windows that had folders opened\r\n* * `window.reopenWindows: all` restores all windows (empty and folders) and their size/location on screen\r\n\r\n**Hot Exit**\r\n\r\nIf you have made changes to files in either an empty window or window with folder opened we always restore that window, independent of any setting.\r\n* verify that UI state and window size/location on screen gets restored for all windows that have dirty files independent from the `window.reopenWindows`
