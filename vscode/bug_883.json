After doing this, VSCode started acting strange and seemed like it was ignoring `tsconfig.json`: it, for example, would not detect any typings and assumed that things like `Object.assign` didn't exist.\n\nIt was not throwing it's toys out of the pram due to syntax etc, _just_ typings.\n\nHere's my tsconfig\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es6\",\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"sourceRoot\": \"./app\",\n    \"allowJs\": true,\n    \"noResolve\": true\n  },\n  \"include\": [ \"typings/index.d.ts\" ],\n  \"files\": [\n    \"app/boot.js\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n`typings/index.d.ts` is generated from the following typings.json\n\n```\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"bluebird\": \"registry:npm/bluebird#3.3.4+20160531224558\",\n    \"lodash\": \"registry:npm/lodash#4.0.0+20160416211519\",\n    \"redux\": \"registry:npm/redux#3.0.6+20160214194820\",\n    \"redux-thunk\": \"registry:npm/redux-thunk#2.0.0+20160525185520\"\n  },\n  \"globalDependencies\": {\n    \"angular\": \"registry:dt/angular#1.5.0+20160602160139\",\n    \"angular-locker\": \"registry:dt/angular-locker#2.0.3+20160317120654\",\n    \"angular-sanitize\": \"registry:dt/angular-sanitize#1.3.0+20160317120654\",\n    \"angular-translate\": \"registry:dt/angular-translate#2.4.0+20160505162438\",\n    \"angular-ui-router\": \"registry:dt/angular-ui-router#1.1.5+20160521151413\",\n    \"html\": \"file:.typings/html.d.ts\",\n    \"isomorphic-fetch\": \"registry:dt/isomorphic-fetch#0.0.0+20160524142046\",\n    \"jquery\": \"registry:dt/jquery#1.10.0+20160417213236\",\n    \"kendo-ui-professional\": \"file:.typings/kendo.d.ts\",\n    \"moment-node\": \"registry:dt/moment-node#2.11.1+20160511043338\",\n    \"scss\": \"file:.typings/scss.d.ts\",\n    \"ui-select\": \"registry:dt/ui-select#0.13.2+20160317120654\",\n    \"url\": \"file:.typings/url.d.ts\",\n    \"webpack-env\": \"registry:dt/webpack-env#1.12.2+20160316155526\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`npm run typecheck`, which executes `tsc --noEmit` works perfectly fine.  However, I have the following `.vscode/tasks.json`:\n\n```\n{\n  // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\n  // for the documentation about the tasks.json format\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"command\": \"tsc\",\n  \"isShellCommand\": true,\n  \"args\": [\"-p\", \".\", \"--noEmit\"],\n  \"showOutput\": \"silent\",\n  \"problemMatcher\": \"$tsc\"\n}\n```\n\nThis runs `tsc --noEmit -p .` and this seems to be causing the issue by igoring any and all typings.\n\nI'm assuming it has something to do with `-p .`, but it makes no sense for this to randomly stop working.\n\nFWIW, here is my `settings.json`. `typescript.tsdk` points to `typescript@beta`.\n\n```\n// Place your settings in this file to overwrite default and user settings.\n{\n  \"editor.tabSize\": 2,\n  \"files.exclude\": {\n    \"**/.git\": true,\n    \"**/.svn\": true,\n    \"**/.DS_Store\": true,\n    \"**/*.{pubxml,csproj*}\": true,\n    \"**/{obj,bin}\": true,\n    \"typings/\": true,\n    \"node_modules/\": true\n  },\n  \"typescript.tsdk\": \"node_modules/typescript/lib\"\n}\n```\n\nNote that it would also appear that my VSCode is no longer tracking errors across the project either: It now only tracks errors when I view specific files.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9271","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9271/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9271/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9271/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9271","id":165528674,"number":9271,"title":"Shift-Return

The existing code already folds multiple decorations on the same line with the same class name.\nThe divs are still absolutely positioned, at the same location, so there's not more horizontal space
