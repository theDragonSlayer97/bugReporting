[GitLens](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens) with a feature to provide \"inline\" blame support to the active text editor.

If that inline style is changed to `min-width` everything works, but I'm not sure on the ripple effect. Nor could I find exactly where that inline style is being added -- it looks like it starts in [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/973c3bdae5cb6ef1117773a6fd5168765c785438/src/vs/editor/common/viewLayout/viewLineParts.ts#L103).

VSCode Version: 1.5.0\n- OS Version: OS X 10.11.6\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n- Choose any git repo, add a file `test.js` with the following content\n\n``` js\nvar foo = 1;\nvar bar = 2;\n```\n\nAdd the file and commit it.\n- Remove the second line, so the file ends up with:\n\n``` js\nvar foo = 1;\n```\n- In VSCode's git viewlet, choose `Undo Last Commit`\n\nNow the file is:\n\n``` js\nvar foo = 1;\n```\n\nand this bit\n\n``` js\nvar bar = 2;\n```\n\nis permanently lost.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. If user has uncommited changes, prompt him to stash before doing Undo Last Commit. Or\n2. Use `git reset --soft` instead of `git reset`, which defaults to `--mixed`. In this case, when user has staged but uncommited changes, prompt him to either commit or unstage them.\n   The benefit of using `--soft` this way is all last commit changes will end up in staged mode, whereas any local changes won't. So user could select which change they want, if the same file is edited both on last commit and locally.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11476","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11476/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11476/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11476/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11476","id":174857650,"number":11476,"title":"PHP one-line functions syntax highlighting","user":{"login":"BenjaVR","id":17981138,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/17981138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaVR","html_url":"https://github.com/BenjaVR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaVR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaVR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaVR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaVR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaVR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaVR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaVR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaVR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaVR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":293379998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/languages%20basic","name":"languages basic","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-02T22:15:16Z","updated_at":"2016-09-05T06:02:41Z","closed_at":"2016-09-05T06:02:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If I use one-line functions in my PHP files, they don't get highlighted.

item is intended as a discussion for the future of the debug console. Currently we use the tree to represent all elements in the debug console. This has worked well thus far but has certain limitations. The benefit of using the tree is that we can easily render complex elements - the ones that have children. The tree also allows us to lazily fetch the children of each element and is virtualised.\r\n### Motivation for the change\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1957\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4338\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4326\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2163\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6845\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/228\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10680\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26641\r\n\r\n### Option 1: use the editor and simulate the tree using editor decorations\r\n\r\n**pro:** find, selection, word wrap, performance\r\n**con:** have to simulate the tree by using editor decorations / indentation, not enough flexibility (for possibly future requests of rendering custom things in the debug console). \r\n\r\nNote: editor could be enhanced to render custom images, but customly rendered output which the user can interact with is tricky.\r\n### Option 2: use the editor but render a tree per complex object in a custom editor widget\r\n\r\n**pro:** most similar to what we currently have with some benefits on top (able to find/copy outside of complex objects)\r\n**con:** find and selection will not work inside the tree, thus making it hard to copy / find contents inside complex objects\r\n### Option 3: render the debug console not using existing widgets\r\n\r\n**pro:** gives most flexibility\r\n**con:** no virtualisation, slow for a large number of elements, have to rewrite find widget, word wraping\r\n\r\nChrome debug console is a good example of this. They can render multiple complex elements side by side and expand / collapse them.\r\n\r\n@weinand @alexandrudima please edit / modify as you see fit. I might have missed some of the pro/cons that we discussed, I just simply wrote what we have talked about this afternoon.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11462/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11461","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11461/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11461/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11461/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11461","id":174783835,"number":11461,"title":"Do
