Launch vscode and install the '_[Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat](http://bit.ly/redhatjavaextn)_'  extension.\r\n3. Restart vscode.\r\n\r\nOn restart, error messages appear; reporting that components required for the '_[Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat](http://bit.ly/redhatjavaextn)_' extension, failed to initiate.\r\n\r\n_[Reading and analyzing the stacktrace in vscode's log files](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/978956/library.libjunixsocket-native-2.0.4.so.not.found.0.stacktrace.txt)_, a \"_Library 'libjunixsocket-native-2.0.4.so' not found!_\" error entry identifies the root cause. That library was tracked down to '[user.home.dir]/.vscode/extensions/redhat.java-0.3.0/server/config_linux/org.eclipse.osgi/45/0/.cp/lib/junixsocket-native-common-2.0.4.jar'.\r\n\r\nThis is a listing of the native libraries contained in 1.12.0's '_junixsocket-native-common-2.0.4.jar_'...\r\n\r\n```\r\nlib/x86_64-MacOSX-gpp/\r\nlib/x86_64-MacOSX-gpp/jni/\r\nlib/x86_64-MacOSX-gpp/jni/history.xml\r\nlib/x86_64-MacOSX-gpp/jni/libjunixsocket-native-2.0.4.dylib\r\nlib/x86_64-MacOSX-gpp/jni/libjunixsocket-native-2.0.4.jnilib\r\nlib/amd64-Linux-gpp/\r\nlib/amd64-Linux-gpp/jni/\r\nlib/amd64-Linux-gpp/jni/libjunixsocket-native-2.0.4.so\r\nlib/amd64-Linux-gpp/jni/history.xml\r\n```\r\nNotice that the only Linux library distributed in the 32Bit 1.12.0 release, is the one built for the amd64 [_**64Bit**_] architecture! It is therefore incompatible with the 32Bit Linux on which 32Bit versions of vscode are meant to be installed.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious to me after seeing the above files in the 1.12.20 jar, that the system — _knowing that it is running on an i386 OS_ — is attempting to locate a library built for an i386 architecture. But there isn't one  distributed in the 1.12.20 release. Hence the \"_Library 'libjunixsocket-native-2.0.4.so' not found!_\" error. \r\n\r\nI _[downloaded the junixsocket-parent-2.0.4 source from here](https://github.com/kohlschutter/junixsocket/releases/tag/junixsocket-parent-2.0.4)_ and built it on my 32bit Ubuntu machine, using maven.\r\n\r\nI then replaced the original amd64 64Bit '_junixsocket-native-common-2.0.4.jar_' with the 32Bit one that I built _[from the source](http://bit.ly/redhatjavaextn)_. Details of the steps I took _[are listed here](http://bit.ly/javavscode45)_.\r\n\r\nOn my Ubuntu 12_04 LTS machine, my freshly-built 32Bit [_**i386**_] replacement '_libjunixsocket-native-2.0.4.so_' library and jar files, perfectly resolved _[the defect described in detail here](http://bit.ly/vscodejava45)_.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26027","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26027/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26027/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26027/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26027","id":226553080,"number":26027,"title":"Cannot make the completion item to overwrite further than the current identifier/token","user":{"login":"DominikDitoIvosevic","id":6378638,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6378638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikDitoIvosevic","html_url":"https://github.com/DominikDitoIvosevic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikDitoIvosevic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikDitoIvosevic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikDitoIvosevic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikDitoIvosevic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikDitoIvosevic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikDitoIvosevic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikDitoIvosevic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikDitoIvosevic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikDitoIvosevic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-05-05T12:05:49Z","updated_at":"2017-05-19T15:01:49Z","closed_at":"2017-05-05T13:47:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.12.1\r\n- OS Version: Win10 Creators\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. write `field(;FirstValue){}`\r\n2. request completion after open paren (\r\n3. get returned `SecondValue;SecondValue` with span from `(` to `)`\r\n4. `;FirstValue` does not get removed\r\n\r\nExpected: `field(SecondValue;SecondValue)`\r\nActual: `field(SecondValue;SecondValue;FirstValue)`\r\n\r\nIt looks to me that you can't replace characters which don't belong to the current token even if you specify a TextSpan which encompasses the other characters.

VSCode Version:  1.11.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nAssume the following code (cursor is where the `|` is):\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nfoo() {\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nmain() {\r\n  fo|\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompletion is returning `foo()`. If the user continues to type `o(` then the `o` and `(` are \"subtracted\" from the completion client-side by Code (it doesn't send another request to the completion provider). This works great; however since typing the `(` auto-inserts a `)` if the user then uses the completion, they will end up with:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nmain() {\r\n  foo()) // <-- two closing parens\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's an animation showing a slightly different version or this at https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/285\r\n\r\nI can't see how the completion provider can fix this, since Code has taken over completion at this point (it's filtering and reducing the completion text client-side). I think the best thing would be for Code to subtract any auto-inserted characters from the end of the completion text in the same way it's removing the typed characters from the start.\r\n\r\nEg, when the user types the `(`:\r\n1. Filter the completion list by the `(`\r\n2. Remove the `(` from the completion text to be inserted, and adjust the range accordingly\r\n3. Because a character was auto-inserted after the cursor, subtract that character from the end of the insertion text (and adjust the range) if it's the same character\r\n\r\nI think 1 & 2 already happen, I think 3 would make sense to fix this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26011","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26011/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26011/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26011/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26011","id":226522225,"number":26011,"title":"UI: Use em dash (—) as window title separator on macOS","user":{"login":"wangcheng678","id":1688764,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1688764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangcheng678","html_url":"https://github.com/wangcheng678","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangcheng678/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangcheng678/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangcheng678/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangcheng678/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangcheng678/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangcheng678/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangcheng678/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangcheng678/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangcheng678/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":256129996,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"fef2c0","default":true},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Lixire","id":13241824,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13241824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire","html_url":"https://github.com/Lixire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Lixire","id":13241824,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13241824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire","html_url":"https://github.com/Lixire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lixire/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-05-05T09:42:33Z","updated_at":"2017-05-15T21:12:41Z","closed_at":"2017-05-15T21:12:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Most macOS apps (like Terminal.app) use em dash (`—`) instead of en dash (`-`) as window title separator.

VSCode Version: 1.12.1\r\n- OS Version: MacOs Sierra\r\n\r\nHi, I tried to bind this commands : \r\n```\r\n  {\r\n    \"key\": \"home\",\r\n    \"command\": \"workbench.action.navigateLeft\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"key\": \"end\",\r\n    \"command\": \"workbench.action.navigateRight\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"key\": \"pageup\",\r\n    \"command\": \"workbench.action.navigateUp\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"key\": \"pagedown\",\r\n    \"command\": \"workbench.action.navigateDown\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe two first (home & end) allow me to switch my active cursor to left and right panel.\r\nBut neither navigateUp or navigateDown seems to work correctly.\r\n\r\n**First:** Here is a scenario, with following commands : \r\n- workbench.action.navigateRight (+some moves)\r\n- workbench.action.navigateRight (+some moves)\r\n- workbench.action.navigateRight (+some moves)\r\n- workbench.action.navigateTop, but i'm stuck in file explorer\r\nbut as you can see, i'm unable to switch to the top \"opened editor\" panel with navigateTop\r\n![switchpanel](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5599375/25738739/14f6fdda-317f-11e7-9ae6-f35fb53a93b5.gif)\r\n\r\n**Second:** Another scenario, with following commands : \r\n- workbench.action.navigateRight (+some moves)\r\n- workbench.action.navigateLeft (+some moves)\r\n- workbench.action.navigateDown\r\n- now i'm stuck in the terminal, none workbench.action.navigateXXX works anymore\r\n![switchpanel2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5599375/25739016/47ab6238-3180-11e7-98fb-adc2bd9f0f70.gif)\r\n\r\nI don't find any other command allowing to go out of the terminal, or to switch between open editor and the explorer file list. Maybe i missed it and i can add command with conditions to allow me doing that.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to be able to work without touching my mouse.
