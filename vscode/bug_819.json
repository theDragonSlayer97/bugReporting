VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro\n\nI think would be nice if we could filter changes in the Git Changes Panel. I work in a project that often we have a lot of changes in files that I don't want to commit right now. So I need to carefully choose files in Git Panel to adding them to stage. Here an example:\n\n![git-panel](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2868031/18089926/a0f586da-6e98-11e6-8f21-ff2d0bd65abf.png)\n\nI'd like to commit only gulp tasks in a project with 19 files changes. With an input text to input a filepath to filter (typing 'gulp' in my case - or just '*.ts'), I'll be able to select only the files that I want. Would be great for me. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11207","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11207/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11207/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11207/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11207","id":174013119,"number":11207,"title":"Every restart of a node application is creating a new integrated terminal","user":{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-30T13:03:08Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T13:11:36Z","closed_at":"2016-08-30T13:11:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Testing #11091\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

[WSO2](https://github.com/wso2) we are trying to build a new tooling platform using web-based technologies on top of VSCode. The initial requirement is to build an interactive sequence diagram editor for [WSO2 Gateway](https://github.com/wso2/carbon-gateway-framework/) for modelling integration workflows. \n\nWe went through VSCode extension model and the existing extensions for available diagramming tools but could not find something similar to $subject. We found several options for integrating JS based sequence diagramming tools but they do not support interactive drawing.\n\nThe goal of this effort is as follows:\n- Implement a new sequence diagram editor in JS and integrate it with VSCode. We have already started this and source code can be found [here](https://github.com/wso2-incubator/js-tooling-framework/tree/master/sequence-editor).\n- Allow users to interactively draw sequence diagrams on VSCode. \n- Introduce [a new language](https://github.com/wso2/carbon-gateway-framework/blob/master/gateway-core/components/org.wso2.carbon.gateway.core/src/main/antlr4/org/wso2/carbon/gateway/core/config/dsl/external/wuml/generated/WUML.g4) for defining sequence diagrams and provide language support on VSCode may be using language server.\n- Transform visual diagrams into sequence diagram definitions and save as files.\n- Once sequence diagram definition files are opened in VSCode, render them in visual mode.\n- Allow users to define the sequence flow in both source mode and visual mode.\n- Integrate VSCode editor features with the visual representation of the diagrams. For an example debugging, opening up property windows for managing metadata of diagram elements, adding new buttons in VSCode for managing diagramming features, etc.\n- Finally, make this tooling solution accessible on the web.\n\nQ1: Would it be feasible to do this via the VSCode extension API?\n\nQ2: If not will us be able to extend VSCode at the editor abstraction and integrate a new visual sequence diagram editor similar to [Monaco](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor)? \n\nQ3: Would it be possible to run VSCode on the web and make it accessible via a web browser?\nWe noticed that Microsoft has done this [at some point](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Visual-Studio-Online) but could not find much information on how to do it.\n\nReally appreciate your thoughts on this!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11201","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11201/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11201/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11201/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11201","id":174006628,"number":11201,"title":"returning LaunchResponse with success = false causes exception","user":{"login":"reuterm","id":14981901,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14981901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuterm","html_url":"https://github.com/reuterm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuterm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuterm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuterm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuterm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuterm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuterm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuterm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuterm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuterm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-08-30T12:32:05Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T13:09:24Z","closed_at":"2016-08-30T13:09:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: Windows 7\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
