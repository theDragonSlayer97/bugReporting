VSCode Version: 1.0.0\n- OS Version: any\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a decoration type `window.createTextEditorDecorationType({ gutterIconPath: ... });` with an icon, decorate a line.\n2. Set a breakpoint for the line. While the breakpoint works, the decoration type gutter icon is completely hiding it.\n\nIdeally, there should be a way to see both (all) icons. I'm assuming the same issue happens if two different extensions set different icons for the same line. Atom and IntelliJ platform based IDEs solve this by allowing to create a plugin specific gutter/or just extending the gutter horizontally to fit all icons.\n\nIf the above mentioned solution is not desirable for some reason, then it should probably be allowed to set a gutter icon `zIndex` for a decoration type. Or maybe the breakpoint icon should just take precedence and always be displayed above any extensions icons.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5923/reactions","total_count":23,"+1":23,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5922","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5922/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5922/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5922/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5922","id":151520111,"number":5922,"title":"Debug

Debugging worked fine in the previous version of insiders and in the stable 1.0.0 build, so I thought this bug is best posted here. I haven't tried vscode with anything other than go, so I'm not sure if it's just a language specific issue.\n\nIn the previous Insiders and stable versions, a compile failure will show a debug
