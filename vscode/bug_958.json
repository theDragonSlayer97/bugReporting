VSCode Version: 1.1.1\n- OS Version: 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Install VS Code.\n2. Install one or more extensions.\n3. Notice that there is a `.vscode` folder in your user directory.\n\nIn Windows, the root of the user directory is _NOT_ the right place to store application settings.  This is a very common convention in Linux but Windows != Linux and not all Windows users want to pretend they are running Linux.  In windows the correct location for application settings is `%APPDATA%` and the correct location for extensions is `%LOCALAPPDATA%` or `%PROGRAMDATA%` (depending on level of security consciousness).\n\nTo avoid a flame war, I want to be clear that this issue isn't debating _why_ `C:/Users/<username>/.<appname>` is the wrong place for these files, it is only asserting that Microsoft has very clearly documented the _right_ place for settings files and VSCode does not follow it.  If the authors of VSCode have consciously decided to go against the long-running convention established by the OS authors then I won't press on the issue (though I think that would be a silly decision for VSCode).

or not, the first idea comes to people's mind is viewing the installed extensions list and see if there is any hint. `Show Outdated Extensions` is more or less a short-cut. Of course, this is just my personal opinion and has nothing to do with this PR. This commit only brings the same functionality to `Show Installed Extensions`.\n\n@joaomoreno, I saw you put this issue in backlog so I take it for practice.

VSCode Version: 1.1.1\n- OS Version: Windows\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Defines a `onDidSelectItem` function that will open and show a text document, like this:\n\n``` typescript\n  let options = <vscode.QuickPickOptions>{  \n    placeHolder: 'Type a line number or a piece of code to navigate to',\n    matchOnDescription: true,\n    onDidSelectItem: item => {\n      if (item.detail.toString().toLowerCase() == vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri.fsPath.toLowerCase()) {\n        revealLine(parseInt(item.label) - 1);\n      } else { // here is the problem\n        let uriDocument: vscode.Uri = vscode.Uri.file(item.detail.toString());\n        vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(uriDocument).then(doc => {\n          vscode.window.showTextDocument(doc).then(editor => {\n             // any code can be added here\n             //revealLine(parseInt(item.label) - 1);\n          });\n        });\n      }\n    }\n  };\n```\n1. Shows a `vscode.window.showQuickPick`, with that `vscode.QuickPickOptions`, like this:\n\n``` typescript\n  vscode.window.showQuickPick(items, options).then(selection => {\n    // do anything\n  });\n```\n\nWhenever the `else` code block in `onDidSelectItem` function is reached (wich will load another document) the PickList disappears. (no matter the code added inside `showTextDocument`, even nothing).\n\nI don't know if this is the expected behavior or not, but it would good that the PickList remains visible.

To not have each of them with their own `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `node_modules`, etc, we have those at `public/docs/_examples` and with a gulp task, we copy all the files to each of those projects (we symlink the node_modules).\n\nSo at the end, we have like 20 TS projects, 20 node_modules (in reality 20 symlinks), 20 `tsconfig.json`, etc.\n\nWhat's the problem here? If we open a file like `e2e-spec.js` (is inside each TS project but in a parent directory from the `tsconfig.json`.), and you over something, you get a \"Loading...\" popup and never get any hover information nor intellisense.\n\nI believe VSCODE is trying to index all those 20 node_module folders before show anything. A few processes at 100% could confirm that.\n\nIf I fresh open VSCODE, go to a file inside any of those projects and I hover something, it works perfectly (because it has a `tsconfig.json` that would exclude node_modules), but as soon as I hover something in a file that doesn't have a tsconfig for it, it will try to index all the project and blow up.\n1. git clone https://github.com/angular/angular.io\n2. cd angular.io\n3. npm install\n4. cd public/docs/_examples\n5. npm install\n6. cd ../../..\n7. gulp add-example-boilerplate\n8. open editor, go to `public/docs/_examples/architecture/e2e-spec.js` and hover something. Loading....\n9. close the editor, wait for all Electron processes to die.\n10. open VSCODE, go to `public/docs/_examples/architecture/ts/app/main.ts` and see how it works.\n11. Go to any `e2e-spec.js` to trigger this massive index and if you go back to the `main.ts` it doesn't work anymore.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7016","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7016/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7016/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7016/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7016","id":157409835,"number":7016,"title":"Stopping debugging while on a breakpoint crashes vscode","user":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":293389403,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/freeze-slow-crash","name":"freeze-slow-crash","color":"eb6420","default":false},{"id":287991608,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/important","name":"important","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":404225303,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/not-reproducible","name":"not-reproducible","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":15,"created_at":"2016-05-29T22:35:14Z","updated_at":"2016-09-02T12:09:49Z","closed_at":"2016-07-05T16:02:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"- VSCode Version: Version 1.2.0-alpha, Commit 2833eb9d664db9c5a77bdf5fb19d7d7fefd4653c\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
