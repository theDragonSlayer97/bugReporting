VSCode Version: 1.1.0\n- OS Version: WIN10 x64\n- Node.js 4.4.4\n\nI have a rather complex web-app, heavily reliable on express, mongoose, Q, etc... , thus making input->output chains extremely long from the compiler point of view. so more often than not debugger just gives up on me:\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/105338698/ShareX/2016-05/Code_2016-05-10_13-28-41.png) \n\nAnd its not like these values are inaccessible - no, I can view them just fine if add them to the watch (but I have to add the explicit path to the primitive value, since anything object-like won't be expandable and I can't do it for every single piece of data) or I can use the console:\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/105338698/ShareX/2016-05/Code_2016-05-08_06-50-35.png)\nThe problem is I have to manually do it. Another way is to `step over` since it would refresh the watchers, but that's not a solution since data can change in this one step or even the debugger can jump out of the context in question.\n\nAnd moving forward also leads to an another problem: - stepping/resuming will cause an error message.\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/105338698/ShareX/2016-05/Code_2016-05-09_09-06-04.png)\nor sometimes this\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/105338698/ShareX/2016-05/Code_2016-05-09_15-16-06.png)\nthe funny thing is, I have never experienced an actual decoupling of the debugger from the process - hitting \"close\" on this message and then repeating the action always resumes the debugging session. The annoying thing is I have to hit \"close\" twice or even thrice (the message reappears at least once). always. never once. almost every time I `continue` or want to `step into/over` and I have to do it since this message covers the debugger controls. And I can't use the keyboard enter/esc key - I have to grab the mouse, since the errors aren't modular and do not receive focus.\n\nSo, for the fist part (<...> for variable values) - **maybe you could implement refreshing mechanic, on doubleclicking on them?**\nAnd for the second part (error messages) - **some sort of option to control over this mysterious \"amount of time\" the debugger deems as \"reasonable\"?**\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nyeah, thats a problem, I can't share my project, and I don't know how to forcefully lag the workflow - I tried to build a test case similar to my project, but it seems it is still \"lightweight\" enough to not cause the mentioned behavior...\n\nthank

I have added the jsconfig.json into root of my project and it looks like this:\n\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"ES6\",\n        \"module\": \"commonjs\"\n    },\n    \"exclude\": [\n        \"node-modules\", \"bower_components\", \"dist\"\n    ]\n}\n\nProject basically contains some node.js, some react etc. \n\nBut, the intellisense and all ide features are just broken. No code correction, no intellisense, not with in the file, for example creating a variable with String initializer, like this:\n\nvar a = \"aaa\";\n\nVS Code is not able to recognize the a as a String. So no proposals what so ever when I try to get them show. Also I can write full non sense where ever I want and there are no error or warning markers what so ever. \n\nAlso when I open the VS Code, it will show \"Loading...\" for a while for things I try to hover but after that, nothing. \n\nOnly \"intellisense\" autocompletion I get is just autocomplete to words I have used in the same file. Words, no variables of nothing like that, just words. \n\nOnly thing more I can provide is that when I open the developer tools in the VS Code I get this error (repeatedly):\n\nVSCode-linux-x64/resources/app/out/vs/workbench/workbench.main.js:91 \n[Extension Host] Object\nCommand: \"projectInfo\"\nmessage: \"Error processing request. Cannot read property 'projectFilename' of undefined.\"\n\nIt also presents itself in threadService.ts:198\n\nAs I have tries Googling this, set the project up tens of times and I'm not able to find any help, I'm starting to think that this is bug. Also what ever happens it probably should not brake like this.\n\nIf more information or tests are wanted, please contact me. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6238","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6238/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6238/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6238/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6238","id":153977327,"number":6238,"title":"Go To Definition(F12) option need to be enhanced (Even the Definition one is in another page with in the project))like sublime text?i'm facing this issue from long since i install VS code ?Any help on this?
