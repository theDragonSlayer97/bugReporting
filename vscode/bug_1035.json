Given the dust template I'm using, I believe it may be a failure in the eq test.  _BUT_ I know this isn't a Dust.js problem because it works if I save it from emacs:\n\nSteps to fix:\n1. Open partial saved above, e.g., the menuItem.toggle.dust.code attached, in a good editor, e.g., emacs.\n2. Add and delete a space, then save\n3. Re-run dust rendering.\n\nThe output will be as expected. I was able to toggle back & forth between the two editors and consistently reproduce the results. What emacs saved worked fine. What code saved _did not_.\n\nI've attached the two partials. I'm guessing it's a unicode/text format  issue. None of my diff tools showed any difference, but CLEARLY dust.js is treating one differently from the other.\n\n[menuItem.toggle.dust.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/192799/menuItem.toggle.dust.zip)\n\nFWIW, here is the template in those attached files:\n\n``` dust\n{@eq key=widget

On the error pop-up user is getting two options \"Continue\" and \"Close\" when user clicks on \"Close\" then debugging should be stopped (This is same behavior like in visual studio when we get build error it asks for continue or close) but I observed when user clicks on close then the error pop-up closed but application remain in debugging mode forever.\n2. When user tries to terminate the debug session by clicking on Stop button then nothing is happening.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17735796/14094824/c72715a2-f50e-11e5-9ea8-e34cfad258c3.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4725","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4725/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4725/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4725/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4725","id":144122396,"number":4725,"title":"[c#] Syntax highlighter not recognizing strings","user":{"login":"jamesqo","id":9159214,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9159214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesqo","html_url":"https://github.com/jamesqo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesqo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesqo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesqo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesqo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesqo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesqo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesqo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesqo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesqo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-29T00:46:51Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T07:24:28Z","closed_at":"2016-03-29T07:24:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- VSCode Version: 0.10.11\n- OS Version: Windows 10.0.10586\n\nThe VSCode editor sometimes doesn't recognize strings in C# source files, leading it to highlight code as strings and other strings as code.

VSCode Version: 0.10.11\n- OS Version: OS X 10.10.5\n- Typescript: 1.8.9\n- Node: 5.9.0\n\nPossibly related to #2157, #1384\n\nAfter upgrading typescript from 1.6 to 1.8.9, and node from 0.12 to 5.9.0, I noticed breakpoints no longer working and other strange behavior.\n- Debugger fails to stop at breakpoints in .ts file\n- Debugger shows .js file instead of .ts when attaching to node --debug-brk\n- Double entries for same breakpoint appear in \"breakpoints\" pane\n\nIts been difficult to produce a good test case for this bug due to nondeterministic behavior. I've seen symptoms appear or disappear after:\n- Commenting/uncommenting parts of the code and recompiling\n- Copying the .ts file to an identical copy and debugging\n\nPossible causes that have been ruled out:\n- \"outDir\" setting (separate outDir or not makes no difference)\n- \"typescript.tsdk\" 1.8.9 mismatch (tried setting to installed version of typescript vs bundled 1.8.2)\n- Code with promises or callbacks (issue was produced in case with only console.log())\n- Breakpoint being on first line (breakpoints throughout entire code may fail)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\ntest.ts:\n\n``` typescript\nimport fs = require('fs');\nvar cb1 = function(err, stats) {\n    console.log('break here 1');\n};\nfs.stat('.', cb1);\n\nvar cb2 = function() {\n    console.log('break here 2');\n}\nsetTimeout(cb2, 1000);\n```\n\ntsconfig.json:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"es6\",\n        \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n        \"sourceMap\": true\n    }\n}\n```\n\nlaunch.json:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Attach\",\n            \"request\": \"attach\",\n            \"type\": \"node\",\n            \"port\": 5858,\n            \"sourceMaps\": true\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n1. tsc\n2. node --debug-brk test.js\n3. Set breakpoints in ts file and attach to process\n4. Commenting/uncommenting the top or bottom section and retrying causes the breakpoint issue to manifest eventually\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4717","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4717/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4717/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4717/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4717","id":144036210,"number":4717,"title":"OS

[edit: I’ve chosen `IViewlet` instead]\n- What is the best way to perform the HTML elements width measurement? [edit: I’ve found `DOM.getTotalWidth` and `DOM.getRelativeLeft`]\n- How do I get the current viewlet in `vs/workbench/layout.ts`? [edit: the [viewlet service](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/84a6e40d4356f747c8c3bc841d87d4edc254f7c4/src/vs/workbench/services/viewlet/common/viewletService.ts#L24)]\n- Where and how should I write some tests?\n\nThank you in advance for considering this contribution
