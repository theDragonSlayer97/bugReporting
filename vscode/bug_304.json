However, I can still manually start Electron from the command prompt, and it seems that the same command is what VSCODE is doing.\r\n\r\nI.e. this works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> d:\\wwwroot\\librarian2017\\dashboard/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd --debug-brk=24964 --nolazy main.js \r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I get the message (below) when I run launch.json, and the blue status bar at the bottom of the VSCODE window turns orange for a second and then goes back to blue.
