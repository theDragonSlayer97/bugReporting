everyone,\n\nI created a totally empty project and specified only CoreCLR as targetted framework; i.e., in `project.json` I have:\n\n```\n\"frameworks\": {\n    \"dnxcore50\": {}\n}\n```\n\nOn my PC, the dnvm confirugration is the following:\n\n```\nActive Version           Runtime Architecture OperatingSystem Alias\n------ -------           ------- ------------ --------------- -----\n       1.0.0-rc1-update1 clr     x64          win\n       1.0.0-rc1-update1 clr     x86          win\n  *    1.0.0-rc1-update1 coreclr x64          win             default\n       1.0.0-rc1-update1 coreclr x86          win\n```\n\nStill, when I run the application I receive:\n\n```\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: The current runtime target framework is not compatible with 'SomeProject'.\nCurrent runtime target framework: 'DNX,Version=v4.5.1 (dnx451)'\n Version:      1.0.0-rc1-16231\n Type:         Clr\n Architecture: x86\n OS Name:      Windows\n OS Version:   10.0\n Runtime Id:   win10-x86\n\nPlease make sure the runtime matches a framework specified in project.json\n```\n\nVisual Studio Code is still \"thinking\" that it should run x86 CLR DNX and not the x64 CoreCLR one.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a Visual Studio Code issue, or ASP.Net Core tooling issue; and appreciate any hint and help.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3488","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3488/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3488/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3488/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3488","id":136667037,"number":3488,"title":"Compat
