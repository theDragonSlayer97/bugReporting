VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: macOS\n### Desired behavior\n\nWhen you use Quick Open (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) to open a file, that file should stay open (i.e. it shouldn't be a preview tab).\n### Current behavior\n\nCurrent behavior opens it as a preview tab, which can be undesirable.  If you open a lot of files up front through quick open, you have to double click the tab or run command \"Keep Open\" for each file.  It makes it very slow to open a lot of files from Quick Open.\n\n![sep-09-2016 10-42-30](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11839736/18396775/2bd6b2f4-767a-11e6-8ab7-540aa0be74a1.gif)\n\nSince some people may want to rapidly preview a lot of files, then we should do what Sublime does in their version of Quick Open: upon keyboard focus or hover of any file in Quick Open, a preview tab is shown.  Only when you press Enter or click does it keep it as an editor and close the Quick Open.\n\nIf we click away from or press <kbd>Esc</kbd>in Quick Open, then this preview tab would close, unless there already was a preview tab open before using Quick Open (in that case the previously previewed file would appear as if nothing had ever happened, so we don't leave a mess).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11788","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11788/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11788/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11788/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11788","id":176058483,"number":11788,"title":"Custom code completion does not show anymore","user":{"login":"buehler","id":1067213,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1067213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler","html_url":"https://github.com/buehler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":290465400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/api","name":"api","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-09-09T17:02:10Z","updated_at":"2016-09-12T07:31:55Z","closed_at":"2016-09-12T07:05:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.5.1\n- OS Version: OSX 10.11.6\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
