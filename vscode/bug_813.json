you help me find the right solution for the following scenario?\nI have an extension which is a custom compiler. The compiler executables come together with an extension and I would like the user to run my executable through tasks.json (so that he can get all the problem matcher support, default ctrl+shift+b experience, etc).\n\nThe problem is this - the executables in the tasks.json must be in the current PATH, so it will not find the files inside my extension installation folder. \nThe only viable solution as of now is to install the tools I need as another action (npm install, custom vscode command to install prerequisites, etc). But this is a bit sub-optimal, because a first-time user needs to do another action to install/update the tools and I need to have two different release processes - one for tools and one for extension itself.\n\nWould it be possible to do one of the following:\n- Run not only executables, but also vscode commands from tasks.json. For example, my extension registers a command called \"MyBuild\" and in tasks.json you specify something like {vscommand: 'MyBuild'; isBuildCommand: true}. Then it would be up to my extension to find and run the proper executable file in its installation path.\n- Patch PATH of the process at the extension activation time so that {command: 'mycompiler.exe'} would be resolved when running a task. Did not manage to make it work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11396/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11395","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11395/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11395/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11395/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11395","id":174532508,"number":11395,"title":"Cannot

not reliable and it has not worked for me. \n\nI have no intention of wasting anyone's time on this problem and this is why I spent so much time tweaking things, googling and I have come up with
