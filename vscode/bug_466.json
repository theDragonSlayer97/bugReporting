Environment:\r\n\r\nOS: Windows 7 Professional SP1 (VM under OSX)\r\nPython: ActiveState 2.7.5\r\n\r\nVS Code: 1.10.1 master release\r\nVisual Studio 15 Community \\ C++ Tools \\ SDK 8.1\r\nVS Code: 1.10.1 (Code OSS Build environment)\r\nVS Code Insiders 1.10.0 2-27 build: (Test environment)\r\nVS Code: master clone 2-28 and 3-1  date tests\r\n\r\nNode: 6.9.1\r\nNPM:  3.10.8\r\n\r\nDescription Of Bug:\r\n\r\nVCS does not search, download, install any extensions\r\nwith the extension wiget. Entering anything in the search bar\r\nresults in no extensions found.\r\n\r\nIf I manually copy an extension from the extension directory\r\nof VC code to the extension directory of .vscode-oss these\r\nextensions will show up , activate and function. Besides\r\nvscode-icons I also copied ftp-sync to test a network extension\r\nthis succeeded without problems. Still no ability to search download marketplace\r\n\r\nI have no proxy, working from home.  Looking at other posted issues\r\nthey seem similar but without the proxy involved.\r\nOther VSC release downloads have no similar problems with multiple\r\nCode release versions.\r\n\r\nInspecting the developer tools console output shows no errors.\r\nI have not gotten debugging of vscode  yet, so I have not\r\nbeen able to inspect and debug the code directly yet\r\n(anxious to do so).\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\ngit clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode\r\n.\\scripts\\npm install\r\n.\\scripts\\code\r\n(successful build - launches Code OSS Dev)\r\nView extensions\r\n(enter any search for an extension - no results)\r\n\r\nA successful package exhibits the same bug\r\n.\\node_modules\\.bin\\gulp vscode-win32\r\n\r\nmanually copied extensions appear in the widget\r\nand function (except for an update attempt)\r\n\r\nCheers

Look at minimap viewport\r\n2. ~~~Scroll to bottom of default settings~~~\r\n3. ~~~Scroll up enough so that the last section is not 100% still in view~~~\r\n4. ~~~Hover over minimap to display the viewport indicator, then repeat steps 3 & 4 at your leisure.~~~\r\n\r\nThe way the minimap handles the settings collapsed sections differently then that of 'code' collapsed sections and the inconsistency made it seem like it was a *bug* but its probably *working as design*.\r\n\r\nI don't know how the settings are structured in the backend but I presume that it is an aggregate view and the minimap viewport size is generated per source. As the source from 'code' is singular (example, user settings file), the size is singular. Since the settings are an aggregate and can take up a varying amount of space (due to collapsed state).\r\n\r\nI think that for a consistent user experience, the minimap viewport size should stay the same. \r\nSo the collapsed state shouldn't have any baring on that size. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"695\" alt=\"Minimap Scroll small\"
