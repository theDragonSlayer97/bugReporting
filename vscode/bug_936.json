With Terminal view open, click into terminal and type some keys, verify terminal is receiving keyboard input\n2. Using mouse, click into text editor\n3. Type keys and see that the first keyboard input goes to terminal and the rest are lost\n4.

Create a `.md` file with the following content:\n\n``` markdown\nHello\n\n<a name=\"custom-heading\"/>\n# Heading\n\nSome text\n```\n1. Open preview for the file\n2. Observe \"Heading\" and \"Some Text\" are blue and have anchor styling.\n\nWhile a self closing anchor tag isn't valid html, it's quite common to find them on Github, which seem to handle them correctly.
