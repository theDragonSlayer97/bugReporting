version 1.9\r\n\r\nIs there an official way to do this yet? For example given this settings.json and I want the `editor.rulers` setting for javascript:\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"editor.rulers\": [80],\r\n  \"[javascript]\": {\r\n    \"editor.rulers\": [100]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `workspace.getConfiguration('[javascript]') ... `doesn't seem to work.\r\n\r\nI've found that `workspace.getConfiguration().get('[javascript]')` will give me an object for the whole section, which I can work with, but I don't know if there's a better way.

VSCode Version: 1.9\r\n- OS Version: All.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Add a 4-byte UTF8 code point (e.g. 𐍈 or 𠜎 ) to a new file (e.g. C++).\r\n2. Delete it and put a breakpoint in an extension that handles the textDocument/didChange protocol (e.g. the C++ extension).\r\n\r\nBug: The result from VS Code is that TextDocumentContentChangeEvent rangeLength is 2, so our extension sees that the 1st character is correctly 4 bytes, but then it tries to process a non-existent 2nd character (crashing the process or corrupting data). Other APIs that pass the unexpected character position may also break functionality.\r\n\r\nIt seems like VS Code should make available the real character length of an edit so extensions can behavior correctly. VS Code reports the 4-byte code point as taking up 2 columns, which is consistent with the rangeLength of 2.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, we will assume that all 4-byte code points take up 2 characters and all other code points take up 1 character. Does that seem like a good workaround? I don't know for sure which UTF8 code points count as 2 or more characters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20169","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20169/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20169/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20169/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20169","id":206091602,"number":20169,"title":"Code formatting (\"Format Document\") got broken in  1.9.0","user":{"login":"roypardi","id":9053196,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9053196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roypardi","html_url":"https://github.com/roypardi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roypardi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roypardi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roypardi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roypardi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roypardi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roypardi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roypardi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roypardi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roypardi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-02-08T04:12:44Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T21:18:17Z","closed_at":"2017-02-08T19:07:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I updated to v 1.9.0 a few days ago and since then code formatting has been broken in html files which include javascript.\r\n\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version:  1.9.0 (1.9.0)\r\n- OS Version: OSX 10.11.6\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
