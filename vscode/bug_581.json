#10806\r\n\r\nAdds a new API for supporting  `go to implementation` type commands in languages. Implements an example for TS\r\n\r\nThe current approach added a new public interface called `ImplementationProvider` (a suggestions for a better name would be appreciated). This resulted in some duplicate code that I will try to clean up further. An alternate design would be to extend the `DefintionProvider` with an optional `provideImplemtnation` method. This would allow reusing our existing internal interfaces without as much duplication, but we may want to keep the two concepts separate. Please let me know if you have any thoughts one way or the other.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18345","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18345/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18345/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18345/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18345","id":199710941,"number":18345,"title":"How about support 'project' unit in VSCode?","user":{"login":"gseok","id":2108898,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2108898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gseok","html_url":"https://github.com/gseok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gseok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gseok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gseok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gseok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gseok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gseok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gseok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gseok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gseok/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-01-10T01:40:11Z","updated_at":"2017-01-11T00:45:40Z","closed_at":"2017-01-10T04:05:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"There is no plan of 'Project' unit support ?\r\nI Know..

Sometime, the VS Code debugger will hang when debugging a  PS script. I can't restart the debugger, but eventually, after pressing the stop button several times it will stop. However, pressing play results in a blue scrolling time line above the debug pane, and when I click stop this time I retrieve an error saying the debugger has crashed. \r\n\r\nDebug will not start until I have exited and restart Vs-code, but things to not stop there.  I threw together a simple test of some functions in an attempt to replicate an odd behaviour I was seeing through a pipeline (running the through the VS PS Debugger), and even more odd behaviours were seen, such as the Process block of the second function in the pipeline running before the process block on the first function. In another script I was also seeing other pipeline functions fire (and of course fail) when simply stepping over  a command in the current function (for example, a New-Item command to create a directory, or a '&' call out to another process. Even shutting down and restarting VS Code seem to do nothing.\r\n\r\nEventually I rebooted, but pretty sure this too too didn't do much either, until I change so code in `For Each-Object` loop, then eventually VS Code started behaving. \r\n\r\nIt was almost as it VS Code hadn't cleared some kind of internal stack and kept reverted to old path, or some such when the debugger was run.\r\n\r\nNot sure if you can understand what I'm explaining, or if I can replicate, but this has been going on an off for a while. If there are file I can provide, let me know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18343","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18343/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18343/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18343/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18343","id":199673011,"number":18343,"title":"ES6
