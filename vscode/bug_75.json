will disable command-links in the (deprecated) `MarkedString` and extension should use the new `MarkdownString` for command-links.\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nWhen using markdown-formatted content, VS Code supports \"links\" that invoke a command, like so: `[Hello](command:myExt.myCommand)`.  This is a powerful feature but has a security concern: With a carefully crafted document and an extension that creates a markdown-string from that content users can be tricked into clicking on what appears to be a link but actually executed a command. Consider the following sample:\r\n\r\n* I happen to know that you use an extension that includes potential dangers commands, e.g. running arbitrary commands in a shell\r\n* I make you use my library file that contains a jsdoc-comment invoking such a command via a command-link\r\n* While coding you get a hover saying \"click here for more info\" which in reality runs a command\r\n\r\n<img width=\"885\" alt=\"untitled\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1794099/30159447-e5ddbc62-93c8-11e7-8b0f-e014d51276c5.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nTo tackle this, we ask extensions to identify their markdown contents as trusted or not. E.g. TypeScript will say it don't trust markdown contents because it doesn't generate it, it just forwards. Other extensions, esp. those that generate command-links on purpose will mark their contents as trusted. To support that we have introduced a new type, `MarkdownString`. The `MarkdownString` can be used wherever the `MarkedString` can be used and when constructing it, you can say if you trust the contents, e.g.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// trusted\r\nconst md = new MarkdownString('[My Cool Feature](command:myTrustedContents)')\r\nmd.isTrusted = true;\r\n\r\n// not trusted\r\nnew MarkdownString(forgeinContentsLikeJsDoc)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33576","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33576/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33576/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33576/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33576","id":254263757,"number":33576,"title":"图尔问题","user":{"login":"mzcgithub","id":26833588,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/26833588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzcgithub","html_url":"https://github.com/mzcgithub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzcgithub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzcgithub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzcgithub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzcgithub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzcgithub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzcgithub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzcgithub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzcgithub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mzcgithub/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs

Hover over a CSS color and the color picker shows up, then move away and the picker goes away which is fine. \r\n2. Again do an hover over a CSS color again and this time start changing the color and if you have the misfortune of falling outside of the picker area, you lose the original color and your file is now dirty. The only way back is to do an undo (ctrl+z).

If you try Chrome for example, the picker stays open until you click away.

It isn't a requirement that the svg be on all 1 line for it to jump around, but that is the easiest way to reproduce it reliably.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open an svg file all collapsed to a single line of code (see svg below)\r\n2. :bug: Pressing end to jump to the end of the line, jumps to the end and then back to the start (press end 1 more time and it will work)\r\n3. :bug: Using the arrow keys from either the start or end, will keep causing it to jump to the beginning of the line\r\n\r\nHere is the svg in question -- it isn't always
