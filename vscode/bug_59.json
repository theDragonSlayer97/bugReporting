This would allow for more context sensitive titles/icons without having to resort to multiple commands. \r\n\r\nThere are multiple places in GitLens where I wished I had this ability (because often the multiple commands just isn't worth the extra complexity) -- where I want a different title for the command palette, editor context, etc, etc.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat similar to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32526 - @jrieken I think this could also address that one -- since you could just have the same command listed twice with a different title/icon based on the `when` clause\r\n\r\nHere is my ideal example below:\r\n```js\r\n\"commands\": [\r\n    {\r\n        \"command\": \"gitlens.stashSave\",\r\n        \"title\": \"Stash All Changes\",\r\n

}\r\n],\r\n\"menus\": {\r\n    \"commandPalette\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"command\": \"gitlens.stashSave\",\r\n            \"when\": \"gitlens:enabled\",\r\n            \"icon\": {\r\n                \"dark\": \"images/dark/icon-stash-all.svg\",\r\n                \"light\": \"images/light/icon-stash-all.svg\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"scm/resourceGroup/context\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"command\": \"gitlens.stashSave\",\r\n            \"when\": \"gitlens:enabled\",\r\n            \"title\": \"Stash Changed Files\"\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"scm/resourceState/context\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"command\": \"gitlens.stashSave\",\r\n            // listHasMultipleSelections of course doesn't exist today but it would be SO nice :)\r\n            \"when\": \"gitlens:enabled && !listHasMultipleSelections\",\r\n            \"title\": \"Stash File\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"command\": \"gitlens.stashSave\",\r\n            // listHasMultipleSelections of course doesn't exist today but it would be SO nice :)\r\n            \"when\": \"gitlens:enabled && listHasMultipleSelections\", \r\n            \"title\": \"Stash Files\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also included in this example `listHasMultipleSelections` (or something like it -- no selection, single selection, multiple selections would be ideal) that would be very helpful to have again to be more context-sensitive.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces

This is the way `vscode.workspace.textDocuments` work if I'm not mistaken.
