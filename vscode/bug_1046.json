from https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4035#issuecomment-197659811\nFrom @alefragnani \n\n---\n\nHi @alexandrudima , do you know if something has changed prior to 0.10.11 about it? \n\nI had an extension [Copy Word in Cursor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.copy-word) that is meant to replace the `Copy` and `Cut` commands when  there is no selection. It automatically selects the word where the cursor is, and copies/cuts to the clipboard, but I just noted that it is not working anymore :cry: . It detects and select the word, but when I call `vscode.commands.executeCommand(\"editor.action.clipboardCopyAction\");`, it does not respect the new selection, and the whole line is copied to the clipboard strangely, if I use the `clipboardCutAction` command, it _cuts_ the selected word, but the clipboard is filled with the entire line, again.\n\nI don't know if the commands itself changed, or if I have to do something else after updating the `selection`. The code is basically:\n\n``` TypeScript\n  const cursorWordRange = doc.getWordRangeAtPosition(selection.active);\n  var newSe = new vscode.Selection(cursorWordRange.start.line, cursorWordRange.start.character, cursorWordRange.end.line, cursorWordRange.end.character);\n  editor.selection = newSe;\n  vscode.commands.executeCommand(\"editor.action.clipboardCutAction\");\n\n```\n\nThanks for your help.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4392","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4392/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4392/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4392/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4392","id":141723079,"number":4392,"title":"[Extension] Getting message like : can't lint \"c:\\.<xyz.rb\" file , after installing ruby-linter extension.","user":{"login":"v-pavanp","id":17735796,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17735796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp","html_url":"https://github.com/v-pavanp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-17T22:30:04Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T06:39:05Z","closed_at":"2016-03-18T06:39:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:\n- OS Version:\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

VSCode Version: 0.10.11\n- OS Version: OS X 10.10.5\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. write a long line of text that wraps in the editor\n2. place the cursor on the first line and press Cmd-Option-Down (on OS X).\n\nThis creates a second cursor on the next visual line, which means it is somewhere on the same logical line depending on how the text is wrapped. When creating multiple cursors on adjacent lines, often it is to perform the same edit on multiple (logical) lines that are aligned with each other. The current behavior having the second cursor appear instead at some situation-specific place on the same logical line throws a wrench in this workflow. I can't think of a good situation where it makes sense (though I do realize it is consistent with pressing the down arrow without cmd-option)\n\nDefinitions: a logical line is a line in the file on disk. A visual line is a line in the editor. A logical line may span multiple visual lines when there is wrapping.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4374","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4374/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4374/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4374/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4374","id":141621120,"number":4374,"title":"Formatter
