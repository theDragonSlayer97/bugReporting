VSCode Version:\r\n1.11.2\r\n- OS Version:\r\nany\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI'm trying to make a launch configuration that will start debugging the currently-opened TypeScript file using [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava#debugging)\r\nRight now I can't, because you need to pass it args a bit like this in `launch.json`:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/ava/profile.js\",\r\n    \"args\": [\"${workspaceRoot}/path/to/my/file.js\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if you want to run the currently opened test file, you'd use something like:\r\n`\"args\": [\"${workspaceRoot}/${relativeFile}\"]`\r\n\r\nWhich works fine if you're writing plain JavaScript, because ava will be able to run it directly. But if you're using TypeScript, ava will try to interpret the TypeScript as JavaScript and will barf.\r\n\r\nIf we had `relativeFileNoExtension`, it'd be pretty easy to make a configuration that ran the current file:\r\n`\"args\": [\"${workspaceRoot}/dist/${relativeFileNoExtension}.js\"]`\r\n\r\nFor example, if I have `foo/bar/tests/mytestfile.ts` open, we'd have `relativeFileNoExtension` being `foo/bar/tests/mytestfile` and the arg would be `/path/to/my/workspace/dist/foo/bar/tests/mytestfile.js`, which matches the JavaScript output from `tsc`.\r\nwhere `dist` is the `outDir` in `tsconfig.json` - obviously this part is project-specific.\r\n\r\nI'd imagine the implementation would be something like this in [configurationResolveService](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/d4504b92f466a2882931513fde34a610170557d6/src/vs/workbench/services/configurationResolver/node/configurationResolverService.ts):\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\nprivate get relativeFileNoExtension(): string {\r\n    const relativeFile = this.relativeFile();\r\n    return relativeFile.slice(0, relativeFile.length - paths.extname(relativeFile).length);\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25785","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25785/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25785/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25785/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25785","id":225735498,"number":25785,"title":"Maintain scroll position for content provided by TextDocumentContentProvider","user":{"login":"eamodio","id":641685,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/641685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio","html_url":"https://github.com/eamodio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamodio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-05-02T15:40:13Z","updated_at":"2017-05-05T11:51:08Z","closed_at":"2017-05-05T11:51:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.12.0-insider (aa05dac84b7526550653a861c17b402349cb3bc6, 2017-05-02T00:11:45.176Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.16184\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen switching tabs, content provided by a `TextDocumentContentProvider` resets the scroll position to the first line.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

See the package.json included below.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is an issue with how the `tslint` module can load the `typescript` module it requires. To describe the issue, let me first explain the setup, when the language server plugin is installed into a workspace using `npm install tslint typescript tslint-language-service`. This results in the following module layout inside the `node_modules` folder.\r\n```\r\nnode_modules\r\n   tslint\r\n   tslint-language-service\r\n   typescript\r\n```\r\nNotice that the typescript module is a peer to the tslint module and the `tslint` module can require the `typescript` module. This is the _same_ typescript module that is used by vscode's typescript server.\r\n\r\nNow, the question is what dependencies should be defined for the vscode tslint extension? To make the extension work I had to include `typescript` as a dependency otherwise `tslint` cannot find the `typescript` module and the `tslint-language-service` plugin does not load. Since the existing tslint rules import `typescript` they need to get at a typescript module. This is the error message when the typescript module is not bundled.\r\n\r\n```\r\nInfo 11   Loading tslint-language-service from c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft VS Code Insiders\\resources\\app\\extensions\\node_modules\\typescript\\lib\\tsserver.js/../../.. (resolved to c:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft VS Code Insiders/resources/app/extensions/node_modules/node_modules)\r\nInfo 12   Failed to load module: {}\r\nInfo 13   Loading tslint-language-service from C:\\Users\\egamma\\.vscode-insiders\\extensions\\eg2.vscode-ts-tslint-0.0.1 (resolved to C:/Users/egamma/.vscode-insiders/extensions/eg2.vscode-ts-tslint-0.0.1/node_modules)\r\nInfo 14   Failed to load module: {\"code\":\"MODULE_NOT_FOUND\"}\r\nInfo 15   Couldn't find tslint-language-service anywhere in paths: c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft VS Code Insiders\\resources\\app\\extensions\\node_modules\\typescript\\lib\\tsserver.js/../../..,C:\\Users\\egamma\\.vscode-insiders\\extensions\\eg2.vscode-ts-tslint-0.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the `tslint` module should use the same `typescript` module that is used by the vscode typescript server and not include yet another one. This results in loading two versions (!) of the typescript module into the language server. \r\n\r\nOne idea would be that the TS language server tweaks the node require path, so that the typescript module used by the language server is found when a tslint rule requires `typescript`.\r\n\r\n`package.json`\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"name\": \"vscode-ts-tslint\",\r\n    \"displayName\":

Only 1 `\"` gets added\r\n\r\nOur language AL https://github.com/Microsoft/AL has a concept of identifiers which are any lexem which is surrounded by `\"`s. When you type `\"` we start providing completion for it but if the `\"` isn't closed then we think it's an unclosed identifier (which it technically is) and we swallow the rest of the line with the replacement.\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n1. Type: `field(MyField;Source) {}`\r\n2. Select `Source`\r\n3. Press `\"` (`Source` doesn't get surrounded with `\"`s because we do not wan't that\r\n4. Type `Customer L`\r\n5.
