Would be great to get the \n- `CommonEditorRegistry` \n- in general get injectables from monaco\n\nThanks for all your great work.

keybindings that call `cursorHome` (which calls `getColumnAtBeginningOfLine`), I expect to go to the beginning of the line, but what happens is I end up at the first non-whitespace position OR the beginning, depending on where I last was (it alternates).\n\nTo me, this makes certain things more difficult.  For example clean multi-line selection/cut/paste using the keyboard becomes tedious when the selection accidentally starts indented rather than at col 1.\n- Is there a simple fix I can just make in my keybindings? **(Preferred, but I couldn't figure out a way)**\n- If not, should there be a new \"cursorCol1\" command or similar?\n- Or should the getColumnAtBeginningOfLine just be avoided and always return 1?\n- Or is there wisdom behind the way it works that I'm

If you wait a little after selection, the problem does not happen.\n\nSample:\n\n![gif](http://d.ekin.io/17Ge0+)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7227","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7227/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7227/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7227/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7227","id":158556612,"number":7227,"title":"[question] windows installer","user":{"login":"farfromrefug","id":655344,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/655344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/farfromrefug","html_url":"https://github.com/farfromrefug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farfromrefug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farfromrefug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farfromrefug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farfromrefug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farfromrefug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farfromrefug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farfromrefug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farfromrefug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farfromrefug/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-06-05T14:20:56Z","updated_at":"2016-06-06T08:49:07Z","closed_at":"2016-06-06T08:10:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am sorry to ask this here as it is not really a VSCode issue, but i think it can be useful to the whole Electron community.\nMy question is how did you manage to have such a small windows installer?

The link describes all details how Path mapping works. Please review it.\n\nSo here is copy of Example 1 from Microsoft/TypeScript#5039\n\n```\nprojectRoot\n├── folder1\n│   └── file1.ts (imports 'folder2/file2')\n├── folder2\n│   ├── file2.ts (imports './file3')\n│   └── file3.ts\n└── tsconfig.json\n```\n\nExpected behavior is to support 'folder2/file' imports without Errors & Warnings, list classes of module and support Intellisense - in short: normal behavior, as it would be, if imported using relative paths.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12189125/15805862/23ed829e-2b47-11e6-902e-8816f443064f.png)\n\n```\nexport class LocalModuleClass\n{\n  public title: string = \"Title from local-module!!!\";\n}\n```\n\nTypeScript itself, compiles and builds everything as expected, application works.\n\nHere is [demo rep](https://github.com/davidgabrichidze/vscode-paths-example). It uses [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). Instructions to run app:\n`npm install angular-cli -g`\n`npm install`\n`ng build`\n`ng
