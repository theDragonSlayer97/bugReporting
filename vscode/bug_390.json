Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.11.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Have a similar code in place (can't put the original one here)\r\n```ts\r\nnamespace A1 {\r\n    export abstract class A extends B {\r\n        public abstract el1: Object;\r\n        private _el2: string;\r\n        public get el2(): string { return this._el2; };\r\n        private _el3: number;\r\n        public get el3(): number { return this._el3; };\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nnamespace A2 {\r\n   export class APlus extends class A1.A {\r\n        public el1: Object = { foo:bar }\r\n        public baz: X;\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Start to debug and instantiate a new object APlus.\r\n3. On the debug window you'll see: **el1, _el2, el2, el3, baz** but you won't see **_el3**.\r\n\r\nMy debug configuration is the following:\r\n```\r\n   {\r\n            \"type\": \"node\",\r\n            \"protocol\": \"inspector\",\r\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n            \"name\": \"Local\",\r\n            \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/protractor/bin/protractor\",\r\n            \"args\": [\"${workspaceRoot}/protractor.conf.js\", \"--troubleshoot\"],\r\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\r\n            \"sourceMaps\": true,\r\n            \"runtimeArgs\": [\r\n                \"--harmony\", \"--expose_debug_as=v8debug\"//, \"--trace-warnings\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"skipFiles\": [\r\n                \"<node_internals>/**/*.js\",\r\n                \"node_modules/selenium-webdriver/**/webdriver.js\",\r\n                \"node_modules/protractor/**/browser.js\"\r\n            ]\r\n        },\r\n```\r\n\r\nPS: I need to explicitly state the protocol as **inspector** (even though I use Node 7.8.0) because since 1.11.0 VS Code will launch the tests in **legacy** if I set it as **protocol:auto**\r\n\r\nPS2: Don't know if this will help, but in the case where this is implemented if I check the __proto__ element, then I can only see el2 and el3 (and both state TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24093","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24093/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24093/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24093/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24093","id":219957719,"number":24093,"title":"feature
