Type `Object o = new O`(+`ctrl+space`) to get autocompletion for the contructor `Object()`\r\n3. select `Object()` and  press `Enter`\r\n\r\nThe inserted text is `O()`, instead of `Object()`.

Moreover, it seems the Orion IDE, using the same Java server, is not affected. Which makes me think this is definitely a vscode issue.\r\n\r\nA second bug can be seen on the screencast, which could be a side-effect of this issue: after the proposals are displayed, typing the next letter to narrow down the selection actually deselect the 1st `Object()` proposal, only the new letter is highlighted. If it's unrelated, I'll open another issue. \r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues/143\r\n\r\n cc
