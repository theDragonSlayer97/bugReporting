indent rulers similar to what's used in other editors ([see this screenshot](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3803#issuecomment-195682393)).\n\nThis should be a setting that is on by default but that can be disabled in settings.json.\n\nPerhaps we can call it `\"editor.indentGuides:\" true`\n\nVertical tab rulers should show for each tab level in (also include position 0 within nested section of code, such as classes, functions, Html tag nesting etc...)\n\nAddresses issue #3803.  Some users have trouble not knowing where the left edge of the code editor is.  This is partly because the code editor and the glyph margin is not visually separated. This is particularly a problem for users who use small tab sizes (such as 2 spaces).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4278/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4277","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4277/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4277/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4277/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4277","id":141086067,"number":4277,"title":"[Localization] Extensions icon hover tooltip not localized","user":{"login":"vsccarl","id":12900364,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12900364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl","html_url":"https://github.com/vsccarl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291057332,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/verified","name":"verified","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-15T20:14:00Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T11:49:22Z","closed_at":"2016-03-16T09:16:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 0.10.12-alpha --locale=fr (or any locale)\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

So giving options like 'Create jsconfig.json', 'Later', 'Never' would make a nicer TS experience\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4249","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4249/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4249/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4249/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4249","id":140969076,"number":4249,"title":"Hover message needs to be concise","user":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":329225874,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/polish","name":"polish","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-15T13:17:08Z","updated_at":"2016-03-16T13:44:08Z","closed_at":"2016-03-16T13:43:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Related to #4007\n- VSCode Version:\n- OS Version: Linux\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
