VSCode Version: 1.8.1\r\n- OS Version: Arch Linux (kernel v4.8.8)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Trigger any HTTP request when running the web application I'm working on (sorry, it isn't open source, so I realize that doesn't help a great deal)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that when I do this, vscode immediately jumps to 100% CPU on one core, and stays there for about 30 seconds before returning to normal. Naturally, this cuts the battery life of my laptop pretty dramatically, to the extent that I am not willing to make vscode my primary editor.\r\n![vscode using 100 cpu](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3988775/21951406/c1379aae-d9d3-11e6-8ac5-8767c9fe7a74.png)\r\n\r\nOddly, it is a `code` process that spikes, but performance while using the application does not seem to be affected. At first I thought it might be reindexing files (due to adding a rendered view file or some such), but I tried adding and editing test files, and neither produced the same result (doesn't rule it out, just makes it less a likely suspect in my mind). I have also tried opening it via `code --disable-extensions`, and I still have the same issue, so it's not an extension that's causing the problem.\r\n\r\nHere are a few details about my project that might help narrow it down:\r\n- this is a large application (hundreds of thousands of files)\r\n- we use PHP (Laravel) for the back-end, and we're in the process of transitioning to Angular 2 in TypeScript (from an awkward mish-mash of Angular 1, Knockout, and some other stuff that we wrote ourselves in CoffeeScript)\r\n- we use gulp, webpack, npm, and websockets (to name a few more technologies that might be relevant)\r\n\r\nTo make this even more of a challenge, none of my three coworkers who are using vscode for this project are experiencing this issue, despite having very similar setups. At this point I don't have much hope of there being a clear solution, but I wanted to log this so that if anyone else experiences it, they may be able to add more info that would help diagnose it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18537","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18537/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18537/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18537/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18537","id":200773826,"number":18537,"title":"Trying

Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.8.1\r\n- OS Version: Win 10 64-bit\r\n\r\n# Overview: \r\nHaving filename first (rather than folder) in window title bar title makes switching between multiple instances more difficult.\r\n\r\n# Abstract: \r\nLike many developers, I usually have at least 2-3 (often many more) project folders (i.e. code instances) open at the same time, and switch between them. Currently, the window title for each instance is set as follows (at least in Windows version):\r\n[file name] - [folder name] - Visual Studio Code\r\n\r\nThe problem is that one may be editing a file called 'settings.json' in multiple projects at the same time, making it difficult to quickly discern which tile or thumbnail represents which project when using alt-tab or windows taskbar hover tiles. And if the file name is very long, the folder name may not be visibile at all.\r\n\r\nIf the folder name were first, it would be much more immediately apparent which tile/thumbnail was which project instance.\r\n\r\n# Concerns: \r\nWhile I believe that this would be a simple change programmatically, I must admit I have no idea how this would impact my friends on other platforms since I only use Windows. Perhaps someone familiar with the OSx or Linux versions could share their thoughts on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18525","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18525/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18525/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18525/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18525","id":200704159,"number":18525,"title":"generate type fix does not work","user":{"login":"five70apps","id":4247685,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4247685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/five70apps","html_url":"https://github.com/five70apps","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/five70apps/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/five70apps/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/five70apps/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/five70apps/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/five70apps/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/five70apps/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/five70apps/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/five70apps/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/five70apps/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":409283388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/caused-by-extension","name":"caused-by-extension","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-13T18:58:51Z","updated_at":"2017-01-13T19:04:00Z","closed_at":"2017-01-13T19:04:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.8.1 (ee428b0eead68bf0fb99ab5fdc4439be227b6281, 2016-12-19T14:49:23.350Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\r\n- Extensions:\r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|csharp|ms-vscode|1.6.2|\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
