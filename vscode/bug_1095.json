So I've set up my `tasks.json` to the following\n\n```\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"command\": \"cmd\", \n    \"isShellCommand\": true,\n    \"showOutput\": \"silent\",\n    \"args\": [\"/C\"],\n\n    \"tasks\": [\n        {\n        \"taskName\": \"Build\",\n        \"suppressTaskName\": true,\n        \"isBuildCommand\": true,\n        \"args\": [\"${cwd}/make.bat\"]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nAnd my `make.bat` consists of:\n\n```\n@echo off\necho Building...\necho Done!\nchoice /C YN /T 10 /D Y /M \"Window will close in 10 seconds...\"\nIF %ERRORLEVEL% == 2 PAUSE\n```\n\nWhich works fine in normal execution:\n\n```\nBuilding...\nDone!\nWindow will close in 10 seconds... [Y,N]?Y\n```\n\nBut through tasks the last prompt never executes. Script continues forever and nothing gets printed to Output in VSCode. Same goes for if a script ends with a `PAUSE`. Nothing gets printed and script runs until you terminate it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2920","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2920/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2920/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2920/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2920","id":132909933,"number":2920,"title":"Misleading error message","user":{"login":"mikekidder","id":41694,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/41694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikekidder","html_url":"https://github.com/mikekidder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikekidder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikekidder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikekidder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikekidder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikekidder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikekidder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikekidder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikekidder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikekidder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"egamma","id":172399,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/172399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma","html_url":"https://github.com/egamma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"egamma","id":172399,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/172399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma","html_url":"https://github.com/egamma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-02-11T07:45:51Z","updated_at":"2016-02-11T14:49:16Z","closed_at":"2016-02-11T14:49:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Testing a project [redux-saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga) with neither a jsconfig.json or tsconfig.json.
