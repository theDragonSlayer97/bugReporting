Open a Python file with the single line ```print(\"Hello, world\")```\r\n2. Right click on the file and select \"Run Python file in terminal\"\r\n\r\nThe following output appears in the terminal window:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWindows PowerShell\r\nCopyright (C) 2015 Microsoft Corporation.

But it does seem that the action is failing to format the shell command in a way that Powershell can execute (an initial ```&``` is needed as the executable name is quoted).\r\n\r\nMy settings file includes the following:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n// Place your settings in this file to overwrite the default settings\r\n{\r\n  // Customizes which terminal to run on Windows.\r\n  \"terminal.integrated.shell.windows\": \"C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\sysnative\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell.exe\",\r\n  //\"python.pythonPath\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\UK03306\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Python\\\\Python36\\\\python.exe\"\r\n  \"python.pythonPath\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\py.exe\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that the \"Run Python file in terminal\" command isn't taking into account the possibility that the default shell is not ```cmd.exe```. Removing my custom ```terminal.integrated.shell.windows``` allows \"Run Python file...\" to work, but I do *not* consider that to be an acceptable solution here, as it would affect the behaviour of ```Ctrl-Shift-'``` (Create New Integrated Terminal).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20046","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20046/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20046/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20046/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20046","id":205592419,"number":20046,"title":"[win]

collectValueCompletions(resource: string, location: JSONPath, currentKey: string, result: CompletionsCollector): Thenable<any> {\r\n    if (this.isSettingsFile(resource) && location.length === 1 &&
