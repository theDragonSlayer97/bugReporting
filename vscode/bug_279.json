You can't change for example the terminal reveal or echo behavior)\r\n\r\n### Add configured task\r\n\r\n- add another task to the tasks.json that is not contributed by an extension.

With bazel, it's common to have very large projects, so users often open subdirectories in VSCode, instead of the project root. bazel still prints all messages relative to its workspace root though. For example, given the source tree:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmy/\r\n  BUILD\r\n  WORKSPACE\r\n  foo.ts\r\n  project/\r\n    BUILD\r\n    bar.ts\r\n    subdir/\r\n      baz.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsers might open `my/project/` in VSCode (as the workspace location). Now running `bazel build` with a working directory of `my/project`, it'll print errors such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfoo.ts(123): error here\r\nproject/subdir/baz.ts(456): another error here\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that paths are relative to the workspace root (`my/` above, the directory containing the WORKSPACE file). `problemMatcher` supports paths relative to the directory opened in VSCode and absolute paths, but AFAICT not paths relative to some parent folder.\r\n\r\nI guess this is hard to support in a configuration file format. Maybe it'd be easier if there was an API for an extension to contribute problem matchers (and tasks, for that matter)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27426","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27426/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27426/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27426/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27426","id":231982760,"number":27426,"title":"Add

Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: Version 1.12.2 (1.12.2) \r\n  `19222cdc84ce72202478ba1cec5cb557b71163de`\r\n- OS Version: macOS Sierra 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Creates a YAML file, with some french text, make sure it is saved it as utf8\r\n\r\n    ```yaml\r\n    property:\r\n      summary: \"Spécifications Swagger\"\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Make sure the default encoding is utf8 in the `settings.json`\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n        \"files.autoGuessEncoding\": true,\r\n        \"files.encoding\": \"utf8\",\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. Reopen the file, guessed encoding is Windows 1252. Another side effect is that the line with accents is marked as modified as soon as the file is opened\r\n\r\n    ```yaml\r\n    prop:\r\n      summary: \"SpÃ©cifications Swagger\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nThe only workaround is to reopen the file with a different encoding, which is cumbersome when you work with a load of files.\r\n\r\nIf the same text, encoded as `UTF-8`, is saved in other file extensions, reopening this file show guesses with different encodings, like ISO-8859-2.\r\n\r\nI have files with different encoding, so I'd like _vscode_ to guess from content, but here _vscode_ zealously try other encodings while UTF-8 works and is the default encoding.
