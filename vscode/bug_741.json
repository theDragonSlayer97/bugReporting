VSCode Version:\n  `1.5.1`\n- OS Version:\n  `Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393]`\n\nDefault `Dark+`/`Light+` themes provide very basic highlighting (even though they're called `+`),\nI scrolled through the issues and you guys always seem to say that current philosophy is to provide only declaration highlighting and stuff, that is fair enough when it comes to _default_ themes.\n\nBut what if we (the community) want to create more advanced themes supporting highlighting of fields, method calls, static classes, string interpolations, enum values, assignments and so on. Where do we get scope lists for those? I tried to use various scope hunters with `Sublime Text` but none of the \"hunted down\" scopes actually worked which made me think scopes generated for `vscode` are different.\n\nI know you try to create language agnostic themes, but that does not mean the community cannot create advanced (language-specific) themes, e.g. something like `VS Dark` + `ReSharper` \"Color Identifiers\" for `C#`\n\nUsing \"Color Identifiers\" with `ReSharper` has proven to be very effective in catching bugs and understanding code faster and easier since you have many more visuals and process information way faster\n\nTo give an example, right now I have these `ReSharper` provided extra identifiers colored:\n\n```\n<Item Name=\"ReSharper Constant Identifier\" Foreground=\"0x00AA7698\" Background=\"0x01000001\" BoldFont=\"No\"/>\n<Item Name=\"ReSharper Field Identifier\" Foreground=\"0x00A57393\" Background=\"0x01000001\" BoldFont=\"No\"/>\n<Item Name=\"ReSharper Method Identifier\" Foreground=\"0x00A3B3C4\" Background=\"0x01000001\" BoldFont=\"No\"/>\n<Item Name=\"ReSharper Extension Method Identifier\" Foreground=\"0x00A3B3C4\" Background=\"0x01000001\" BoldFont=\"No\"/>\n<Item Name=\"ReSharper Operator Identifier\" Foreground=\"0x00C4BBA9\" Background=\"0x01000001\" BoldFont=\"No\"/>\n<Item Name=\"ReSharper Class Identifier\" Foreground=\"0x00A59A76\" Background=\"0x01000001\" BoldFont=\"No\"/>\n<Item Name=\"ReSharper Interface Identifier\" Foreground=\"0x00989521\" Background=\"0x01000001\" BoldFont=\"No\"/>\n<Item Name=\"ReSharper Struct Identifier\" Foreground=\"0x00A59A76\" Background=\"0x01000001\" BoldFont=\"No\"/>\n<Item Name=\"ReSharper Enum Identifier\" Foreground=\"0x00A59A76\" Background=\"0x01000001\" BoldFont=\"No\"/>\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13555","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13555/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13555/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13555/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13555","id":182413419,"number":13555,"title":"I'm unable to watch variables in visual studio code when working on csharp","user":{"login":"djbreen7","id":13296622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13296622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djbreen7","html_url":"https://github.com/djbreen7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djbreen7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djbreen7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djbreen7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djbreen7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djbreen7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djbreen7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djbreen7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djbreen7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djbreen7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":409283388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/caused-by-extension","name":"caused-by-extension","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-10-12T01:29:29Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T15:16:31Z","closed_at":"2016-10-12T08:07:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm unable to watch variables in visual studio code when working on csharp\n\n**Error CS1525: Invalid expression term '<term>'**\n- VSCode Version: Code 1.6.0 (e52fb0bc87e6f5c8f144e172639891d8d8c9aa55, 2016-10-10T18:37:40.189Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\n- Extensions: ms-vscode.csharp-1.4.1, ms-vscode.mono-debug-0.11.0, ms-vscode.PowerShell-0.7.2\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

bug against yarn (https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/744), this still seems to work fine on with `./scripts/npm.sh`, perhaps because the exact commit is specified in `npm-shrinkwrap.json`\n- I did a quick sanity test of vscode built using yarn and it seems fine.\n- Tested only Ubuntu 16.04 with command `./scripts/yarn.sh install

empty document well animations (infinity icon motion, text fade in) make the tool feel slow, as if it can't keep up with me resizing the window.  If i make the windows smaller, the text disappears and then the icon catches up with me.  When i make the window larger, the icon motion is behind my resizing gesture, and eventually the text fades in.\n\nAll of these visuals happen after i make a resize gesture, which makes me feel like the tool can't keep up, like something is happening in the background, and I should wait for it.  it is distracting too, it always catches my eye and then I lose my context.\n\nVS Code is lightweight and fast. The UI should feel snappy, not delayed. We don't animate in search results or when we open a file.  Quick Open is instantaneous.  Async queries in the Extensions viewlet show me a progress bar immediately.   Why then does our desktop resize animate behind my gestures?\n\nCC @bgashler1 @seanmcbreen @stevencl @chrmarti @joaomoreno \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13529/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13528","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13528/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13528/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13528/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13528","id":182326996,"number":13528,"title":"Lightbulb doesn't open when editor.action.quickFix is executed in current insider build","user":{"login":"Wosi","id":3448684,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3448684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi","html_url":"https://github.com/Wosi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wosi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-10-11T17:37:32Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T11:01:59Z","closed_at":"2016-10-13T11:01:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In the current insider build the lightbulb appears left of the line number.
