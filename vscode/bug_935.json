VSCode Version: 1.3.0-insider\n- OS Version: Mac OSX (macOS 😉) 10.11.5\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Reference one JSON schema from another. Please note that I'm **not** talking about referencing a JSON schema for a given JSON document, but schema-to-schema.\n2. Observe that the validation fails because the validation treats the reference as url and tries to load schema using HTTP\n\nSmall example: imagine a `schema1.json` and `schema2.json` as well as `document1.json` and `document2.json`.\n\n`document1.json` is associated to `schema1.json` through `json.schemas` association in `.vscode/settings.json` (this should be irrelevant), similar for `...2.json` doc/schema.\n\n`schema1.json` has a definition called `mydef`. Using this from `document1.json` works fine.\n\nNow I'm trying to reuse definitions from `schema1.json` in `schema2.json` so that when I validate `document2.json` everything works.\n\nIn order to do so, I make a `$ref` like so:\n\n`\"$ref\": \"./schema1.json#definitions/mydef\"`\n\nHowever, validator fails on the first opening curly brace in the file, saying the following:\n\n```\nProblems loading reference './schema1.json#definitions/mydef': Unable to load schema from './schema1.json': Unable to to connect to ./schema1.json. Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:80\n```\n\nTried using `file://` protocol with no success (I guess file protocol is meant for absolute references which is out of the question since a developer can clone source repo anywhere on any machine). It basically says `//schema1.json not found` (when simply using `file://schema1.json#...`).\n\nAm I missing something or is this not supported? If so, are there any workarounds?

(ie. I can't use keyboard to rapidly go through the results, opening them for context, and then moving on to next one in the list)\n\nSuggestion: all user to press spacebar when on a search result to have the system open the search result in the file panel but _not_ change focus over to the file panel.\n\nThis would keep the action consistent with using spacebar to expand/contract fille results and would allow the user to still use enter to jump into it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7720","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7720/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7720/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7720/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7720","id":160425191,"number":7720,"title":"Weird snippets suggested before obvious ones","user":{"login":"Arrow7000","id":13225609,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13225609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arrow7000","html_url":"https://github.com/Arrow7000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arrow7000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arrow7000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arrow7000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arrow7000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arrow7000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arrow7000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arrow7000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arrow7000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arrow7000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-06-15T13:42:20Z","updated_at":"2016-06-17T09:47:40Z","closed_at":"2016-06-16T11:46:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.21\n- OS Version: Windows 7 Professional\n\nWhen editing JavaScript files in my project and I want to use the built in snippets like `for` and `console.log`, VSCode suggests a ton of snippets, but none of the ones I want.

PR is the start to implement #3192 by allowing extensions to add primary and secondary actions to the editor action bar. The approach we take will also allow to add action in other places, like viewlets or context menus. \n\nThe current thinking goes like this: In the `commands` contribution point will get an additional `context` property (better name to be found) that allows to define _where_ to show the command under _what_ condition.\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"command\": \"v.sayHello\",\n    \"title\": \"Hello World\",\n    \"icon\": \"./media/Preview.svg\",\n    \"context\": {\n        \"where\": \"editor/primary\",\n        \"when\": \"typescript\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe sample above makes the command show up in the primary editor tool bar when it shows a typescript file. The `path` will be a finite enumeration of locations, like `editor/primary`, `editor/secondary`, `explorer/primary` etc. The `when` condition is the trustworthy [DocumentSelector](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/joh/menus/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L1431) always being applied on an Uri.\n\nThe **big** concern is UI scalability wrt the amount of actions/menu entries accumulating over time. I don't think being restrictive is the right approach but we should give users the change to customise menus like we allow to customise keybindings. Customisation from extensions should be treated as _proposed_ customisation which the user accepts or denies. Analog to keybindings, there should be a file like `menus.json` which allows to manually change the menu layout.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7704/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4428","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"CB2F:366F:CC41C4:18F1E19:59D94450","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=936>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=934>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"0b5887cd8257cae134098b40ecde442b\"","status":"200 OK"}}
