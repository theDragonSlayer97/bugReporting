I use mixins to write styles the BEM method. And I get such 2 bugs with emmet. The first is that if @include emmet is below the input line, it stops showing matches. The second when I write ovh I press tab, and then cmd + z then also the match will not seem any more. In other editors, I did not observe this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7513945/29405216-fa35e524-8345-11e7-853a-48daa9303a25.gif)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32703/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32702","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32702/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32702/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32702/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32702","id":250877204,"number":32702,"title":"emmet.extensionsPath doesnt work","user":{"login":"anyclub","id":19922265,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19922265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyclub","html_url":"https://github.com/anyclub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyclub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyclub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyclub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyclub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyclub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyclub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyclub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyclub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyclub/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"ramya-rao-a","id":16890566,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16890566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a","html_url":"https://github.com/ramya-rao-a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ramya-rao-a","id":16890566,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16890566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a","html_url":"https://github.com/ramya-rao-a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-17T09:09:42Z","updated_at":"2017-08-17T15:51:23Z","closed_at":"2017-08-17T15:51:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--Do you have a question?
