Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\nI recently tried VS Code as I no longer want to pay for Webstorm. I want to gradually migrate my existing Meteor (i.e. JavaScript) project to TypeScript. Thus, I need a mixed setup that allows for `js` as well as `ts` files. As long as I don't add a `tsconfig.json` file, everything works as expected (at least as far as I can tell). I'm gonna use a Meteor package to do the TypeScript compiling, so all I want from VS Code is Syntax Checks, Auto Complete and Intellisense. I don't need VS Code to do any compilations. But I still need a `tsconfig.json` file to configure the Meteor TypeScript compiler. And also I can't get VS Code to recognize typings for Meteor. I was hoping I could use `tsconfig.json` to point VS Code to those type definitions. But one after the other...\r\n\r\nSyntax Checking, Autocomplete and Intellisense working (without `tsconfig.json`):\r\n![index ts - admin - visual studio code_005](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11458212/22061639/28ee5796-dd76-11e6-8dae-a8dbc2e3be5b.png)\r\n\r\nThen I add an empty `tsconfig.json`, which is [permitted](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html). What happens is that instantly there is no more Syntax Checking, Autocomplete and Intellisense in `js` as well as `ts` files. Forcing suggestions with `Ctrl + Space` just gives this:\r\n![index ts - admin - visual studio code_006](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11458212/22061747/abefeee8-dd76-11e6-9bbc-969af71a79ca.png)\r\n\r\nRelaunching VS Code makes no difference. Interestingly, suggestions do still work inside of `tsconfig.json`:\r\n![tsconfig json - admin - visual studio code_007](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11458212/22061853/22d92bb4-dd77-11e6-8ea3-6bfe4a28c79f.png)\r\n\r\nI also tried adding content to `tsconfig.json` (derived from [here](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)) and reloading VS Code\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n        \"module\": \"system\",\r\n        \"allowJs\": true\r\n    },\r\n    \"exclude\": [\r\n        \"node_modules\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut nothing changes. No more Syntax Checks, no more Auto Complete, no more Intellisense. Removing `tsconfig.json` and reloading VS Code brings it all back.\r\n\r\nSo I'm stuck. Please Help! Thank you!\r\n\r\n**Note 1**: I can't reproduce this issue when I open a new and empty project, then add a `ts` and a `js` file and then add a `tsconfig.json` file. In this new project everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n**Note 2**: This project has a pretty large codebase and unfortunately I cannot share it for others to investigate.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.8.1\r\n- OS Version: Linux Mint 17.1 Rebecca\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Unfortunately unknown\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18724","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18724/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18724/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18724/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18724","id":201552128,"number":18724,"title":"Activity design for panel switcher","user":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":296838217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/ux","name":"ux","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"stevencl","id":1704059,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1704059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl","html_url":"https://github.com/stevencl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"stevencl","id":1704059,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1704059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl","html_url":"https://github.com/stevencl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-01-18T11:49:03Z","updated_at":"2017-04-11T19:44:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Now that we have the panel switcher added, we should think about how to show activity.

requested](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12922#issuecomment-273415314) by @isidorn, I'm filing this issue separately.\r\n\r\nThe issue of case-insensitivity on Windows is basically breaking everything with my experience in C/C++ development, especially when using MSVC toolchain. I have duplicate files opened most of the time (that are not with same path according to `vscode`, therefore they function as two distinct files):\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/421916/22060213/31962096-dd70-11e6-81a7-cc0825862618.png)\r\n\r\nThe problem often (like every 5 minutes) results in this:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/421916/22060215/3884c7d6-dd70-11e6-9b7f-a86d905fc602.png)\r\n\r\nWhich in turn results in a lot of changes being lost, or serious time waste in trying to merge the two files.\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, this is a major issue in the `vscode` core for anyone trying to use Windows-only command-line tools. And so it is a problem for extension creators on Windows, as they are required to be extra careful with case-sensitivity required currently by `vscode`, which does not follow platform guidelines for handling paths.\r\n\r\nAlso it is very easy to get to this state (using MSVC `cppvsdbg`), which is the biggest problem:\r\n1. Open a file from *Explorer*.\r\n2. One of the following:\r\n  a. Put breakpoint to a C/C++ file. Run debug and get a new file instance each time you step (so even if you close it, the next step will reopen the same file).\r\n  c. Open an issue from *Problems* view and get a new file instance.\r\n  d. Open a file from external application with different case in the path (cmd, Total Commander, etc.) and get a new file instance.\r\n\r\nIn fact you can have dozens of instances of the same file.\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/421916/22060284/7215020e-dd70-11e6-8c80-10e093ba1cd5.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18717","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18717/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18717/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18717/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18717","id":201532343,"number":18717,"title":"Warnings

Ideally it would also be able to be open at the same time as the explorer panel.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if one could have the list sorted both \"naturally\" as it comes in the code but also be able to sort it alphabetically and apply filters on it (see only public/protected/private or vars or methods etc) to customize the result. \r\n\r\nBe able to choose if it should include members of parent classes in the scope or not would also be very nice. \r\n\r\nFurther it would also be helpful to be able to rearrange the \"natural order\" by drag and drop to reorganize the file. #\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18699","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18699/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18699/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18699/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18699","id":201468468,"number":18699,"title":"Integrated terminal closes as soon as I attempt to open it.","user":{"login":"aviraldg","id":238916,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/238916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviraldg","html_url":"https://github.com/aviraldg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviraldg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviraldg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviraldg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviraldg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviraldg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviraldg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviraldg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviraldg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviraldg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-01-18T03:13:27Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T18:57:26Z","closed_at":"2017-04-21T18:57:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.8.1 (ee428b0eead68bf0fb99ab5fdc4439be227b6281, 2016-12-19T14:41:20.664Z)\r\n- OS Version: Linux x64 4.8.0-34-generic\r\n- Extensions:\r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|vscode-wakatime|WakaTime|1.0.6|\r\n|vscode-eslint|dbaeumer|1.2.2|\r\n|python|donjayamanne|0.5.5|\r\n|Go|lukehoban|0.6.52|\r\n|cpptools|ms-vscode|0.9.3|\r\n|wordcount|ms-vscode|0.1.0|\r\n|Spell|seanmcbreen|0.9.1|\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
