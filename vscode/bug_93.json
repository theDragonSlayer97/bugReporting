VSCode Version: 1.16.0-insider commit 1c6f2f9a8012565adcc50616c3aa90cb444e8797\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Insider build 16257\r\n\r\nIf you use PowerShell as your default shell for the integrated terminal and specify a runtimeExecutable with spaces in it's path, two things might happen:\r\n1. If you don't specify runtimeArgs, the console will just echo the path for the executable\r\n2. If you specify runtimeArgs, the command will fail with `Unexpected Token in expression or statement`\r\n\r\nThis happens because if there's a space in the path, the path is put into quotes. However in PowerShell, if you enclose the path in quotes, it gets evaluated as a string and not as an executable, For the file to be executed, the path string has to be prepended with a `&` symbol, so for example `'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Yarn\\bin\\yarn.cmd' start` becomes `& 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Yarn\\bin\\yarn.cmd' start`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a launch config\r\n2. Set `request: \"launch\"` and `runtimeExecutable: <executable with a space in it's path>`\r\n3.
