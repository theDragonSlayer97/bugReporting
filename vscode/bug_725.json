of the directions modern web components are moving is declarative `html`. A bit like`jsx` but the other way around :) Now for `html / js` @rictic made a extension https://github.com/Polymer/vscode-plugin that brings auto completion for web components and their attribute defenition look up to a next level. https://youtu.be/zxcfPACo4-g?t=1h3m42s So that part is already done and backed by Google. Notice that we are talking web components in general here not just polymer.\r\n\r\nThe problem is there is no `html` inline `ts` solution yet. We can't really expect from the polymer team to integrate `<script type=\"ts/module\">` by themself in that extension.\r\n\r\nNow because `ts` is baked in vscode, inline `html / ts` compile support should be baked in as well. My first step is to convince everybody that if vscode can handle inline `html / ts` it would clear the way for using typescript web components by default. Right now typescript is not being used in polymer components because having two separate files, one for `ts`, one for `html` takes away the main strong point of declarative component programing. `Jsx` proved already that `html` and `js` logic can be used together as a great way to structure your code. At Google they do the same but in a more `html` declarative way. \r\n\r\nEDIT1:\r\n* vscode need to be doing intellisense on `<script type=\"ts/module\">` content in html files\r\n* vscode option to transpile `example.ts.html` to `example.html` with the `script` contents and `script type` replaced.\r\n\r\nfilename: `example.ts.html`\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"import\" href=\"../polymer/polymer-element.html\">\r\n<dom-module id=\"hello-world\">\r\n  <template>\r\n    <style>\r\n      :host {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        box-sizing: border-box;\r\n        border: 1px solid red;\r\n        margin-top: 10px;\r\n        padding: 0px 5px;\r\n      }\r\n    </style>\r\n    <p>Test <slot></slot></p>\r\n  </template>\r\n  <script type=\"ts/module\">\r\n    class HelloWorld extends Polymer.Element {\r\n      _hello: string = 'Hello World'\r\n      static get is() {\r\n        let test: string = 'test intelli'\r\n        test.toUpperCase()\r\n        return 'hello-world';\r\n      }\r\n      static get config() {\r\n        return {};\r\n      }\r\n      constructor() {\r\n        super();\r\n      }\r\n      connectedCallback() {\r\n        super.connectedCallback();\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    customElements.define(HelloWorld.is, HelloWorld);  \r\n  </script>\r\n</dom-module>\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT2: Note I am also looking into how close ES20XX syntax and typescript syntax are going to get that a future browser can just ignore all the typing syntax and read `<script type=\"ts/module\">` just like ES20XX javascript :) The browser doesn't need to look at the typings at all, just be smart enough to ignore typings that's it. If the two syntaxes matches close enough that can't be much to ask for browser vendors and the ECMA262 community right?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/717\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14032/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14031","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14031/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14031/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14031/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14031","id":184104455,"number":14031,"title":"Missing Sublime command - Increase / Decrease font size","user":{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":425577013,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-core","name":"editor-core","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-10-20T00:05:12Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T20:54:42Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"While building this [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings) I found that VS Code is missing feature parity with Sublime Text.

VSCode Version: 1.6.1\n- OS Version: 10.11.6\n- Node Version: 5.2 through 6.8.1 (at least)\n\nSteps to (maybe) Reproduce:\n1. add some breakpoints to your app\n2. launch\n\nNormally, the breakpoints are triggered and execution stops. A yellow line appears on the screen where the code is stopped. Playback controls appear. Sometimes this will NOT work correctly--execution stops, playback controls appear but WITHOUT the yellow line. You can click Play/StepOver/StepInto which may or may not cause VSCode to stop correctly at the next breakpoint in the series.\n\nThe worst part is that it's unreproducible. The same breakpoints will work for hours and then stop working suddenly.\n\nSteps to mitigate the problem:\n1. Less likely to happen if you have MORE breakpoints, especially on any lines that return promises. \n2. Sometimes you can persuade VSCode to find the next breakpoint if you click StepInto two or three times and then press play\n\nI wish I could add more details to this issue. It's affected me for months but I was hesitant to create an issue because of my lack of data. If this is a known problem please let me know and I'll contribute in any way I can to the discussion.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14022","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14022/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14022/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14022/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/14022","id":184079449,"number":14022,"title":"Enable

VSCode Version: 1.6.1\n- OS Version: macOS\n\nThe editor component of VSCode does not highlight/outline the currently selected line when in read-only mode. The ability to highlight lines in read only mode is useful for a variety of reasons. For example in [sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/Microsoft/vscode@master/-/blob/src/vs/platform/editor/common/editor.ts#L49) we use this to bring attention to specific lines when the UI navigates the user to a new cursor position after a jump-to-definition.  \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nYou can reproduce this within the Monaco playground\n1. Open the [Monaco playground](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/playground.html) and instantiate a new read only editor. E.g.\n\n```\nmonaco.editor.create(document.getElementById(\"container\"), {\n    value: \"function hello() {\\n\\talert('Hello world!');\\n}\",\n    language: \"javascript\",\n    readOnly: true\n});\n```\n1.
