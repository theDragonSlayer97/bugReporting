is a discussion going on in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commit/08a1700e7fbd5104516688821d7ff83eb8a52bc7 where @chrmarti saw an issue on startup for new users that never started Code before. I never saw this issue but the fix seems odd to me: we now suddenly create the directory (`userData`) via `mkdirp` that is owned by Electron/Chrome, which seems wrong. It should be created by the framework, not us.\r\n\r\nCan we move the `getNodeCachedDataDir()` into the `app.once('ready')` callback? That is the place where all code should go that assumes a certain directory structure to be present, not before.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19661","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19661/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19661/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19661/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/19661","id":204501714,"number":19661,"title":"Use
