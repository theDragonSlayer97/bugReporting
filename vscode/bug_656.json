debugger skips the breakpoint if you set them after blank new line at the beginning of the file.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.7.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create new index.ts\r\n2. Copy the following typescript code\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Intentional blank line goes after this line\r\n\r\nhello()\r\nhello()\r\nhello()\r\n\r\nfunction hello() {\r\n  return 'hello'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure you write the first `hello()` on the third line (the second line is empty)\r\n\r\n3. Compile it with `tsc --sourceMap index.ts`\r\n4. Configure debugger launch settings with\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"node\",\r\n  \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n  \"name\": \"Launch Program\",\r\n  \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}\\\\index.ts\",\r\n  \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\r\n  \"outFiles\": [],\r\n  \"sourceMaps\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Set breakpoints on `hello()` function call (all of them)\r\n6. Run the debugger session\r\n\r\nYou will see that the breakpoint will stop at the second `hello()` function call, not the first one. I've already test the breakpoint with the compiled js file and it correctly stops at the first call. I don't know if this is the internal Node.js source mapping problem or the VSCode debugger integration problem.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9102276/20646462/828b9064-b4ab-11e6-911b-00ecad01661f.png)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16107/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16106","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16106/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16106/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16106/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16106","id":191846596,"number":16106,"title":"Feature

\r\nI have idea, i dont know if anyone is willing to develop the extension in vscode or code itself provide such feature yet.\r\n\r\nI am using **araxis merge** in my work, the way i work i open two files side by side and it shows the difference, not only difference it allows to insert the difference text from file A to B and VICE Versa in just a simple click.\r\n\r\nAnother feature is when i add two folders side by side, it **opens the tree of both folders and subfolders side by side**, with the file name alongwith differences count. When i open that file it generates the difference i mentioned above.\r\n\r\nIt would be really helpful if any one create such extension in vscode, and team could remove the blocking points by adding such features like folder tree view in one tab and other tabl - side by side may be.\r\n\r\nI wish i could develop this extension but due to unavailability of time and managing my code sync extension i wont be able to develop this. :) \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nShan\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16088/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16087","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16087/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16087/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16087/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16087","id":191794618,"number":16087,"title":" The category of the markdown command `markdown.category` should not be translated","user":{"login":"satokaz","id":13635244,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13635244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satokaz","html_url":"https://github.com/satokaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satokaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satokaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satokaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satokaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satokaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satokaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satokaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satokaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satokaz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":299344519,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/markdown","name":"markdown","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"kieferrm","id":4674940,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4674940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm","html_url":"https://github.com/kieferrm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kieferrm","id":4674940,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4674940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm","html_url":"https://github.com/kieferrm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-11-26T08:38:40Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T08:36:59Z","closed_at":"2016-11-28T20:48:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.8.0-insider (1.8.0-insider) 0b847998d914ff84fd9c13b2972cc8803745c24d\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.12.1（16B2657)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\"Markdown\" has been translated into Japanese.\r\n\r\n1.
