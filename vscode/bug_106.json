Perhaps, instead, VS Code can simply do git integration at the first level where it encounters a valid .git folder. That is a much more scalable solution, but there may be caveats I'm unaware of.

is probably a bit of a rant, but I am having widespread systemic issues trying to use Code for real - as in for professional development.\r\n\r\nBasic usability features simply don't work - or work until they stop working, at which point an F1 -> Reload Window is required.\r\n\r\nFor example, TypeScript intellisense.  It works, then stops working.  Reload required.  This probably the root cause for why the F12 key stops working. \r\n\r\nOccasionally, the build command simply stops working.  Ctrl-shift-B stops doing anything.  Great.\r\n\r\nEven though I have one task defined in tasks.json and it's set to be the default build command, when I press it, I still get a dropdown asking me to choose tsc as being the build command.  Why?!\r\n\r\nA simple TSC->Webpack (both in watch mode) configuration appears to be basically impossible with the tasks.json unless I start using commands, gulp, or some other wizardry that I don't have the time to learn.  It really feels like whoever designed tasks.json's schema has never used an IDE before.  Why can't I just run two commands one after the other when I press ctrl-shift-B (and why isn't the default F5?)\r\n\r\nAnd then of course there's the no multi-monitor support.  I know it's on the backlog, but it's a pretty big issue.\r\n\r\nFinally - what's the deal with the 15+ Code.exe processes that are all using 100+mb of ram?  I feel like this increases every time \"Reload window\" is used, which is often.  Maybe my extensions are to blame.  Of course without some of them (e.g., TFVC) I can't really do my job so that's not a consolation.\r\n\r\nI'm still using it because VS2017's quality has spiraled so far downward that it's even less usable than Code is right now with all its bugs for front-end dev with modern frameworks.\r\n\r\nThis editor has potential but these issues are holding it back, big time.  Please spend some more effort on the basics before cramming in more useless features like a CSS color palette picker.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32639","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32639/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32639/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32639/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32639","id":250635396,"number":32639,"title":"Error in the php color scheme","user":{"login":"MioVisman","id":5917956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5917956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MioVisman","html_url":"https://github.com/MioVisman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MioVisman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MioVisman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MioVisman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MioVisman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MioVisman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MioVisman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MioVisman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MioVisman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MioVisman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":293382067,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/php","name":"php","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":286886536,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-16T13:54:14Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T19:30:53Z","closed_at":"2017-09-13T19:30:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.15.0 (8b95971d8cccd3afd86b35d4a0e098c189294ff2, 2017-08-09T20:16:06.988Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 6.1.7601\r\n- Extensions: none\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
