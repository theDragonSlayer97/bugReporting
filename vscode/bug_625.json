Here is a couple of examples (usually I use VS code for typescript projects):\r\n\r\n1. When I run vs code and there are no opened files, CTRL+T doesn't provide any result. For new users of VS code it's a bit unobvious fact, that you should open some file before perform some navigation.\r\n2. If I have several tsconfig.json files in my workspace (atleast two), it performs search only within nearest one relative to an editing file. So, I can't see any classes and interfaces from the first project if I'm editing a file from the second project.\r\n\r\nI suppose that this a bit strange behaviour origins from Typescript Language Service (tsserver), but can these issues be resolved on VS Code side?
