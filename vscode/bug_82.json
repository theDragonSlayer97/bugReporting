VSCode Version: 1.15.1 (commit 41abd21afdf7424c89319ee7cb0445cc6f376959)\r\n- OS Version: `Linux version 4.10.0-32-generic (buildd@lcy01-01) (gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.4) ) #36~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Wed Aug 9 09:19:02 UTC 2017`\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open new file.\r\n2. Type normal text (with spaces, eg `chick en`) until word wrap is reached, **the last character on the line should be a letter [a-z], and it should be AT the word-wrap length**. That is, if the cursor is right past the last letter, the column number should be equal to `editor.wordWrapColumn`.\r\n3. Now add a comma `,`; the comma is not wrapped, despite the fact that it is past the last column. This is great, and not necessarily unexpected to treat punctuation specially.\r\n4. Remove the comma, and instead type `),`: now the comma is wrapped but not the parenthesis. This is unexpected; I would either expect both not to be wrapped, or else the entire word with punctuation to be wrapped.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think that punctuation should either:\r\n\r\n - not be wrapped for up to 2 chars beyond `editor.wordWrapColumn` (eg to allow things like `last word).` or `last word),`); \r\n - or that the entire word with punctuation should be wrapped together instead of just the punctuation (eg `word).` should be wrapped instead of just `.` presently).\r\n\r\nIt also seems that commas `,` have a special treatment with regards to word wrapping. So the simplest might be either to remove this special treatment, or include parentheses and brackets to it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33365","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33365/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33365/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33365/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33365","id":253595614,"number":33365,"title":"Exception

@sqs\r\n\r\n> Would you be interested in a PR that implemented a UI like this? I just hacked this together tonight.\r\n> \r\n> The Open Repositories section works like the Open Editors section; it grows (to a point) based on the number of open repositories. Selecting a repository shows that repository's (and only that repository's) SourceControlView in the rest of the viewlet. Focus is in the Open Repositories list initially.\r\n> \r\n> It would be fairly easy to make it possible to show multiple repositories' SourceControlViews if you multi-selected them. That would of course be duplicating some functionality of a viewlet's subviews (e.g., you could make it so right-clicking on the Source Control header would let you check/uncheck each repo, as in the extensions viewlet), but it seems quite convenient to make this always visible.\r\n> \r\n>
