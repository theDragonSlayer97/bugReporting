VSCode Version: 1.2.1\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Build 14372\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Define a parameter of type array in the appropriate parameters section of the template.\n2. In a section that requires an array, pass only the parameter instead of starting and ending with square brackets.\n\nThis specifically relates to an issue I see when using the dnsServers setting to define the DNS servers to use when creating a NIC.\n\nIn the following piece of code, the dnsServers value doesn't validate, despite it being passed as an array - I appreciate this may not even be possible to fix given the types declared may simply not be validated at this level.\n\n```\n\"parameters\": {\n    \"onPremDNSServers\": { \n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n},\n\"resources\": {\n\n    {\n      \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\",\n      \"type\": \"Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces\",\n      \"name\": \"[concat(parameters('BEvirtualMachineNames')[copyIndex()],'-nic')]\",\n      \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\n      \"copy\": {\n        \"name\": \"BEnicLoop\",\n        \"count\": \"[length(parameters('BEvirtualMachineNames'))]\"\n      },\n      \"dependsOn\": [\n      ],\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"ipConfigurations\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"ipconfig1\",\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"privateIPAllocationMethod\": \"Static\",\n              \"privateIPAddress\": \"[concat(parameters('BEsubnetIPPrefix'),copyIndex(parameters('BEnicStartingAddress')))]\",\n              \"subnet\": {\n                \"id\": \"[variables('BEsubnetRef')]\"\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        ],\n        \"dnsSettings\": {\n          \"dnsServers\": \"[parameters('onPremDNSServers')]\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDespite the green squiggles, the ARM template will deploy successfully, it seems that just because there are no square brackets immediately after `\"dnsServers\":` - the green squiggles appear with `Incorrect type. Expected \"array\"`\n\nThe full ARM template (which works when deployed) is attached. Line 153 gives the green squiggles.\n\n[azuredeploy.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/348739/azuredeploy.zip)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8775","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8775/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8775/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8775/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8775","id":163952276,"number":8775,"title":"Auto-detected

files will not work correctly. `Reload typescript project`, `Reload window` or navigating to `tsconfig.json` and back may remove red squiggly lines. But when one file works, another usually do not. This means I almost always have red errors in vscode for imported files or even `lib.es6.d.ts` objects/methods.\n\nThe only easy place where I can reproduce it is in my repo (see .gif above).\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Clone https://github.com/csvn/ng-esm.git and run `npm install`\n2. Open folder with vscode\n3. Navigate between different `.ts` files under `src` folder\n4. vscode should complain about: unknown namespaces, Symbol, Reflect etc\n5. Reload window/typescript\n6. The current file should be fine, but navigating to other `.ts` files produce similar errors\n\nI have the same issue on two computers with both insider and regular vscode. I believe this to be an issue with vscode due to typescript building without issues, and due to the randomness of the errors.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8763","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8763/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8763/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8763/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8763","id":163882750,"number":8763,"title":"Git Fetch / Rebase","user":{"login":"SK83RJOSH","id":1371787,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1371787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH","html_url":"https://github.com/SK83RJOSH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-05T15:46:18Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T10:50:08Z","closed_at":"2016-07-06T10:50:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: N/A\n- OS Version: N/A\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

We have therefore decided that in July we will slow down feature work in favor of reducing our bug backlog and removing debt. Given this, we have the following themes for July:\n- Bug/Issue management: review, cleanse, fix \n- Reduce debt items\n- Engage and support popular extensions. We want to make sure that popular extensions are as good as possible so we will spend time supporting these extensions with feedback and Pull Requests.  \n- React to feedback from the June release\n\nThe [July Test Plan items](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Atestplan-item+milestone%3A%22July+2016%22) are created as issues get closed.\n### Schedule\n- July 25 Code freeze for the endgame \n- July 29 endgame done\n\nWe end an iteration with an [endgame](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Development-Process#end-game).
