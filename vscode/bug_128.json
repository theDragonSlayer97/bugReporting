CTRL+F to show find widget, set Regex mode\r\n1. Type a simple regular expression that matches some text in your document.  Make some minor changes by typing part of the expression, deleting with backspace, maybe move around the text field with the arrow keys.\r\n1. CTRL+Z / CTRL+Y several times to undo/redo typing the expression.  Redo until the expression is complete, and ensure that some text in your document matches and gets highlighted.\r\n1. Once your expression matches something on the page, press CTRL+H.  The \"Find\" field should change from the expression you just typed to the literal value that was matched.  (This is unexpected behavior, IMHO, but isn't the worst part.)  Your focus should now be in the \"Replace\" box.\r\n1. Tab or click back to the \"Find\" field.\r\n1. CTRL+Z several times, then CTRL+Y several times, to move back and forth through your undo history.  You should see several characters erased, then replaced *with totally different characters* as matched literal text is \"un-done\" and regular expression control characters are \"re-done\".\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior:\r\n\r\nIdeally, CTRL+F / CTRL+H would only populate the \"Find\" box with the document selection when it's currently empty.

VSCode Version: 1.14.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows\r\n\r\nSince v1.14, VS Code shows linting errors about image URLs for

shown when the URL is relative even if that is not SVG, in `README.md` and `package.json`.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n`package.json`\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\"icon\": \"icon.png\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n`README.md`

that the linting message should not be shown.\r\nOr, should we fix the URLs?
