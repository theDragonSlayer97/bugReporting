interact with insiders separately the following things can be done.\r\n1. Extension writers should always upload the newer version for insiders compared to normal build release in that tab.\r\n2. Extension page should show the extension version for insiders in the left side below to owner information.\r\n3. Extension writers will have an option to release that insiders build to normal build in just one click as insiders build will always be newer than normal so writes than use that method to update.\r\n4.

this extension insiders build should be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Aim**\r\nExtension writers can upload two version at once, one for insider and one for normal and transfer the insider build version to
