can create documents in our system that eventually cause text models to be created (via [`$tryOpenDocument`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/api/node/mainThreadDocuments.ts#L156)).\r\n\r\nWe correctly use `createModelReference` so that model lifecycle is ref-counted, however we fail to dispose this reference at any time (as outlined by this comment:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// TODO@Joao TODO@Joh when should this model reference be disposed?\r\n// ref.dispose();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis blocks me from adopting references for untitled/files ([TextFileEditorModelManager disposes models it doesn't own](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17888)) because unless I can rely on people disposing these references properly, we would end up with major leaks of models throughout the system (this is the reason why today I have weird code that disposes file models if I think they are no longer being used).\r\n\r\nSetting to March so that we can finish this story that we started.\r\n\r\nAlso slightly related: we need a way to signal that a resource is literally gone. So, no matter how many references have been created, a way to force disposal of the underlying model (e.g. when a file gets deleted). I guess we will need this for extensions too (e.g. git).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21708","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21708/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21708/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21708/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21708","id":211307884,"number":21708,"title":"Minimap
