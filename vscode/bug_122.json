Alternatively, one can select consecutive items by clicking the first item and then SHIFT+clicking the last item. But multi-selection is not supported in the VS code explorer view. When working on a large project sometimes it is needed to select multiple files/folders and operate them together, such as opening, deleting, or submitting to VCS, etc.\r\n\r\nWithout this functionality it could be tedious to operate files.

Do you have a question?

Open a text file using spaces for tabs (doesn't matter how many indented lines there are)\r\n2. Have a code completion response returning tabs for indentation, like:\r\n```[Trace - 3:45:32 PM] Received response 'completionItem/resolve - (316)' in 18ms.\r\nResult: {\r\n    \"label\": \"something() : void\",\r\n    \"kind\": 3,\r\n    \"detail\": \"Override method in 'IFoo'\",\r\n    \"documentation\": \" This should be inherited \",\r\n    \"sortText\": \"999998843\",\r\n    \"filterText\": \"something\",\r\n    \"insertText\": \"something\",\r\n    \"insertTextFormat\": 2,\r\n    \"textEdit\": {\r\n        \"range\": {\r\n            \"start\": {\r\n                \"line\": 9,\r\n                \"character\": 4\r\n            },\r\n            \"end\": {\r\n                \"line\": 9,\r\n                \"character\": 5\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        \"newText\": \"@Override\\npublic void something() {\\n\\t${0}\\n}\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nOnce the text edit applied, the indentation is transformed to use spaces\r\n\r\n2. Do the same thing from a code action, like \r\n```\r\n[Trace - 3:59:58 PM] Received response 'textDocument/codeAction - (436)' in 9ms.\r\nResult: [\r\n    {\r\n        \"title\": \"Add unimplemented

Click terminal area in Code through another app\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior for click-through on macOS is that focus goes to the area that you've clicked. For instance, if I have a (standard) Terminal window with two tabs open and the Finder is the foreground program, clicking on a tab on that terminal window will both bring the Terminal app in focus and switch to the tab that I've clicked.\r\n\r\nWith Code, the actual behavior is that the program goes to the foreground but the focus within the app stays with whatever was focused at the time Code was put to the background.\r\n\r\nThis frequently causes me to start typing commands in my editor view.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32151","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32151/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32151/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32151/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32151","id":248785182,"number":32151,"title":"Request for new feature","user":{"login":"leox3107","id":18049513,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/18049513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leox3107","html_url":"https://github.com/leox3107","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leox3107/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leox3107/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leox3107/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leox3107/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leox3107/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leox3107/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leox3107/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leox3107/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leox3107/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-08T17:13:04Z","updated_at":"2017-08-08T17:34:39Z","closed_at":"2017-08-08T17:34:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\nRequest for drag and drop images into markdown docs.\r\n\r\n<!-- Do you have a question?
