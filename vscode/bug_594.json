pull request adds selected lines count in case of non-collapsed selection.\r\n\r\n![This is how it does looks like](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5353898/21575506/1d462566-cf0e-11e6-9c72-e3fb93614a5b.png)\r\n\r\nIt fixes #932 and #15344 (which is a dup of former one).\r\n\r\n## Remarks\r\n\r\n### Multiple selections\r\n\r\nI did not add lines selected information in case of multiple selection on purpose. Reason for this is that you might have a selection like that (bracket marks range):\r\n\r\n```\r\na[aaaa\r\nb]b[b]b[b\r\nc]cccc\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case we effectively have 3 lines selected, however with the simplified implementation that just adds TextModel.getLineCountInRange() for each range, it would give us 5 lines (2 + 1 + 2).\r\n\r\nSo instead of showing possibly buggy value, I decided not to show it at all.\r\n\r\nIf you'll like the feature, I can implement more clever way to count unique lines for multiple selection, just let me know.\r\n\r\n### nlsSingleSelectionRange default string adjusted\r\n\r\nYou will note that I've also added \"characters\" part in case of single selection range.\r\n\r\n```const nlsSingleSelectionRange = nls.localize('singleSelectionRange', \"Ln {0}, Col {1} ({3} lines, {2} characters selected)\");```\r\n\r\n### `monaco.d.ts`\r\n\r\nWhile adding method ITextModel it looks like it got automatically added to `monaco.d.ts`, because I don't recall adding it there. Just worth to mention, as I'm not super familiar with Code internals.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17955/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17954","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17954/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17954/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17954/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17954","id":198212114,"number":17954,"title":"VS
