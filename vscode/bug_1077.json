Our launch options for C# and C++ support some object level properties in launch.json. Specifically, arrays of strings and arrays of name value pairs.  This was working back in December so. Now, the json parser for launch.json generates a new object that then the parser calls replace on. Since this isn’t a string, that throws an exception and fails the launch.\nExample from our launch schema:\n\n“customLaunchSetupCommands”: [{“text”:”target-run”, “description”: “run target”, “ignoreFailures”: false}]\n\nCallstack:\n\nValue.replace is not a

red/orange bar on the code line that you edited. After than line of code is in orange/red bar you can only remove it by closing the file and reopening it.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nvar example = function () {\n<<<<<<< Updated upstream           (this is a red/orange line)\n    var updated;\n=======                            (this is a red/orange line)\n    var stashed;\n>>>>>>> Stashed changes            (this is a red/orange line)\n}\n```\n\nThen remove the git stashed/updated lines:\n\n```\nvar example = function () {\n    var stashed;\n}\n```\n\nThen undo the changes:\n\n```\nvar example = function () {\n<<<<<<< Updated upstream           (this is a red/orange line)\n    var updated;\n=======                            (this is a red/orange line)\n    var stashed;\n>>>>>>> Stashed changes            (this is a red/orange line)\n}\n```\n\nThen redo the changes, there will be a red/orange line: \n\n```\nvar example = function () {        (this is a red/orange line)\n    var stashed;\n}\n```\n\nThen the only way you can remove that red/orange line is to close the file you're editing and reopen it.\n\nGif

this extremely annoying distinction between editor, working files and other views (e.g. settings). With a single, common shortcut key, if I have a thing open, I want to be able to close it and it's gone. If it was in working files, it's gone from there too. It doesn't matter what I had open, I want it gone. Screwing around trying to learn the different ways to close things and having to maintain a mental note of whether I'm closing an editor or a working file is irritating to the point that it's keeping me away from VS Code. The fact is, if I close a working file, getting it back with CTRL+P is so easy and frictionless that I don't even care that I closed it. If I could just have a shortcut key to \"just close whatever the hell is currently open and, if applicable, remove it from working files too\", that would be fantastic.\n\nFor what it's worth, I don't really care about the whole debate around tabs-or-not. Working files is fine for me in this regard. Saving the previous workspace state of a working file, even if it gets closed, is a pretty good idea though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4923","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507415105","x-github-request-id":"DED3:3670:AC70D4:1BD3EDA:59D9478C","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1078>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1076>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"5d248c53879ca9222cb10be6acd6371a\"","status":"200 OK"}}
