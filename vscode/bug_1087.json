To test do the following:\n#### Package.json for Extensions\n- create a package.nls.json file as a sibling to your package.json file\n- in `package.json`, replace strings that should be localized with a key surrounded by %%. For example\n\n``` json\n\"commands\": [\n            {\n                \"command\": \"typescript.reloadProjects\",\n                \"title\": \"%typescript.reloadProjects.title%\",\n                \"category\": \"TypeScript\"\n            }\n        ],\n```\n- In the package.nls.json add a key value pair that maps the key to a human readable value for our default language (which is English).\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"typescript.reloadProjects.title\": \"Reload Project\",\n}\n```\n\nEnsure that when you start  the extension the correct string is presented in the user interface. Also ensure that pseudo translation works. To do so start vscode with --locale=pseudo. The strings from the package.nls.json should be enclosed in [] and vowels should be doubled.\n#### CommonJS Extensions\n\nInstall `vscode-nls` as a dependency of your extension. In the extension main add the following code:\n\n``` typescript\nimport * as nls from 'vscode-nls';\nlet localize = nls.config({ locale: 'pseudo' })();\n```\n\nAnd in the activate function add\n\n``` typescript\nconsole.log(localize('key', 'Extension activated'));\n```\n\nThis should show the following in the console:\n\n```\n[Plugin Host] ［Exteensiioon aactiivaateed］\n```\n\nIn other files in the extension you don't need to configure the nls module again. You can simple do:\n\n``` typescript\nimport * as nls from 'vscode-nls';\nlet localize = nls.loadMessageBundle();\n```\n\nIf you want to leave the code in since you tested it with your extension code then simply remove the locale property and initialize as follows:\n\n``` typescript\nimport * as nls from 'vscode-nls';\nlet localize = nls.config()();\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3155","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3155/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3155/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3155/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3155","id":134806013,"number":3155,"title":"when

@daviwil on February 18, 2016 18:53_\n\nWe're seeing an issue in the PowerShell extension where our trigger for static .NET class methods is not resulting in the right IntelliSense in VS Code.  To reproduce the issue, try typing this in a PowerShell script file after installing the PowerShell extension on a Windows machine:\n\n``` powershell\n[DateTime]::\n```\n\nAfter the second `:` we would expect an IntelliSense pane to appear.  Our language server sends the `:` character back as a triggerCharacter in our completionProvider section of the serverCapabilities object in the Initialize response.  Could there be an issue with the double-colon?\n\nAnother interesting problem here is that using `Ctrl+Space` after the double-colon results in an empty IntelliSense list even though our server gets the request correctly and returns a list of IntelliSense results.  Can you think of a reason why the results wouldn't be applied in this case?\n\nWe're tracking the issue on our side here: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/163\n\nLet me know if it's more appropriate to file this on the Microsoft/vscode repo.\n\nThanks!\n\ncc @rkeithhill @dfinke\n\n_Copied from original issue:

am using `Mocha` to run tests due to it's popularity yet I cannot get the debugger to attach when launching a task to run tests.\n\nWhat I have started to do is run tests using Grunt with the `debug-brk` option set to true so that it stops on the first statement and waits for a debugger to connect on port 5858. I can then attach the VS Code debugger and start using breakpoints.\n\nI just discovered that when I attach the debugger in this way I need to make sure that `sourceMaps` is set to true. By default this option is not even defined with the \"Attach\" task. This is an important detail. I hope including it here helps others who are working with TypeScript. It would be helpful to add it to the tasks template even with the value set to off like it is for launching tasks.\n\nI am creating this issue in hopes of learning how I can get VS Code to automatically attach to the running Mocha task with it working with source maps so I can debug through TypeScript without the extra step.\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n
