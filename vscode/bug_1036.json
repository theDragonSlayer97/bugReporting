Observe that there is no table of predicates that may be used for `when' attributes - there is not even a note about the use of logical operators.\n\nInside VS Code, when the default keyboard shortcut definitions are open, you can discover a few of the predicates by reading existing definitions.

For example, for the string\n\n```\nfoo bar  baz   fum\n```\n- inside \"foo\" it returns character offsets [0, 3)\n- inside \"foo\" it returns [4, 7)\n- inside \"foo\" it returns [9, 12)\n- inside \"foo\" it returns [15, 18)\n\nBut:\n- for the space before \"fum\" it returns undefined\n- for the space before \"baz\" it returns undefined\n- for the space before \"bar\" it returns [0, 3)\n\nEven if someone says, \"the word's range end should point to an offset just past the end of the word\", then I would say, \"great, that's called a half-open interval, but the space after 'foo' and 'bar'

closed

is a `TextDocument.getText()` method but there isn't a `TextDocument.setText()` method. The reason I (think) need this is for my [final-newline](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/vscode-final-newline) extension. It adds a final newline when the page is saved. But if the user presses `Save All` from the menus, it doesn't work because it only performs the action on the current active text editor document.\n\nI listen to the `onDidSaveTextDocument`, which calls a listener with the `TextDocument` as parameter. From there on I can get the text, save the document, etc. but I cannot manipulate the document.
