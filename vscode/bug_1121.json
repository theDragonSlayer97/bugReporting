I was just learning it I just started a second semester in programming. Then I read about Visual Studio Code which seemed pretty cool as it says to be a somewhat lightweight and easy IDE and yes it absolutely sure is! I just cannot get the debugging mode to work for the life of me, can't figure out how to run the program, just 3 basic outputs. I changed a location setting somewhere in a wizard to the folder on my computer that I thought I was supposed to do and now I get this error:\n\nrequest 'launch': program 'c:\\Users\\Daniel\\OneDrive\\Documents\\School\\COP2800 - JAVA\\Assignment 1\\app.js' does not exist\n\nNow I can't figure out where this app.js file even is by doing file explorer searches, and I have uninstalled, restarted, then reinstalled back into the computer and all my previous settings remained. I had no option to remove and do a clean install or something. So I don't know what to do because I'd like to use code as opposed to eclipse or notepad or jgrasp but I have messed it up somehow.

step:\n1) Add .d.ts file that contains a type definition for a class that doesn't contain a member referenced in the code file. In the attached image, I change the first line to <code> var imageRange = context.document.getSelection() as Word.Range;</code>. <code> Word.Range</code> showed as IntelliSense (auto-completion)\n2) Then the type checker gives the warning you see in the image, 'Property X does not exist on type Y.' This behavior is correct as that property is not listed in the .d.ts file. (it is in the js library).\n3) Then, if I remove the <code>as Word.Range</code> conversion from the first line, I'd expect that the warning would go away since I'd expect that the type check would go away. The actual behavior is that it looks like it is using a type check cache -- I removed the type conversion for the variable but it still states that the property doesn't exist on the object. I'd expect that message to go away as the code doesn't provide the object type. \n\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8527305/12442639/6e3cf968-bf06-11e5-8f6a-02cc4213c9f2.PNG)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4879","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507415105","x-github-request-id":"E4AC:366F:CE681B:1937796:59D94865","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1122>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1120>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d64d094865df35ac7026be84a3e3cb8a\"","status":"200 OK"}}
