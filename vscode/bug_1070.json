the moment the virtual documents created by TextDocumentContentProvider can contain links to external resources, but I would expect it to work with links that use the same scheme that was registered with registerTextDocumentContentProvider.

vscode.Uri.parse('link-test://authority/page1');\n\n    const provider = {\n        provideTextDocumentContent: function(uri) {\n            if (uri.path === \"/page1\") {\n                return `<a

correct.\n\nI've done a workaround to deal with different keyboard layouts [here](https://github.com/aioutecism/amVim-for-VSCode/pull/45).\nBut users have to add a setting in configuration in order to tell the extension the layout they are using.\nThis is troublesome and extension shouldn't do all the handling of keyboard

earlier conversation with Andre\n\nWe’ve run into a limitation with the threading support in vscode for the C++ and C# debugging efforts that the diagnostics team is working on. Specifically, the current callstack window will only walk a thread if a stopped event for that thread has been sent. This makes sense as it appears the design is currently optimized for the stop one thread model (where only the thread that hit a bp or experienced another stopping event actually stops). \n\nHowever, both of these engines (C++ and C#) operate in the stop all mode where a single stopping event implies that all threads (or runtime in the case of C#) are stopped. \n\nWhile we could work around this by sending a stopped event for all threads in the process, the end result is vscode will ask us to walk the callstack for all threads in the process at each stopping event. Callstack walking has been one of the major sources of performance issues in the visual studio debugger on these runtimes, and in that case, we typically only walk the stack of a single thread, so we feel this will wind up being an issue with the vscode integrated debuggers as well. \n\nWhat we would like to propose would be to allow a debug adapter to enable  stop all mode so that stopped events for the other threads is implied and limiting the callstack request coming from the ui to only the threads that actually have their callstacks open in the thread’s window or whose frames are requested by debugger service in the ui.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3649","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3649/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3649/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3649/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/3649","id":137976302,"number":3649,"title":"Use local version of gulp in build steps","user":{"login":"phillipj","id":1231635,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1231635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillipj","html_url":"https://github.com/phillipj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillipj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillipj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillipj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillipj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillipj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillipj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillipj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillipj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillipj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-03-02T19:59:16Z","updated_at":"2016-03-03T09:05:35Z","closed_at":"2016-03-03T09:05:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/pulls/3649","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/3649","diff_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/3649.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/3649.patch"},"body":"Previously developers had to install gulp globally on their machine to build the project.
