VSCode Version: 0.10.11\n- OS Version: Windows 7\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n- Open a new buffer (Ctrl+N)\n- Set the language mode to JavaScript (Ctrl-K M)\n- Type some code with wrong indentation, e.g.\n\n```\nvar x = 1;\n    var y = 2;\n```\n- Try to format the code (Alt+Shift+F)\n\n**What happens**: Nothing.\n**What is expected to happen**: Code should be formatted.\n\nI tried to fix this bug, but realized that it might be a design issue:\n- Code formatting is carried out by an external plugin (in case of JS it's the TS-Server)\n- VSC issues a corresponding \"format\" message [formattingProvider.ts:102](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/4da8ef4e95e423071596a64b3d37c638b6700a62/extensions/typescript/src/features/formattingProvider.ts#L102) to the TS-Server consisting params of the format `{\"file\":null,\"line\":1,\"offset\":1,\"endLine\":25,\"endOffset\":3}`.\n- The TS-Server tries to open file `null` from its `syntaxTreeCache` which leads to this error:\n  \n  \"{\"seq\":0,\"type\":\"response\",\"command\":\"format\",\"request_seq\":76,\"success\":false,\n  \"message\":\"Error processing request. Cannot read property 'replace' of null\"}\"\n\nwhich is caught at [formattingProvider.ts:105](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/4da8ef4e95e423071596a64b3d37c638b6700a62/extensions/typescript/src/features/formattingProvider.ts#L105) but not logged anywhere, apparently.\n\nSo the issue is, an unsaved buffer has no file path and, hence, is not accessible for the TS-Server. potentially, this might be fixed by using some internal fake path, which would be known to the TS-Server's `cacheSyntaxTree`. Apparently, a physical file is not a hard requirement. Initially I assumed, that VSC only sends a file name to the TS-Server, who reads the file, computes the range and sends the formatted code back. However, a fast test disproved this:\n- save a buffer to a file\n- delete file immediately from the FS \n- change the code and try to format it\n- ensure it worked\n\nSo: the TS-Server uses the filename but reads the file content from some internal cache shared between VSC and TSS. This cache might be the right place to reference the unsaved buffer. But if I'm right, it's a subject for a major design change.\n\nIf you have better suggestions because I overlooked something feel free to inform me and I could make another

The key is to make it non-obtrusive and immediately relevant and thoughtful to the user's present needs.  There should be a global setting to disable it, if users don't want it.
