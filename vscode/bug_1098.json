may be specific to Python but is certainly relevant for languages where spacing is important)\n\nIf I have some code like this:\n\n```\n    if displayName == \"\":\n        displayName = groupName\n    description = getAttr(attributes, \"description\")\n    mailAddress = getAttr(attributes, \"mail\")\n```\n\nand I press CTRL+K, CTRL+C, the lines get properly commented out with \"# \" prefixing each line, meaning that the indentation remains correct for Python's requirements:\n\n```\n    # if displayName == \"\":\n    #     displayName = groupName\n    # description = getAttr(attributes, \"description\")\n    # mailAddress = getAttr(attributes, \"mail\")\n```\n\nHowever, if there is a blank line in the selection, e.g.:\n\n```\n    if displayName == \"\":\n        displayName = groupName\n    description = getAttr(attributes, \"description\")\n    mailAddress = getAttr(attributes, \"mail\")\n\n    print \"||Group name|%s|\" % displayName\n    print \"||Description|%s|\" % description\n    print \"||Email address|[mailto:%s]|\" % mailAddress`\n```\n\nthe commenting goes wrong because VS Code sees the blank line and then assumes that all of the lines need the comment at the start of the line rather than at the start of the code. In other words, I get this:\n\n```\n#         if displayName == \"\":\n#             displayName = groupName\n#         description = getAttr(attributes, \"description\")\n#         mailAddress = getAttr(attributes, \"mail\")\n# \n#         print \"||Group name|%s|\" % displayName\n#         print \"||Description|%s|\" % description\n#         print \"||Email address|[mailto:%s]|\" % mailAddress\n```\n\ninstead of this:\n\n```\n    # if displayName == \"\":\n    #     displayName = groupName\n    # description = getAttr(attributes, \"description\")\n    # mailAddress = getAttr(attributes, \"mail\")\n    #\n    # print \"||Group name|%s|\" % displayName\n    # print \"||Description|%s|\" % description\n    # print \"||Email address|[mailto:%s]|\" % mailAddress\n```\n\nThis can break the Python code because subsequent lines need to be at the same indent level.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2836","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2836/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2836/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2836/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2836","id":132398970,"number":2836,"title":"I

would make sense to be able to extend functionality and behavior of the debugger also in the frontend. In my specific case, I wish to **hover a global variable** and have it (through https://github.com/WebFreak001/code-debug) send a simple `p Module_Variable` to my target hardware over remote GDB.\n\nSimilar to how Watch does it:\n\n![gdb_remote_debug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1297882/12913777/06060fee-cf21-11e5-99f8-b30754412020.gif)\n\nFollowing from https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2745:\n\n> When remote debugging (GDB in my case) and not being able to breakpoint, it would be super helpful to be able to read variables on the fly (e.g. with hover). The workflow of adding variables to Watch takes forever in comparison and doesn't continuously update.\n> \n> For reference, this works in Eclipse where hover polls variables between breakpoints.\n\n.\n\n> Agreed, this would of course only make sense on global variables. My colleague has written a GDB bridge for our embedded development and then uses a GDB plugin to poll global variables using hover (I'll double check which plugin).\n> \n> As I'm an embedded developer working mainly with C, a simple p Module_Variable is what I'm looking to send. Then it's up to the debugger (in this case GDB) to lookup the memory address and return me the results.\n> \n> This might only be valid for a structural language such as C.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2832","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2832/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2832/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2832/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2832","id":132382915,"number":2832,"title":"Function breakpoints","user":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/12","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/12","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/12/labels","id":1512192,"number":12,"title":"Feb 2016","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":337,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-01-18T10:26:06Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T09:03:53Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2016-03-09T15:09:51Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-02-09T10:30:14Z","updated_at":"2016-02-24T11:55:35Z","closed_at":"2016-02-24T11:55:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- [x] win @alexandrudima \n- [x] linux @aeschli\n- [x] mac @joaomoreno\n\nWe now support **function breakpoints** on global functions for node debugging.

the PluginHost crashes, VS Code reports that it has to be restarted. However, one of the prime causes of the crash generally involves an extension that misbehaved. But the problem is that once VSCode produces that error, it ends up in one of two states:\n1. VS Code's command palette is responsive. But `ext` commands no longer work (simply keeps showing the sliding icon).\n2. The command palette itself doesn't work anymore. \n\nSo, now a restart of VS Code ends up crashing right away due to the same misbehaved plugin. And the loop cannot be broken since the only way to actually remove the crashing plugin now doesn't work. (provided the user is actually savvy enough to identify the crashing plugin without any help from VS Code in non-simple cases). This is quite a serious bug IMO. \n\nI had to go about removing the data files for it to start working (which again is tricky since vscode seems to maintain the installed extensions internally so just removing the extension's folder doesn't always help). \n\nNote: The plugin that crashed my vs code to an unrecoverable state was `asciidocs` extension, at the time of filing this issue. \n\nAside: After the plugin crash, text editor seems to be working, with the exception of a few control keys like `Backspace`. Hmm.

with `Position` objects is not ideal when trying to incrementally sync documents. Additionally it is impossible to compare them with each other without an unnecessary performance hit. If you want to delay and merge events to keep the number of edits down in large documents, this becomes a basic requirement.\n\nConsider the following `TextDocumentContentChangeEvent` objects:\n\n``` javascript\nlet first = {\n  text: '\\r\\n',\n  rangeLength: 0,\n  range: {\n    start: { line: 1, character: 0 }\n    end: { line: 1, character: 0 }\n  }\n}\nlet second = {\n  text: 'a',\n  rangeLength: 0,\n  range: {\n    start: { line: 2, character: 0 }\n    end: { line: 2, character: 0 }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this text document:\n\n```\nb\ncd\n```\n\nIndividually, they are both accurate, but since the start/end ranges have changed, the language server cannot determine the precise location of the second event without either applying the first event or parsing it to count the number of line breaks and the new character offset. Things only get worse if the changes overlap, since you would need to keep track of every newline.\n\nAll of this can be avoided if instead of the relative range location, an absolute location such as the offset into the document is provided.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2810","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2810/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2810/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2810/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2810","id":132305472,"number":2810,"title":"Cannot

was just reading the [latest updates](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) and it says one can install `typescript@next` globally and then set `typescript.tsdk` so VS Code can use the appropriate version/installation. In a team environment, I'd like to put that setting in our project, something like:\n\n`.vscode/settings.json`:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"typescript.tsdk\": \"%APPDATA%/npm/node_modules/typescript/lib\"\n}\n```\n\nThe problem is restarting VS Code results in an error:\n\n```\nThe path c:\\Projects\\Derp\\%APPDATA%\\npm\\node_modules\\typescript\\lib doesn't point to a valid tsserver install. TypeScript language features will be disabled.\n```\n\nNow the setting needs to be per-person because I highly doubt my teammates have `tsc` installed in `C:\\Users\\Olson\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\typescript\\lib` :wink:\n\nCould we get environment variables evaluated on that and all other settings that involve paths?\n\nI haven't tested other paths, but I see these in the Default Settings:\n- `git.path`\n- `markdown.styles`\n- `json.schemas`\n- `typescript.tsdk`\n- `php.validate.executablePath`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2809/reactions","total_count":40,"+1":40,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4902","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507415105","x-github-request-id":"E1DE:366F:CE24F9:192EEDB:59D947F0","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1099>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1097>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d77043d8542c60c785dfc540f7d56b0c\"","status":"200 OK"}}
