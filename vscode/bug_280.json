But, `settings.json` is a file meant to be tracked by the VCS. I am currently being forced to `.gitignore` this file to not be bothered by new entries appearing regularly.\r\n\r\nExample of file: `iostream`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOf course, I asked about this situation on vscode-cpptools first (Microsoft/vscode-cpptools#722) where I got the following answer:\r\n\r\n\"Our tool automatically adds a c/cpp to file.associations whenever the a C/C++ file with an extensionless or non-standard file extension is navigated to via a source file -- this enables the header file to be treated as C/C++ for colorization and other features (otherwise, it opens as a text file). The only mechanism VS Code provides for enabling this scenario is updating the files.associations setting, which is stored in the settings.json, and there's no mechanism for storing other settings elsewhere. If you have a proposed alternative design, it would probably have to be implemented in VS Code itself (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues ). One potential solution is for the openTextDocument called internally by VS on a Go To Definition to automatically supply the languageID of the source file. We could also add a setting to turn off this behavior or you could modify the /out/src/C_Cpp.js yourself to replace code con.update(\"associations\", assoc); with ; (and/or add a script to do the replacement for when the file is overwritten by an update).\" @sean-mcmanus Microsoft/vscode-cpptools#722\r\n\r\nThank you @sean-mcmanus\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt feels like a solution to this problem could involve a vscode enhancement / feature.

Open a window with the previewHTML content.\r\n3. Start an incremental search and type letters which move the selection around and see your previewHTML getting updated.\r\n4.

If you hover over `f.bar`, it will say it's \"any\". They should both say \"string\".\r\n\r\nObject.assign is a fairly common way of setting several properties with a bit less copy/paste. In cases where an object without known type information is used as the last argument it isn't possible to statically infer appropriate types for the modified object (\"this\", here) and equivalently the object that Object.assign returns. Where type information of the last argument _is_ known, it is safe and appropriate to import all of that into the type information for the object, as if a series of direct assignments had been done.\r\n\r\nCaveats: In Javascript (perhaps not Typescript) it's possible that further unknown properties are present on any given object, so it would be appropriate to void all inferred type information which is not between Object.assign and the end of the constructor. If Object.assign is used outside a constructor (on a named object) it should void all inferred types entirely, because the type information could be entirely different before and after. The same should be true if Object.assign is conditionally called in the constructor. The only exception should be when all arguments after the first have known final type information, eg. an immediate object.\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes, `Object.assign(foo, bar, {baz: 1})` should be considered equivalent to `for(name in bar) if(bar.hasOwnProperty(name)) foo[name] = bar[name]; foo.baz=1;`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27396","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27396/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27396/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27396/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27396","id":231859554,"number":27396,"title":"Can't
