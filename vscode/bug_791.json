Create a markdown file with the following contents:\n   \n   ```\n   asdf\n       qwer\n   \n   ***\n   asdf\n     qwer\n   ***\n   ```\n   \n   Replace the \\* with markdown backticks so that the second `asdf` and `qwer` are in a code block.\n   \n   To clarify, the `qwer` outside the code block is indented by a tab character, and the `qwer` inside the code block is indented by 2 spaces.\n3. Close and reopen the file to force VSCode to re-render it.\n4. The tab that indents the first `qwer` (the one outside the code block) is rendered as two columns wide instead of four columns as the setting specifies. Also, if I add new lines and indent them with <kbd>Tab</kbd> they'll be indented by two spaces, not even a tab.\n\nI hit this while writing a document that embeds code snippets from various locations, and some of those snippets use two spaces for indentation.

VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.6.0-insider (fad6a894c197ee791403ac694c9316b0654f31a4, 2016-09-14T13:18:39.616Z)\n- OS Version: Linux x64 4.4.0-36-generic, Ubuntu 16.04\n\nCurrent:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2193314/18524039/a403a33c-7a6b-11e6-94e6-02f60bc61668.png)\n\nProposed:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2193314/18524117/fe9a1f7e-7a6b-11e6-8c73-0d6aac733096.png)\n\nTo describe the behavior I want: It should replace all parts of the start of the path that are the same with `…/`, then add the differing word(s) and then either `/…/` or `/`. This makes it easier to differentiate each tab and also reduces the total space taken by the tab particularly in a deep directory structure.\n\nSome interesting cases could arise when more than 2 files collide in which maybe 2 parts of the path would need to be displayed, for example:\n- `src/vs/workbench/parts/execution/electron-browser/terminalService.ts`\n- `src/vs/workbench/parts/execution/electron-browser/something/terminalService.ts`\n- `src/vs/workbench/parts/terminal/electron-browser/terminalService.ts`\n\nCould yield:\n- `…/execution/electron-browser/terminalService.ts`\n- `…/execution/electron-browser/something/terminalService.ts`\n- `…/terminal/…/terminalService.ts`\n\nBasically just providing enough information to uniquely identify the file, `electron-browser` could not be truncated above as `…/execution/…/terminalService.ts` represents both files.\n\nAnother interesting edge case: single letter folders would probably consume more space when truncated.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12040/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12039","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12039/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12039/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12039/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/12039","id":176980259,"number":12039,"title":"HTML/Razor/Handlebars

However, the VS Code TypeScript editor does not properly surface this information. The `this` variable in the function gets typed as `any` within the function but the editor still enforces that use of `this` in the function conform to the type information used to describe `this` for the function. This results in the odd issue of the editor not providing any intellisense for the `this` due to it being typed as `any` but still expects it conform to the shape of `this` described by the `this` type annotation for the function.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/208549/18518597/7bc87732-7a55-11e6-8cc4-731fb5d86e11.png)\n### Reproduction\n\nThe following minimum TypeScript file will reproduce the issue in VS Code.\n\n> index.ts\n\n``` typescript\ntype ctxA = {\n    funB: (paramA: string) => void\n}\n\ninterface TestObj {\n\n    propA: {\n        funA: (this: ctxA) => void\n    }\n\n}\n\nlet objA: TestObj = {\n\n    propA: {\n        funA: function() {\n            // errors since funB dosen't match the signature (missing paramA) of funB in ctxA even though the editor types it as any\n            this.funB();\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n```\n### Expected Result\n\nThe VS Code TypeScript editor should properly surface the type information for `this` in functions and not just type it as `any` to provide proper intellisense.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12032/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12031","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12031/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12031/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12031/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/12031","id":176941576,"number":12031,"title":"Display
