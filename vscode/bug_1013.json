Turns out @outcoldman  is now struck by this. My only reasonable explaining is that `enableTasks` is sometimes [not true](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/electron-browser/index.html#L172)\n\nI see those options\n- We always register an instance of an `ITaskService`, the real-one or a dummy\n- We check if debug is prepared for not having a task service\n- We don't let the instantiation service explode anymore

Compile https://gist.github.com/edumunoz/6e2ca90d4b5d3dbfa5340576e79ac113 with `g++ -g -std=c++11 -pthread hello.cpp -o hello`\n2. Install the [C++ debug adapter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)\n3. Set a breakpoint in line 17 from the gist\n4. Have the main thread expanded in the callstack viewlet\n5. Expand another thread and click on a frame for which no source is available\n6. The \"Load More Stack Frames\" button appears for the main thread\n7. The \"Load More Stack Frames\" button is clicked, the callstack for the main thread gets duplicated (two `main()` in the screenshot)\n\nStep 3\n![loadmoreframes-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/637952/14575064/49c19a7e-0314-11e6-8863-6b457d261f6e.png)\n\nStep 5\n![loadmoreframes-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/637952/14575071/5a5a64f6-0314-11e6-8438-f0e9390a7d53.png)\n\nStep 6\n![loadmoreframes-3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/637952/14575076/64f29410-0314-11e6-8a2f-a06df05cb8e2.png)\n\nI understand if the debug adapter implements the \"Load More Frames\" feature, this will work.
