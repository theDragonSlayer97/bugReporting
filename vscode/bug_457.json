Open the View Menu\r\n2. Observe the following options:\r\n   * Move Side Bar [Right/Left]\r\n   * Toggle Side Bar\r\n   * ...\r\n   * Hide Activity Bar\r\n\r\nHere we have both \"Side Bar\" and \"Activity Bar\" referring to the Vertical Menu and drawer.  It seems \"Side Bar\" is supposed to refer to the expanded part and \"Activity Bar\"; however, this is not very discoverable and the Activity Bar can reasonably expected to be the referenced Side Bar.  The \"Activity Bar\" is *a sidebar* and it moves when I choose \"Move Side Bar\" and the drawer I perceive as attached to it expands/collapses (shows/hides) when I choose \"Toggle Side Bar.\"  However, when I want to hide it I need an option related to the \"Activity Bar\" rather than the \"Side Bar.\" (In my case I had to come to GitHub and search issues to find that the behavior I was looking for was that option).\r\n\r\nedit: [there is evidence I am not the only person to encounter this confusion](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15310#issuecomment-259962222)\r\n___\r\n\r\n## Suggestions\r\n\r\nAssuming the current names are to be kept, I recommend the following changes:\r\n\r\n* Standardize on Toggle or [Show/Hide].\r\nSo either \"Toggle Activity Bar\" or \"[Show/Hide] Side Bar\".  This helps to put widgets on equal footing and the consistency helps to lessen the possible association that \"Toggling\" the side bar changes the state or the Activity Bar rather than showing/hiding an independent widget. (Note: This would apply to more than this entry)\r\n\r\n* Make \"Move Side Bar [Right/Left]\", \"Move Activity Bar [Left/Right]\"\r\nThis helps to establish the name \"Activity Bar\" and explains why the option moves the Activity Bar when the option is selected and not just the Side Bar.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22087","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22087/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22087/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22087/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22087","id":212185388,"number":22087,"title":"delayed

Call `getExtension` with all characters of extension name lowercased (like `ms-vscode.powershell`)\r\n4. Extension details are returned\r\n\r\nThis is a **breaking change** because it means I can't support both VS Code 1.10.1 and Insiders concurrently if I change my extension code to adjust to this.  VS Code 1.10.1 allows me to get extension details for `ms-vscode.PowerShell` with that exact casing and returns null if I give it `ms-vscode.powershell`.  \r\n\r\nI'm currently using this API to get the current version of my extension to send to my language server.\r\n\r\nAny idea what might have changed to cause this?
