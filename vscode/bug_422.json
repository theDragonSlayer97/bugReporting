is a question about how to interpret changes passed to `onDidChangeTextDocument`.\r\n\r\nI was unable to find any documentation in the code or vscode-docs, so it would be great to have this documented somewhere other than Github issues.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic onDidChangeTextDocument(ev: vscode.TextDocumentChangeEvent): void {\r\n    ev.changes // how to interpret this\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf onDidChangeTextDocument is called with ev.changes\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"range\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"line\": 0,\r\n        \"character\": 1\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"line\":

format\r\n- Insert \"x\" at index 1\r\n- Insert \"y\" at index 2\r\n\r\nSuppose an initial document state of \"ab\".\r\n\r\nWhat should the state be for the final document?\r\n- `axby` // index is interpreted from original document change\r\n- `axyb` // index is interpreted from document with partial changes (i.e. when applying \"y\" change we assume that \"x\" has already been applied).\r\n\r\nAnother way to phrase my question: how should the indexes be interpreted?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23135","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23135/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23135/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23135/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23135","id":216634904,"number":23135,"title":"'Find

\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[] git add changes.log\r\n[] git commit -am \"some log\"\r\n[] git push ci master\r\n[] git push origin master\r\n[] git push pub master\r\n```\r\n\r\nand there can be status change

/>\r\n...\r\n```\r\nassume above file is encoded with `euc-kr` encoding. \r\n2. set `files.encoding` option as `utf8`\r\n3. open that file and it is opened as `utf8`. `euc-kr` character parts in file are not rendered correctly.\r\n\r\nmy suggestion is, when html file have `<meta charset=\"...\"/>`, how about vscode to attempt to open that file with specified charset?\r\nor auto detect by somehow?\r\nor.. `files.encoding` option might be an array and order is precedence. if attempt to `utf8` decoding fails or produce screwed character, try next one.\r\n```json\r\n\"files.encoding\" : [\"utf8\", \"euc-kr\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n[sample.html.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/866666/sample.html.zip)\r\n\r\nI attach sample `euc-kr` file as above.

VS Code 1.10.2\r\n- Windows 10 Anniversary\r\n\r\nIn the latest update of the PowerShell extension (0.11.0) we now use an integrated terminal instead of the Debug Console for interactive execution of

Would be nice if it was possible to pass to the code.exe command a parameter that specifies a path to a custom settings.json file that could be used for these different methods to override the default user settings.json file.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I utilize the PowerShell extension a lot. Most of the time I will want the PowerShell extension to load the PowerShell session it uses to handle IntelliSense, code navigation, integrated console, etc. For me this takes a considerable amount of time as my profile must connect to Active Directory, Exchange, Lync, etc. in order to load modules for the services I develop for. This is perfectly fine when I am about to work on some project where I need all of those remote PowerShell sessions loaded. However, ever since VSCode started getting much faster start up times I have also started using VSCode to quickly view PowerShell files using the context menu in Windows Explorer. I just right click a file and say \"Open in VSCode\". However, loading all these remote sessions just to quickly view a file is problematic for a number of reasons.\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell extension now provides a setting, `\"powershell.startAutomatically\": true`. Now I can set that setting to false to prevent the automatic loading of these session and I can also manually start it on demand with the `PowerShell: Restart Current Session` command. However, it would be nice if I could just have a separate settings.json file that has it disabled and then point the registry for the VSCode context menu to use this separate settings.json file via a command line switch. \r\n\r\nI realize this use case is fairly unique but I could imagine providing such a command line switch would be useful in a number of other circumstances.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23112","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23112/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23112/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23112/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23112","id":216539055,"number":23112,"title":"Regex or normal find support on DEBUG console and OUTPUT window","user":{"login":"nilanjan","id":512388,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/512388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilanjan","html_url":"https://github.com/nilanjan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilanjan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilanjan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilanjan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilanjan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilanjan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilanjan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilanjan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilanjan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nilanjan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-23T19:05:10Z","updated_at":"2017-03-27T09:29:20Z","closed_at":"2017-03-27T09:29:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Insider\r\n- OS Version: OS X Sierra\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do regex or normal search on debug console or output window?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4940","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"AFAB:366F:C638ED:182BC19:59D938D8","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=423>;
