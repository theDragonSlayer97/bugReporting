By creating a service, then try to send a post method i.e. :\r\n     http.post('/the_url', parameters, **options**)\r\n2.  I set wrong **options** parameter like this: \r\n    const headers = new Headers();\r\n    headers.append('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');\r\n    http.post('the_url', parameters, **headers**) instead of sending new RequestOptions({ headers: headers }) there.\r\n\r\nThe post method when uses just headers as option does not work and it does not complain about wrong type and this is really hard to detect because there is no errors or warning at compilation time or runtime. I guess the IDE must show a warning otherwise the goal of why it was created (script typed) stop making sense I guess. It is really helpful to have that kind of support at compilation time.\r\n\r\nWhen I replaced headers by RequestOptions({ headers: headers }) it worked properly. \r\n\r\nIt would be great if could consider it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nLuis.\r\n\r\n \r\n   ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20762","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20762/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20762/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20762/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20762","id":208215287,"number":20762,"title":"\"No Project\" reported by TSServer.js.
