VSCode Version: 1.9.0\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install [vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robertohuertasm.vscode-icons)\r\n2. Install [Vue language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liuji-jim.vue)\r\n3. Create a new file with the `.vue` extension.\r\n4. Instead of the `Vue icon` the `html icon` is shown.\r\n\r\n`vscode-icons` provides support for `Vue` files by leveraging the language id but it seems that the mechanism that it's used by the icon theme API is giving priority to the default language extensions provided by `VSCode`. \r\n\r\nThis has an unexpected behavior as **the users are not able to see the expected icon**. \r\n\r\nIn the case of `Vue`, you can see where it is associated to `html` in `VSCode`'s code in the [html extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/html/package.json#L37) as @JimiC pointed out in  [vscode-icons #725](https://github.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons/issues/725#issuecomment-277616047).\r\n\r\nThis is the only case where the file association has to be explicit, meaning that the [user has to explicitly change the file association](https://github.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons/issues/725#issuecomment-277642688) so she can see the proper icon. That's not the case when the language id is not provided by default by `VSCode`.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly creating inconsistencies in the user experience thus confusing the users about what they are supposed to do. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice if this could somehow be changed to prioritize custom language ids over default ones. This is at least what we were expecting from our side as icon theme builders until we've found out that this is not how it seems to be working.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20074/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20073","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20073/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20073/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20073/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/20073","id":205683512,"number":20073,"title":"Fix

Ideally was looking for any way to suppress the TS error blinking very 3 seconds constantly.\r\n\r\nSimilar to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9215  but only occurs with a SharePoint mapped drive letter.  Local folders OK.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n---UDPATE---\r\n\r\nI performed a fresh new install and the issue no longer occurs.   This may have been caused by either (1) install VSCode over Chocolatey or (2) a NPM Global installed different typescript version.\r\n\r\n1) Uninstalled VSCode from Control Panel\r\n2) Deleted \"npm\" and \"npm_cache\" folders at \"c:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Roaming\\\"\r\n3) Ran \"cuninst visualstudiocode\" to remove from Chocoately package manager\r\n4) reboot\r\n5) Install VSCode direct from website\r\n6) Test and works OK now editing JS files from mapped SharePoint drive letter\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20060","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20060/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20060/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20060/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20060","id":205641637,"number":20060,"title":"Ability to disable extensions by default","user":{"login":"AmirSavand","id":4629328,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4629328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirSavand","html_url":"https://github.com/AmirSavand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirSavand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirSavand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirSavand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirSavand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirSavand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirSavand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirSavand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirSavand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmirSavand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":343063018,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/extensions","name":"extensions","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-02-06T16:43:35Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T19:41:12Z","closed_at":"2017-02-08T19:41:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When adding a new project folder, it takes a bit of time to disable extensions for workspace,\r\nit would be good if there was a way to disable an extension by default.\r\n\r\nAlso, when installing a new extension, it gets enabled for all other projects too which takes time to disable for every project that doesn't need that ext.
