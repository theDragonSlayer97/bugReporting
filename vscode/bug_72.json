To avoid polluting the workspace setting section we should be more careful of converting the settings and do the following:\r\n\r\n- either let extension flag that they did the adoption by a special flag in the package.json file. If so we convert their settings. If not we leave the settings untouched.\r\n- only convert a setting if it is explicitly marked as window in the package.json. We could still keep the default.\r\n\r\nIMO we should address this for September \r\n\r\n//cc @egamma we discussed this 'I did the adoption' flag

So, If I want to comment multiple consecutive lines, I have to first select all those lines/add cursors and then comment them. This behaviour is different than most IDEs and text editors and a teensy bit annoying. \r\n\r\nAs holding down \"Comment Line\" shortcut(Ctrl + \"/\")  currently does nothing. My suggestion is to add a system so if the shortcut is held for more than 2-3 seconds(Configurable) the cursor will jump to next line and comment it and keep doing that until you've released the shortcut keys. \r\n\r\nThis behaviour is similar to other IDEs and editors making it easier for people coming from other IDEs/editors to adapt vscode and also makes better use of shortcut. \r\n\r\nIf this sounds like a reasonable request, I would absolutely love to work on it.
