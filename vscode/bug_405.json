Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\nI often use the builtin terminal pane in VSCode. When using bash (bin/bash) with default macOS configuration from .bash_profile it will not be loaded by code. VSCode expects a .bashrc in the home directory. It would be nice if we can configure the bash conf path. At the moment I work around this by having a bashconf file and symlinking this to .bash_profile and .bashrc.

shouldn't be any requirement to provide URI for resources and resource groups. Everything should just work. Especially commands that are contextual to resources and resource groups.\r\n\r\nNotable changes:\r\n\r\n- `SCMProvider` renamed to `SourceControl`\r\n- `SCMResourceGroup` renamed to `SourceControlResourceGroup`\r\n- `SCMResource` renamed to `SourceControlResourceState`\r\n- `sourceUri` renamed to `resourceUri`\r\n- Instead of `scm.registerSCMProvider`, api users should use `scm.createSourceControl`. From then on, `sourceControl.createResourceGroup`. And then `resourceGroup.resourceStates = [state1,state2,state3].\r\n- Commands located in menus which are contextual to a resource(s) will receive that resource(s) as arguments automagically, instead of `Uri` instances.\r\n- Where you'd have to optionally specify a `contextKey` before, you now must specify an

pr is for using Monaco-editor with vscode-textmate. I use the `setTokensProvider` api for this, but while now the `setTokensProvider` can only accept string tokens, and actually in monaco there is a api called `_toBinaryTokens` to transform the string tokens into Uint32Array, while this api can only accept scopes as a string not a string array which is given from `JsGrammar.tokenizeLine`. So I changed the api for `setTokensProvider` and make it accept a `tokenizeLine2` function to use the Uint32Array tokens directly without `_toBinaryTokens`. The way to do what I want is below:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// get themes from vscode extensions\r\nimport { Registry, StackElement } from 'vscode-textmate';\r\nconst registry = new Registry();\r\nregistry.setTheme({ name: 'Dark+ (default dark)', settings: (DarkTheme.tokenColors.concat(DarkThemePlus.tokenColors)) });\r\nconst JsGrammar = registry.loadGrammarFromPathSync('./JavaScript.tmLanguage.json'));\r\nconst jsConfig = require('./javascript-language-configuration.json');\r\nlanguages.register({\r\n  id: 'javascript',\r\n  extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'],\r\n});\r\nlanguages.setLanguageConfiguration('javascript', jsConfig);\r\nlanguages.setTokensProvider('javascript', {\r\n  getInitialState: () => {\r\n    return StackElement.NULL;\r\n  },\r\n  tokenize2: (line, state) => {\r\n    const rule = JsGrammar.tokenizeLine2(line, state);\r\n    const ruleStack = rule.ruleStack;\r\n    return {\r\n      tokens: rule.tokens,\r\n      endState: ruleStack,\r\n    };\r\n
