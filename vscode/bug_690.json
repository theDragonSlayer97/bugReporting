Once the scrolling is activated it is smooth, but once you let go of the fingers on the touch pad and then start again, it again has a delay before the scroll starts.\r\n\r\nIt should work just as smooth as it does in e.g. Chrome or Edge.

VSCode Version: 1.7.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 7\r\n- Meteor Version:  1.4.1.3\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI am trying to use sequentially the node debugger and the chrome debugger extension to debug a CoffeeScript leaderboard toy app using the dual, client and server sides, full-stack framework Meteor.\r\nI put breakpoints in the server-side only code and in the client-side only code.\r\n\r\n I use the following VSCode Extensions:\r\n- Meteor-Helper 0.1.1\r\n- Debugger for Chrome 2.2.0\r\n\r\nSince\r\n1) Meteor is a dual side framework with\r\n- client-side only code\r\n- server-side only code\r\n- isomorphic code running on both sides\r\n\r\nand\r\n2) According to Rob Lourens who is helping me with the chrome debugger extension issues, VSCode currently does **_not_** support **_launching simultaneously\r\n\r\n_** both the server-side code built-in node debugger and the client-side code chrome debugger extension\r\n\r\nI thus proceed as follow:\r\n- I have an **Attach Server configuration in my launch.json file**\r\n{\r\n            \"name\": \"Attach Server\",\r\n            \"type\": \"node\",\r\n            \"request\": \"attach\",\r\n            \"port\": 5858,\r\n            \"address\": \"localhost\",\r\n            \"restart\": false,\r\n            \"sourceMaps\": true,\r\n            \"outFiles\": [\"${workspaceRoot}/.meteor/local/build/programs/server/app/app.js\"],\r\n            \"localRoot\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\r\n            \"remoteRoot\": null\r\n        },\r\n- I have an **Attach Client configuration in my launch.json file**\r\n{\r\n            \"name\": \"Attach Client\",\r\n            \"type\": \"chrome\",\r\n            \"request\": \"attach\",\r\n            \"port\": 9222,\r\n            \"address\": \"localhost\",\r\n            \"sourceMaps\": true,\r\n            \"outFiles\": [\"${workspaceRoot}/.meteor/local/build/programs/web.browser/app/app.js\"],\r\n            \"diagnosticLogging\": true,\r\n            \"webRoot\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\r\n            \"url\": \"http://localhost:3000/\"\r\n        }\r\n\r\nI put breakpoints in the server-side only app startup function.\r\n\r\n1. Using Meteor-Helper, I execute the meteor debug command\r\n\r\n2. I  then attach the node debugger.\r\nVSCode ignores the breakpoints and goes on to execute the entire app until the point when the app is waiting for a user action.\r\n\r\n3. At that point the breakpoints have turned hollow and grey and a hovering message says:\r\n\r\n> breakpoints ignored because generated code not found (soure map problem?)\r\n\r\n4. The output window tells me that the app is running at: http://localhost:3000/\r\n\r\n5. When I click on this url, VSCode opens the fs.js file (node file system) and stops before the return statement of the fs.statSync function defintion with the call stack saying \"paused on exception and a blank page opens in my chrome browser saying \"waiting for localhost\"\r\n\r\n![vscodenodedebuggernotstoppingatbreakpoints future js exception](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8970048/20043529/262395aa-a48f-11e6-83bf-a20cddad83aa.jpeg)\r\n\r\n6. Then when I click on the play icon of the node debugger, VSCode opens the future.js file, stopped at the  throw error line of the Future.prototype assignement statement and generating a Mongo Error connection time out\r\n\r\n7. It is only when I pause the node debugger that the first page of my app finally appears in the browser\r\n![vscodenodedebuggerissueafterpause](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8970048/20043530/289a0a58-a48f-11e6-8dca-d0f37269b417.jpeg)\r\n\r\n**The Meteor packages I used are:**\r\nmeteor-base@1.0.4             # Packages every Meteor app needs to have\r\nmobile-experience@1.0.4       # Packages for a great mobile UX\r\nmongo@1.1.12                   # The database Meteor supports right now\r\nblaze-html-templates@1.0.4    # Compile .html files into Meteor Blaze views\r\nreactive-var@1.0.10            # Reactive variable for tracker\r\njquery@1.11.9                  # Helpful client-side library\r\ntracker@1.1.0                 # Meteor's client-side reactive programming library\r\n\r\nstandard-minifier-css@1.2.0   # CSS minifier run for production mode\r\nstandard-minifier-js@1.2.0    # JS minifier run for production mode\r\nes5-shim@4.6.14                # ECMAScript 5 compatibility for older browsers.\r\necmascript@0.5.8              # Enable ECMAScript2015+ syntax in app code\r\nshell-server@0.2.1            # Server-side component of the `meteor shell` command\r\n\r\nautopublish@1.0.7             # Publish all data to the clients (for prototyping)\r\ninsecure@1.0.7                # Allow all DB writes from clients (for prototyping)\r\n\r\ncoffeescript@1.11.1_1\r\nmquandalle:jade@0.4.9\r\nstylus@2.513.5\r\n\r\n**The CoffeeScript source code is:**\r\n(I chose Insert code, but it did not preserve the white spaces :( )\r\n`class Player\r\n  constructor: (@name, @score = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)) ->\r\n\r\nclass Leaderboard extends Mongo.Collection\r\n  insertNewPlayer: (playerName, score) ->\r\n    player = new Player(playerName, score)\r\n    @insert player\r\n\r\n  insertPlayers: (nameList, scoreList) ->\r\n    @insertNewPlayer(playerName) for playerName in nameList\r\n    @insert(_id:player._id, score) for score in scoreList\r\n    # self = @\r\n\r\n  rank: =>\r\n    [lead, followers...] = @find({}, {sort: {score: -1, name: 1}}).fetch()\r\n    rank = 1\r\n    @update {_id: lead._id}, {$set: {rank: rank}}\r\n    previousScore = lead.score\r\n    tiedCounter = 1\r\n    for player in followers\r\n      do (player) =>\r\n        if player.score is previousScore\r\n          tiedCounter = tiedCounter + 1\r\n        else\r\n          rank = rank + tiedCounter\r\n          tiedCounter = 1\r\n        @update _id: player._id, {$set: rank: rank}\r\n        previousScore = player.score\r\n    # self = @\r\n\r\naflLeaders = new Leaderboard(\"aflLeaders\") unless aflLeaders?\r\n\r\nif Meteor.isClient\r\n  Template.leaderboard.helpers\r\n    players: -> aflLeaders.find {}, {sort: {score: -1, name: 1}}\r\n\r\n  Template.player.events\r\n    'click tr>td>button': ->\r\n      @score = @score + 1\r\n      aflLeaders.update {_id: @_id}, @\r\n      aflLeaders.rank()\r\n      self = aflLeaders\r\n     \r\nif Meteor.isServer\r\n  Meteor.startup ->\r\n    if not (aflLeaders? and aflLeaders.findOne({})?)\r\n      aflLeaders.insertPlayers([\r\n        \"Heath Shaw\"\r\n        \"Alex Rance\"\r\n        \"Easton Wood\"\r\n        \"Shaun Burgoyne\"\r\n        \"Jeremy McGovern\"\r\n        \"Matthew Boyd\"\r\n        \"Robbie Gray\"\r\n        \"Josh P.

maps that the build process of such app generates.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for helping out of this

VSCode Version: 1.7.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nI'm using `WorkspaceConfiguration.update` to try and update existing `launch.json` files due to a change in data passed to our debug adapter.
