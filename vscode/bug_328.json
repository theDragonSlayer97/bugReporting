VSCode Version: 1.12.1\r\n- OS Version: Linux, Debian sid 64 bit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Start vscode via CLI or launcher.\r\n\r\nObserved behavior:\r\n\r\nAfter a recent update, vscode started rendering itself as though it thinks my environment's DPI is much higher than it actually is. A similar problem affects Chrome and Chromium. The workaround for those applications is to start them with the `--force-device-scale-factor` option. The same workaround with vscode, i.e.\r\n\r\n````\r\n$ code --force-device-scale-factor\r\n````\r\ngets everything but the menu bar back to where it should be. With the workaround, the menubar is shrunk.  The app is usable with this workaround, but it would be nice if the workaround wasn't needed.\r\n\r\nNo errors are reported in the app or on the console.\r\n\r\nFor completeness,\r\n```\r\n$ xdpyinfo | grep resolution\r\n  resolution:    96x96 dots per inch\r\n```\r\nI am attaching two screenshots of my 1600x900 screen, one using the workaround and the other not.  Both were taken with vscode maximized.\r\n\r\n![vscode-noworkaround](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2021060/25731839/7674875a-310f-11e7-8f0d-c413933a245b.png)\r\n![vscode-workaround](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2021060/25731848/83ef0220-310f-11e7-8412-09c2678d8cb0.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25967/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25966","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25966/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25966/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25966/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25966","id":226455501,"number":25966,"title":"[themes]

all widgets using 'select-box' cannot theme\r\nthe selected or hover item colors (foreground/background)\r\nThe the color is controlled by the platform. That overrides\r\nnormal CSS approaches/selectors. \r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25272315/25731445/6cae4c38-3114-11e7-9400-254c525693ea.png)\r\n\r\nAfter a bunch of research, I did figure out one solution\r\nand made a prototype in a small electron app.\r\n\r\nThere appear to be three options:\r\n\r\n1 - Some CSS guru knows of a better trick\r\n2 - Use an input box on top of the current list widget \r\n3 - Use something like I came up with: \r\n\r\n   one select box that is the normal drop-down with current selection\r\n   automatically includes the drop-down arrow\r\n   a second select box which can be made hidden/visible depending\r\n   on the first lightbox focus/selection\r\n\r\n   The second select box can be styled with option:checked and box shadow\r\n\r\n   \r\noption:checked {\r\n    color: #ffffff;\r\n    box-shadow: 0 0 10px 100px #905000 inset;\r\n}\r\n\r\n    This box-shadow is the only thing I found that overwrites the platform colors\r\n    It does NOT work on a select box with only one item showing (nominal case)\r\n    That is what I came up with the two boxes and a bit of code to display and hide\r\n    the second box with the options list\r\n\r\nI think option two is more complicated and inherits the unneeded list properties\r\nif there is no option one , I would go ahead and prototype within VSC and do a PR\r\n\r\nThoughts

The tooltip says \"Identifier xxx is undefined\". Pressing ALT while hovering an additional entry offers \"Click to view/show xxx definitions\". \r\n\r\nThe reason is that the appropriate ATTiny header file cannot be included directly, but needs to be \"bootstrapped\" (as suggested by AVR) by\r\n\r\n`#include <avr/io.h>\r\n`\r\n\r\nfrom where the proper header is included by e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#elif defined (__AVR_ATmega16U2__)\r\n#  include <avr/iom16u2.h>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously VSCode is unable to follow this deep link and it marks the definitions red. Including the proper platform file into the source doesn't work, because compilation fails with\r\n\r\n`#error \"Attempt to include more than one <avr/ioXXX.h> file.\"\r\n`\r\n\r\ndue to a previous macro definition in io.h\r\n\r\nHow can I recover from this?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25945","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25945/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25945/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25945/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25945","id":226433747,"number":25945,"title":"cursorMove to viewPortBottom should not scroll","user":{"login":"o-lim","id":10095424,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10095424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-lim","html_url":"https://github.com/o-lim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-lim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-lim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-lim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-lim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-lim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-lim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-lim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-lim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-lim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-05-04T23:12:26Z","updated_at":"2017-05-26T20:54:40Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
