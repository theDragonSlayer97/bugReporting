Ideally, all of the git implementation would be self-referencing using relative paths and depend on the smallest number of shared modules as needed using absolute paths to the node_modules folders / modules.\n\n2) cross-dependencies into the vs directory - it looks like vscode was written in a semi-monolithic, but nicely grouped way rather than as many smaller modules. Ideally, there would be a separation between client, common, and node logic around smaller aspects rather than through the big `platform` and `workbench` buckets to reduce cross-dependencies and to promote reuse. When I'm trying to only compile an entry point through common/git/git.ts, it seems to be pulling in `vs/base/browser/keyboardEvent.ts` but I cannot figure out where the dependency is from (I'm new to typescript so not sure how to do dependency tracing).\n\nThese two aspects of code structure makes it difficult to separate the git functionality from all of the application logic so I'm putting aside this idea for now; however....I was wondering if there any plans to break up vscode into smaller, reusable modules using npm like Atom did?\n\nObviously, it is still early days for open sourcing vscode and I'm sure there are a lot of other things on your roadmap, but this would be a great longer-term goal!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/510","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/510/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/510/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/510/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/510","id":118444671,"number":510,"title":"Context
