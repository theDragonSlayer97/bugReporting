VSCode Version: 1.2\n- OS Version: Windows 10 x64\n\nTHE PROBLEM: At least under cp936 and using TrueType fonts, when rendering some characters, like `λ`, Windows will measure the real character width of the console font chosen, and allocate console cells to display them. (The full alglrithm of how character widths are calculated is listed in [consolelib.cs#L676](https://github.com/lzybkr/PSReadLine/blob/0ffd1b2351214f1f25a433060a6c75a29c59c90f/PSReadLine/ConsoleLib.cs#L676).) (ps. I am curious about why this algorithm is not ported to non-DBCS code pages, like 65001, given that the Console can actually render these characters, the result is not layouted well.)\n\nTherefore if the font used for the hidden console is inconsistent with the font configured in VSCode, the character widths may be incorrect. For the `λ`, most Windows users under cp936/932 will see this character rendered and layouted in full-width in the real console (because this lambda in NSimSun and MS Gothic is full-width), but Code will treat them as half-width, causing incorrect layout.\n\nTHE SOLUTION: Give option to set the font of the hidden console used by winpty in sync with the font used in Code.\n\nA sample font package: [Inziu](http://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/inziu.html). (Inziu Iosevka SC for 936, Inziu Iosevka J for 932.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7354","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7354/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7354/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7354/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7354","id":159017133,"number":7354,"title":"Integrated terminal content is clipped on the left.","user":{"login":"abhyankarsunil","id":4654937,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4654937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhyankarsunil","html_url":"https://github.com/abhyankarsunil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhyankarsunil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhyankarsunil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhyankarsunil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhyankarsunil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhyankarsunil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhyankarsunil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhyankarsunil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhyankarsunil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhyankarsunil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-07T20:30:01Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T22:24:16Z","closed_at":"2016-06-07T22:24:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:1.2.0\n- OS Version:Window 10 1511 Version: 10586.318\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
