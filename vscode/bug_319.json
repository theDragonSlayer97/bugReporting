Nevertheless I seek an option which neither pollutes existing windows which belong to a project nor opens new windows all the time._\r\n\r\n* ~~Open in last active window (I guess this is the current behavior)~~\r\n* ~~Always open in new window~~\r\n* Open in a dedicated window for shell-opened files (open such a window if it doesn't exist yet)\r\n\r\nMaybe even some setting per-window where we can set a specific window as target for all the next file-opening operations from the shell, if we want to...\r\n\r\nIt could already be mitigating most of the pain if VSCode would just never consider windows which have a project opened in them as targets for shell-opened files, but instead use other non-project windows or create one.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Based on the fact that half of this already exists, as I now know, I would love to have a mode which reads \"Files will open in the window with the files' folder open or ~~the last active window~~ a dedicated window for externally opened files. If such a window doesn't yet exist, it will be created.\" I understand that it may be not so straight-forward to do this because I ask for a special property of such a window which would need to be marked and I see that the transition to a normal window would be very short because users should of course be able to open other files in this window as well, so I'm not 100% sure yet what could be a good way to solve this - maybe a combination with my idea of a per-window exclusive flag, i.e. \"Files will open in the window with the files' folder open or _the window marked as target for externally open files_. If no such window exists, it will be created.\" and a way to move this flag.\r\n\r\nMaybe I think too complicated, though, but the bottom line of my request is that files should never be opened in a window which has a folder open which the file is not in. And I think that in any event \"Last active\" is not such a good choice because with several windows open one usually doesn't even remember which window happened to be last in focus when opening a file at another place...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26215","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26215/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26215/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26215/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26215","id":227067253,"number":26215,"title":"ctrl
