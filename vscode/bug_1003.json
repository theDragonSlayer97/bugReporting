I want to add an ability to access type information to `tslint` (see https://github.com/palantir/tslint/issues/1154) and the most efficient way to achieve this is to access existing tsserver instance if it's available. I think that this access can be helpful for some other plugins too.\n\nI know that vscode starts it's own tsserver instance in electron's fork, so maybe it's possible to access it somehow to make requests.\n\nI can't find anything about this in the docs. Please point me to the corresponding page if it exists.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5689","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5689/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5689/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5689/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5689","id":150527868,"number":5689,"title":"showInputBox

I close it and I find my console like this:\n\n```\nC:\\>git config --global -e\n\n[12844:33788:0422/183248:VERBOSE1:crash_service_main.cc(68)] Session start. cmdline is [--reporter-url=https://ticinocrashreporter.azurewebsites.net/crash --application-name=VSCode --v=1]\n[12844:33788:0422/183248:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(142)] window handle is 0250105A\n[12844:33788:0422/183248:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(290)] pipe name is \\\\.\\pipe\\VSCode Crash Service\ndumps at C:\\Users\\alshaker\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\VSCode Crashes\n[12844:33788:0422/183248:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(294)] checkpoint is C:\\Users\\alshaker\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\VSCode Crashes\\crash_checkpoint.txt\nserver is https://ticinocrashreporter.azurewebsites.net/crash\nmaximum 128 reports/day\nreporter is electron-crash-service\n[12844:33788:0422/183248:VERBOSE1:crash_service_main.cc(84)] Ready to process crash requests\n[12844:51472:0422/183248:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(323)] client start. pid = 41860\n[12844:51472:0422/183248:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(323)] client start. pid = 51724\n[50628:50588:0422/183248:VERBOSE1:crash_service_main.cc(68)] Session start. cmdline is [--reporter-url=https://ticinocrashreporter.azurewebsites.net/crash --application-name=VSCode --v=1]\n[50628:50588:0422/183248:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(142)] window handle is 0289045E\n[50628:50588:0422/183248:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(290)] pipe name is \\\\.\\pipe\\VSCode Crash Service\ndumps at C:\\Users\\alshaker\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\VSCode Crashes\n[50628:50588:0422/183248:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(294)] checkpoint is C:\\Users\\alshaker\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\VSCode Crashes\\crash_checkpoint.txt\nserver is https://ticinocrashreporter.azurewebsites.net/crash\nmaximum 128 reports/day\nreporter is electron-crash-service\n[50628:50588:0422/183248:ERROR:crash_service.cc(301)] could not start dumper\n[12844:23300:0422/183253:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(331)] client end. pid = 41860\n[12844:23300:0422/183253:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(331)] client end. pid = 51724\n\nC:\\>[12844:23300:0422/183254:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(352)] zero clients. exiting\n[12844:33788:0422/183254:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(490)] session ending..\n[12844:33788:0422/183254:VERBOSE1:crash_service.cc(495)] clients connected :2\nclients terminated :2\ndumps serviced :0\ndumps reported :0\n[12844:33788:0422/183254:VERBOSE1:crash_service_main.cc(89)] Session end. return code is 0\n```\n\nYou can see it bleeds to the second prompt too.\nIs this expected? Is there any way to hide this or make it less verbose?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5681","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5681/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5681/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5681/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5681","id":150497653,"number":5681,"title":"Support

So here it is, the idea would be to remove the “Restart Code” step that we have to do after the installation of a new extension and which breaks the workflow (for instance if you have unsaved files you need to make a decision on them) and isn’t applied on every Code instances (cf. #3268).\n\nI understand that from a technical point of view, it is easier to restart the editor if its code base changed because of a new extension. However it should still be possible to implement some dynamic extension loading with the correct abstractions and some engineering effort. So I would be happy if this issue could host the discussion on the technical challenges involved and the willingness to make dynamic loading happen.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5675/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5674","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5674/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5674/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5674/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5674","id":150470074,"number":5674,"title":"Insert Tabs Instead of Spaces No Longer Works","user":{"login":"robbpriestley","id":16694050,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16694050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbpriestley","html_url":"https://github.com/robbpriestley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbpriestley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbpriestley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbpriestley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbpriestley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbpriestley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbpriestley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbpriestley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbpriestley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robbpriestley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291057332,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/verified","name":"verified","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-22T20:59:46Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T12:17:23Z","closed_at":"2016-04-25T07:03:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.0.0\n- OS Version: OSX El Cap 10.11.4\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
