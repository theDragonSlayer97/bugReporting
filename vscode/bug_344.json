we get a \"when\" clause context for when quick-open is in focus, but we don't have an entry for writing text? A use case would be if we bind \r\n\r\nworkbench.action.openNextRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup\r\n\r\nto another key than Ctrl-tab, since then the list of open editors remains until we confirm with Enter. It would be useful since we then could rebind a single key to selecting next/previous in that list, as opposed to having to use a modifier, i.e. we can use just \"n\" instead of \"Ctrl+n\"\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25458/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25457","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25457/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25457/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25457/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25457","id":224540006,"number":25457,"title":"Icons should support themes","user":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":308114150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/themes","name":"themes","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-04-26T17:16:45Z","updated_at":"2017-05-01T18:34:18Z","closed_at":"2017-04-27T08:03:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"#25328\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.12.0-insider (48ae6e3027be560d45dd1ebfbe090d6ff77af7f0, 2017-04-26T06:32:53.505Z)\r\n- OS Version: Linux x64 4.10.0-19-generic\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|EditorConfig|EditorConfig|0.9.3|\r\n|lorem-ipsum|Tyriar|1.0.0|\r\n|sort-lines|Tyriar|1.2.0|\r\n|theme-sapphire|Tyriar|0.1.0|\r\n|vscode-svgviewer|cssho|1.4.0|\r\n|tslint|eg2|0.12.0|\r\n|git-project-manager|felipecaputo|1.3.2|\r\n|md-navigate|jrieken|0.0.1|\r\n|vscode-scss|mrmlnc|0.6.2|\r\n|vetur|octref|0.6.3|\r\n|seti-icons|qinjia|0.1.3|;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8017\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2193314/25447256/59d9c09e-2a69-11e7-9b94-16ebaf30df2c.png)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4208","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"9CBF:3670:A52935:1A9D204:59D9372D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=345>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=343>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"4526d8311ee45a0f3c6d86d0fd7a4e13\"","status":"200 OK"}}
