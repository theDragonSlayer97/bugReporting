If I try the same files in an earlier version of code, they look closer to those in the atom examples. I added a pre 1.3.0 VSCode image to example 2. None of the other issues such as bold, italics, html, code blocks, or anything else have issues in earlier versions. These all seem to have been introduced recently when making markdown its own language I am guessing.\n\nI use markdown for writing documentation and blog posts, and this is the one thing keeping me from 100% moving to VSCode. The syntax is so poor that I have to continue using atom for things like blog posts, which is ironic since half my posts these days are about VSCode. I am adding a few pictures to show how bad VSCode is in comparison to Atom and point out some of the areas that need improvement.\n## Example 1\n\nVSCode\n![vscodemarkdown](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6662208/16732906/e9226dd6-4744-11e6-8309-9a542d6b88ce.png)\nAtom\n![atommarkdown](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6662208/16732930/043b1096-4745-11e6-815c-ecb307e3531d.png)\n## Example 2\n\nVSCode Pre 1.3.0\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6662208/16735454/b49cfdc4-474e-11e6-875c-dd1744a8e80f.png)\nVSCode\n![vscodemarkdown2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6662208/16732953/10a011f6-4745-11e6-87a7-c69dbeee6574.png)\nAtom\n![atommarkdown2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6662208/16732964/1a270522-4745-11e6-9ba2-18dcc22fc320.png)\n\nYou get the same poor results in pretty much every theme. \n\nA few of the issues that stand out:\n- adding bold or italics to a list breaks the coloring.\n  ![bolditalics](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6662208/16733515/7c2a2fea-4747-11e6-9a8b-05ce0673bbca.png)\n- Lists should appear like Atom with only the bullet being colored as seen in example 2 above.\n- Lists for sections like Jekyll blogs should properly highlight similar to Atom.\n  ![atomlistjekyll](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6662208/16733658/147b92c0-4748-11e6-98d9-45b99adb6835.png)\n  ![listjekyll](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6662208/16733665/18d6b73c-4748-11e6-9e8a-760d2af5a802.png)\n- Having multiple bold or italics words in the same line breaks the rest of the document.\n  ![vscodehtml](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6662208/16733830/c2a91d9a-4748-11e6-8ae6-c934f0e36b7a.png)\n  ![atomhtml](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6662208/16733833/c58f1b54-4748-11e6-96ed-3cb465e6310f.png)\n- Small amounts of html like <kdb> it can't handle if in a list\n  ![vscodehtmllist](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6662208/16733951/4dc39608-4749-11e6-9971-ceef68976b3c.png)\n- Lists break any syntax coloring in the line.\n  ![atomsyntaxlist](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6662208/16734057/bb391c94-4749-11e6-9efb-36a3b17d9ed7.png)\n  ![vscodesyntaxlist](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6662208/16734071/c7d1bcb8-4749-11e6-915a-8f0ad6b9a734.png)\n\nThere are likely some other issues, but they are escaping me right now. I will try to update this if I can remember any others.\n- VSCode Version: 1.4.0-insider\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Compare 2 theme between Atom and VSCode\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9075/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9074","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9074/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9074/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9074/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9074","id":164851404,"number":9074,"title":"Zoom + not working when I preview file","user":{"login":"thinkermao","id":7908062,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7908062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkermao","html_url":"https://github.com/thinkermao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkermao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkermao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkermao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkermao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkermao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkermao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkermao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkermao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinkermao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-11T14:30:46Z","updated_at":"2016-07-11T15:16:38Z","closed_at":"2016-07-11T15:16:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.3.0\n- OS Version: Win10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

Create a new TypeScript file in the src/app folder e.g. first.component.ts\n5. Insert code in file (see below)\n\nAs you can see now VSCode shows some errors in first.component.ts\n1.
