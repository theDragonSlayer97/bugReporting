pull request takes the subset of the work done for my Raspberry Pi / Chromebook builds that could be useful to have in the core code and adapts it for some of the restrictions encountered on Travis CI as discussed below.\r\n\r\nSome additions have been made to the Travis scripts to support reproducible ARM builds alongside the existing Linux and OSX amd64 builds.\r\n\r\nThe changes aim to keep the existing build configurations intact and operating exactly as before (listed in the YAML as &toolchain_linux_amd64 and &toolchain_osx_amd64) to prevent breaking anything.\r\n\r\nThe YAML has been re-structured to be a little more modular owing to the greater number of build configurations (listed under the **matrix:** node).\r\n\r\nThe intention of this pull request is to allow for additional cross-compilation targets to more easily be added to the Travis CI builds (with a view to expanding the officially supported platforms in the future), and provides hard-float ARM (armhf) and ARMv8 (arm64) configurations right now that should build immediately.\r\n\r\n_How this works_\r\n\r\nWhen the **CROSS_TOOLCHAIN** environment variable is set to **_true_** for a build configuration, an alternate toolchain will be prepared that uses the Travis CI trusty container, and re-creates the source packages list on the host VM to scope amd64 and i386 architectures to the main Ubuntu repositories, and the current target architecture (as defined by the **ARCH** environment variable) to the Ubuntu Ports repository.  Unfortunately, due to the Travis CI whitelist freeze, and the need to reconfigure dpkg for an additional architecture, **sudo** is required for this process, which slightly increases the bootstrap time for the build session (although in my testing no more than was already required for the OSX builds, and they happen in parallel).  As the automated testing currently runs on the amd64 builds (which happen faster due to not requiring sudo), this change should not increase the overall time for a given commit to build and \"greenlight\" successfully (in my test runs the cross-compilation builds generally finish before the amd64 builds have completed running tests/coveralls).\r\n\r\nAs some dependencies are historically not as well supported on other architectures as they are on amd64, it was necessary when re-creating the architecture-scoped package lists to point to the 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) repositories rather than the 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) repositories, not least as the cross-compilation step by GCC requires that the dependencies on amd64 and a given alternate architecture are version matched also.\r\n\r\nThe target architecture is provided in the form of a triplet (by way of the **GNU_TRIPLET** environment variable).  If the dependencies for a given target require multilib support, as is the case for the arm64 target, this can be provided by the **GNU_MULTILIB_TRIPLET** environment variable.\r\n\r\nThe **GPP_COMPILER** and **GCC_COMPILER** environment variables directly correspond to the **CXX** and **CC** variables, and overwrite them as a first step of the build script.  The reason for not directly setting the **CXX** and **CC** variables is that Travis CI will overwrite them for the **cpp** image while bootstrapping the build session, and this provides a workaround.\r\n\r\nnpm and Electron have a single ARM configuration at the present time which is broadly ARMv7l armhf, which is specified to the build script by way of the **NPM_ARCH** and **VSCODE_ELECTRON_PLATFORM** variables.  As ARMv8 is backwards compatible, this should not pose a problem for 64-bit users.\r\n\r\nSome repetition could have been saved by using the triplet name to build the g++ and gcc compiler references, but I decided against doing so as this does not hold true as a pattern for all targets (mingw, for example, has a slightly alternated naming convention).\r\n\r\nIn theory, adding support for architectures such as MIPS/PowerPC/SPARC should be as simple as adding a **matrix** entry and the triplet name, but I'm unsure if this is overkill as it seems unlikely that there would be demand on those platforms (old pre-2006 Macs that have since switched to Linux, maybe?).\r\n\r\nIf I can be of any assistance with this change please feel free to contact me on here or on twitter (@headmelted).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24943/reactions","total_count":78,"+1":61,"-1":0,"laugh":4,"hooray":6,"confused":0,"heart":7}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24942","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24942/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24942/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24942/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24942","id":222359533,"number":24942,"title":"Broken JsDoc intellisense","user":{"login":"VitalySenko","id":12730311,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12730311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalySenko","html_url":"https://github.com/VitalySenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalySenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalySenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalySenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalySenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalySenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalySenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalySenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalySenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalySenko/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":291055694,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/typescript","name":"typescript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":286886536,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-04-18T09:46:07Z","updated_at":"2017-04-18T16:06:53Z","closed_at":"2017-04-18T16:06:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

Request:\r\nI know this has been discussed at length, but I would like to bring up something more specific. I would like terminals to have every advantage that files have in terms of positioning and windowing. That would mean, that wherever you see a file opened in VSCode we could just as easily have a terminal there. At first, the feature request is merely about positioning of terminals, but eventually I imagine creating extensions that can register themselves as \"handlers\" for certain file types, and then when opening those files, the extensions can open in a terminal instead of text editor, but that would feel very integrated because those terminals are positioned and navigable just like regular files are. For example, imagine you have some binary file, and VSCode wouldn't know how to display anything but the random bits. Well, you could make an extension that handles that binary file type and opens in a terminal which opens it in some useful CLI inspector tool.\r\n\r\nAlso, I imagine that just allowing terminals to be open anywhere files are, might be a far simpler solution than some of the other proposed features for custom terminal positioning. This is a way to just avoid all the bikeshedding about some one-off behavior for terminal positioning, and my hope is that it's easier to implement since it can just reuse all the file windowing code. This way, when/if VSCode gets new window positioning features, terminals automatically benefit from it, too.\r\n\r\ncc @Tyriar \r\n\r\n(Somewhat related feature request, but not the same thing).\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10546\r\n\r\nI apologize if this exact proposal has been discussed somewhere - please feel free to point me to that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24921","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24921/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24921/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24921/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24921","id":222261633,"number":24921,"title":"A 'jsconfig.json' file was created to enable IntelliSense.
