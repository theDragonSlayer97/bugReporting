it stands today, he `files.trimTrailingWhitespace` setting, clears empty spaces at the end of all lines other than the current line. however this behavior is odd.\n\nThe only reason I can think of for doing this, is when you tab to start your line at the right position and then would be thrown back to pos0 if you should happen to save there.\n\nhowever if you have written an entire line, or copy pasted something with spaces at the end, and you save, they stay. And if you then close the file and commit it, you need another tool in place to catch your overlooked spaces.\n\n(on a side note, if you happen to save, and all but the current line's spaces are removed, you cannot just move 1 line down and save again. no, you need to add another space somewhere at the end, then move lines again and save to see all 2 lines being cleaned)\n\nbut to me, i'd rather see it adjusted so that it always clears all spaces on all lines including the current, except for when the only characters on that current line are spaces and/or tabs (meaning you probably just indented into a code block and wanted to save before starting on that codeblock's code)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1634","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1634/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1634/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1634/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1634","id":123792357,"number":1634,"title":"[sql]

really enjoying working with VSCode, and appreciate the work going on here.  One issue I'm having (OSX El Capitan) is that VSCode doesn't seem to recognize some of the system wide services keyboard shortcuts I've set up to work with text from any application.\n\nI have some System Services that run scripts, which I activate via a mouse menu, and those work fine.  I have others that I activate via the keyboard. For example, I have a System Service to take selected text and use a shell script to append it to a special file.  I have a mouse menu item that invokes that service via the the keyboard shortcut I've defined:  Cmd-Shift-Alt-Ctrl-A.  This works just fine, but I cannot invoke the same service using the actual keys on the keyboard.\n\nAll the shortcuts I'm using have  Cmd-Shift-Alt-Ctrl as the modifiers, so I don't think there are any conflicts with existing keyboard shortcuts.  Other system wide keyboard shortcuts do work, so I'm not sure what the issue is with these particular, OSX System Services related ones.  Is it a problem with the modifiers, or is there some issue currently with OSX system services support?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1627","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1627/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1627/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1627/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1627","id":123757365,"number":1627,"title":"Native

When you open them with code and save the file it says \"Permission denied\". So I have to run Code with right click as administrator and then choose \"open file\" to open the file. Once, it is not possible to simply drag&drop the file into the elevated Code. The other problem is, once I already have code instance running without elevated rights (say I have my project open and now I need to edit a config) I cannot get another instance with elevated permissions. UAC asks for permissions and a new Code window opens, but it is not elevated, when I save it says permission denied. I have to close my project before I can get an elevated Code instance.\n\nI don't know if that is a restriction of Windows but seeing that you can, for example, run a normal Powershell and an elevated Powershell side-by-side I think this should be possible. The optimal case of course would be if Code could elevate itself if it can't save a file because of insufficient permissions. But being able to run elevated and non-elevated side-by-side would already help a lot.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1614/reactions","total_count":52,"+1":52,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1613","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1613/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1613/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1613/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/1613","id":123640133,"number":1613,"title":"Avoid
