VSCode Version: Code 1.14.2 (cb82febafda0c8c199b9201ad274e25d9a76874e, 2017-07-19T23:34:09.706Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 6.1.7601\r\n- Extensions: none\r\n- typescript compiler: v2.4.2\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n1. create code:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nfunction f(p1: string)\r\n{\r\n\treturn [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"].findIndex(p => p == p1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. rename parameter `p1` to `p` using *Rename Symbol* command.\r\n\r\n**What is expected:**\r\n\r\nVS Code shows a warning that the name `p` conflicts with the name of the inner variable `p` (the parameter of the arrow function used as an argument to `findIndex`) and doesn't rename the parameter `p1`.\r\n\r\n**The actual result:**\r\n\r\nThere is no warning and the code is changed to this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nfunction f(p: string)\r\n{\r\n\treturn [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"].findIndex(p => p == p);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn fact, the code is corrupted now because `p == p` is always `true` and the parameter of the function `f` is not used anymore.\r\n\r\nMoreover, nor the intellisense nor the compiler complains, because the code is syntactically valid. Thus the damage remains unnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe same behavior is observed with ordinary functions (non-arrow).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32090","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32090/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32090/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32090/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32090","id":248430209,"number":32090,"title":"Core dump","user":{"login":"tSte","id":8778539,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8778539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte","html_url":"https://github.com/tSte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":293389403,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/freeze-slow-crash","name":"freeze-slow-crash","color":"eb6420","default":false},{"id":321092510,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"006b75","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-08-07T14:32:30Z","updated_at":"2017-08-14T18:40:40Z","closed_at":"2017-08-14T18:40:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I was just inspecting journal and found four VSCode core dumps - all of them are the same.

community!\r\n\r\nI'm happy user of Vim and VSCode :smile: \r\n\r\nOn Vim I can match Ruby, Crystal, Elixir, Lua, Julia `end` keywords using [matchit](https://github.com/tmhedberg/matchit).\r\n\r\nBy example, the following code is in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) on Vim:\r\n\r\n![ezgif-4-d0a15b60f4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3067335/29022601-a35ac1f2-7b2f-11e7-9067-fd6b626068ed.gif)\r\n\r\nWould be nice to have something similar on VSCode.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is something like `autoClosingPairs` configuration allowing `open` and `close` info:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"comments\": {\r\n    \"lineComment\": \"#\",\r\n    \"blockComment\": [\"=begin\", \"=end\"]\r\n  },\r\n  \"brackets\": [\r\n    [\"{\", \"}\"],\r\n    [\"[\", \"]\"],\r\n    [\"(\", \")\"],\r\n    { \"open\": [\"do\", \"if\", \"else\"], \"close\":

\"'\", \"close\": \"'\", \"notIn\": [\"string\", \"comment\"] },\r\n    { \"open\": \"\\\"\", \"close\": \"\\\"\", \"notIn\": [\"string\"] }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"surroundingPairs\": [\r\n    [\"{\",
