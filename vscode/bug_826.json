and its grammar gets applied to all output channels, not just mine. So not only my extension and other extensions using the same trick may clash with other output channels and each other, also some built-in features seem to stop working in all output channels - for example the file absolute paths detection stops creating links for the paths.\n\nI'm wondering if it's possible to somehow constraint a language to work only within a specific output channel? If not, would it be possible to add such feature?

Problem only occurs when the same file is present in two visible editors in the window.  The problem is dependent on where the cursor is at in the other editor.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Have a file with more than one screens worth of information in a split context:\n   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8662470/17994771/b8ee0ed2-6b10-11e6-9a8e-22977e89d889.png)\n2. Scroll to bottom line in left editor, and scroll to something like line 7 in the right editor:\n   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8662470/17994804/f04100b0-6b10-11e6-889d-d2e8046eed20.png)\n3. Now insert a new line after line 7 with \"ctrl-enter'.  Instead of just leaving the cursor and screen where it previously was and adding a new line, the right editor scrolls and makes file line 7 be screen line 1.  It then opens a new line on line 2:\n   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8662470/17994844/3e54ece4-6b11-11e6-9d3d-369b9faa3d63.png)\n\nThis is extremely annoying because there's a \"lurch\" and you lose your place as to where you are, plus you can no longer refer to the lines immediately above the inserted line.\n\n4)  If both editors are \"on the same page\", so to speak, and both showing roughly the same position, then the scrolling does _not_ happen, and insertLine works as expected:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8662470/17994911/d08da894-6b11-11e6-865e-a24d7f2c7f78.png)\n\nNote how in this screen shot, file line '7' is still at line 7 on the screen.\n\nThere's an interplay between the two editors when it comes to the logic about where to position the cursor.  As far as cursor position goes, they should be completely independent of each other.  If another file is open in the left window (file 'so_question.ts' in this screenshot), then the cursor in the right works as expected no matter where the cursor is positioned in it's twin (the non-visible editor).  So it's only _visible_ editors sharing the same file that this interference happens on.   \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10990","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10990/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10990/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10990/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10990","id":173367339,"number":10990,"title":"[Bug] Keybindings.json command is not surrouned by double quotes when auto-complete","user":{"login":"letientai299","id":8386780,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8386780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/letientai299","html_url":"https://github.com/letientai299","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letientai299/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letientai299/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letientai299/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letientai299/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letientai299/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letientai299/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letientai299/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letientai299/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/letientai299/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-26T04:21:49Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T07:16:26Z","closed_at":"2016-08-26T07:16:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04 \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
