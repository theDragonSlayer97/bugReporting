In this situation, if we want to send the formatted code or HTML snippet to the clipboard and makes it look reasonable, we have to do one of the followings\r\n\r\n1. Append the generated CSS rules from Theme to the HTML Dom elements of selected content and send them all to the clipboard. Even if you just select a few characters, we still have to put all the CSS rules in the payload. I know there must be some way to filter the CSS rules and reduce them as few as possible but it'll be real pain.\r\n2. Translate all the CSS Classes an element has to final styles, eg, `token meta function js definition parameters punctuation` to `color: #ffffff`. This one looks more reasonable but it requires a good engine to take care of the CSS rules.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Alex already did all the complex CSS calculation for us in the improvement I mentioned above, the drawbacks of #1 and #2 are already gone now. For #1, we reduced the amount of CSS rules to 10 or 20 in most cases so the payload is not that giant. For #2, since the whole theme/tokenization engine is based on colors directly instead of CSS Classes, we just need to read the color from memory.\r\n\r\n#2 is a better approach but as a POC, I still pick #2 then I can keep the code change minimal.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\nWe are not relying on the browser(Chrome) to handle the copy/paste as we can't guarantee that content users select in the editor exist in the DOM tree. This is because we only render content that are visible to users for the sake of performance. If users select content out of the viewport then we have to pay the price of rendering the invisible part to get the DOM elements with styles.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine the worst case is that ppl open a large file and copy the whole content. As most of the lines are invisible and we have to render all of them when copying, it's very likely to see lagging. So I tested against the three files Alex played with in https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/02/08/syntax-highlighting-optimizations#_tokenization-times on my powerfull MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015, 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7)\r\n\r\n\r\n| File        | Size           | Time of copying with rich text  |\r\n| ------------- |-------------| -----|\r\n| checker.ts      | 1.18 MB | 670ms |\r\n| bootstrap.min.css      | 118.36 KB | 55ms |\r\n| sqlite3.c\t      | 6.73 MB\t | 3100ms |\r\n\r\n`bootstrap.min.css` is good, `checker.ts`'s lag is noticeable and `sqlite3.c` is bad. But `sqlite3.c` is unusual and I bet you don't want to copy the content from Code and paste it to other applications. On my lovely machine, pasting the 6.73 MB content to Word takes **9 minutes**.\r\n\r\n`checker.ts` is not an usual case I suppose as it has 22000+ lines and copying the whole content and pasting doesn't always happen. But I still put this feature behind a boolean option and set its default value as false to avoid annoying most users who don't necessarily need it.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n- [x] [We do] Investigate whether we should switch to #1 as not all applications honor `<style>` tag in HTML entry in the clipboard. Word loves it but Evernote just ignores this element. Besides, browsers will transform all the classes to inline styles when you copy the content on a webpage, so maybe we should do the same thing. It requires some tweaks on `renderViewLine`.\r\n- [x] IE only support setting `Text` and `URL ` to the clipboard, `HTML` is not supported according to https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536744(v=vs.85).aspx\r\n- [x] Add a separate command for copy large files","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20241","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20241/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20241/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20241/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20241","id":206370585,"number":20241,"title":"Window jumps when moving cursor downwards if previewing markdown side by side","user":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":299344519,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/markdown","name":"markdown","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-02-09T00:40:19Z","updated_at":"2017-02-13T22:28:50Z","closed_at":"2017-02-13T22:28:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

Wait a day or so, while switching between various low-quality internet connections \r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/551184/22759733/2628fdbe-ee19-11e6-8553-9330e0828e54.png)\r\n\r\nNow, I'm aware that VS Code uses the internet for various features, including checking for updates and running `git fetch` on startup (or intermittently? not exactly sure when exactly it runs `git fetch`).\r\n\r\nBut VS Code should not require an internet connection unless I'm doing something like browsing the extension store, and it should not complain about lacking an internet connection while I'm doing literally nothing except leaving it open.\r\n\r\nThese errors are also kind of frustrating since they're not even telling me what VS is doing that needs an internet connection. A good error message tells me what failed and ideally how to fix it. The first two don't even tell me why I'm supposed to care that I don't have an internet connection, and the third doesn't tell me anything about what request it was or why it's initiating requests.\r\n\r\nLike, I don't mind tracking; I opt-into all tracking so it might have been something like that. Just don't show me error messages when your tracking fails; that's your problem, not mine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20231/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20230","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20230/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20230/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20230/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20230","id":206344030,"number":20230,"title":"Key binding to quick open in new split","user":{"login":"CrashyBang","id":2978850,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2978850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrashyBang","html_url":"https://github.com/CrashyBang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrashyBang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrashyBang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrashyBang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrashyBang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrashyBang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrashyBang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrashyBang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrashyBang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrashyBang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-08T22:24:05Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T07:03:53Z","closed_at":"2017-02-09T07:03:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

have an extension in the marketplace (gc-excelviewer) that fails to render its virtual document in VSCode 1.9 (Windows or Mac). Some users have reported this issue in 1.8.1 but I have not been able to see it for myself until now.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install the gc-excelviewer extension.\r\n2. Open a comma-delimited file with a .csv extension.\r\n3. Click the Open Preview button. The preview tab is created but remains blank.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the virtual document's containing <iframe> (with id=\"_target\") has been created with CSS attribute display: none (see [webview-pre.js](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/html/browser/webview-pre.js)).\r\n\r\nAlso in that file, in the following code block, newFrame.contentDocument.body is null:\r\n\r\n```// workaround for https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12865\r\n// check new scrollTop and reset if neccessary\r\nsetTimeout(function () {\r\n    if (scrollTop !== newFrame.contentDocument.body.scrollTop) {\r\n        newFrame.contentDocument.body.scrollTop = scrollTop;\r\n    }\r\n    document.body.removeChild(frame);\r\n    newFrame.style.display = 'block';\r\n}, 0);\r\n```\r\nAs a result, an exception is thrown, the display attribute is never set to block, and the virtual document remains blank. Note that if I tweak this attribute with Chrome Developer Tools then the virtual document renders correctly.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can't implement this workaround in my extension, as the parent <iframe> is not accessible to script code generated by the TextDocumentContentProvider.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20228","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20228/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20228/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20228/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20228","id":206312860,"number":20228,"title":"Android version of winulate windows emulation web based","user":{"login":"taibud007","id":25645620,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/25645620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taibud007","html_url":"https://github.com/taibud007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taibud007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taibud007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taibud007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taibud007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taibud007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taibud007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taibud007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taibud007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taibud007/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":386618042,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-02-08T20:20:35Z","updated_at":"2017-02-13T19:15:43Z","closed_at":"2017-02-09T07:05:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
