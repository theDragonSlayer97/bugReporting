(this is what \"tsc --init\" produces with additional `baseUrl` and `paths` properties.)\n\n``` js\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n        \"target\": \"es5\",\n        \"noImplicitAny\": false,\n        \"sourceMap\": false,\n        \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n        \"paths\": {\n            \"typescript\": [\n                \"/path/to/typescript/source/typescript.d.ts\"\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    \"exclude\": [\n        \"node_modules\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n1. hover on the \"ts\" symbol and notice it takes six seconds to resolve.  if it's fast, ctl-click on it once, then close the tab, and then hover it again.\n\nNote: /path/to/typescript/source/typescript.d.ts in my case is a very deep path into a network filesystem that is decently fast (it caches locally) but slower than an SSD.\n\nThe trace (from the `\"typescript.tsserver.trace\": \"verbose\"` setting) shows six seconds for the response to come back.\n\n```\n[Trace - 9:40:22 AM] Sending request: quickinfo (22). Response expected: yes. Current queue length: 0\nArguments: {\n    \"file\": \"/.../t/foo.ts\",\n    \"line\": 1,\n    \"offset\": 14\n}\n[Trace - 9:40:28 AM] Response received: quickinfo (22).

Unfortunately the log contains filenames that work probably doesn't want me to publish on a bug tracker, otherwise I'd publish it here.\n\nBut it looks like it's looking for node_modules/ and files like package.json, index.d.ts, typescripts.tsx, and so on, for every possible directory mentioned in that `paths` variable, despite us telling it where exactly to look.\n\nSpecifying a filename in 'paths' seems consistent with the module documentation written

Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install#install)\n2. Setup GOPATH\n   1. Choose a folder where you will be having the Go projects\n   2. Add env variable GOPATH with value as the above folder path\n   3. Create 3 folders \"src\", \"bin\" and \"pkg\"\n3. Run `go get github.com/golang/example/hello`\n4. Sideload the Go extension and open the folder $GOPATH/src/GitHub.com/golang/example in VS Code\n5. Open any Go file. You will see \"Analysis Tools Missing\" in the status bar. Click on it to install the Go tools that the extension needs.\n\n**Fix installation when goimports is the chosen formatting tool**\n1. Make a change in any of the Go file (hello.go), format the document, ensure formatting works\n2. Add this in the User Settings: `\"go.formatTool\": \"goimports\"` and repeat the above\n3. You should see an info box pop up saying that \"goimports\" was not found. Ensure that the command it asks you to use is `go get -v golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports`\n4. Click on Install\n5. Try formatting again. This time it should work.\n\n**Fix installation in Windows when goreturns is the chosen formatting tool**\n1. If you have `goreturns` installed already, then delete the exe\n2. Remove any customized setting you have for `go.formatTool`\n3. Make a change in any of the Go file (hello.go), format the document\n4. You should see an info box pop up saying that \"goreturns\" was not found. Ensure that the command it asks you to use is `go get -v sourcegraph.com/sqs/goreturns`\n5. Click on Install\n6. Try formatting again. This time it should work.\n\n**Add configurable flags for formatting**\nSee [PR 444](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/444) for testing steps\n\n**Use diff output from gorename to allow undo on rename operation**\n1. Rename a local variable in any Go file (hello.go), using F2 or right-click -> Rename Symbol\n2. Rename should be a success, file should be in an unsaved state and Undo should work\n3. Rename a function that is used across files. Ensure not all files that should be affected are open.\n4. Rename should be a success, all affected files should be open and in unsaved state and Undo should work\n\n**Auto-complete for package names that are not imported**. \n1. Set \"go.autocompleteUnimportedPackages\" in user settings\n2. Open a Go file that doesn't have the `math` import\n3.  Type `m`, the auto-complete should give `math` as an option. Choose this option, the word will get completed and an import to `math` will be added to your go file\n\n**Auto-complete for methods from packages that are not yet imported**. \n1. Set \"go.autocompleteUnimportedPackages\" in user settings\n2. Open a Go file that doesn't have the `math` import\n3. Type `math.`, the auto-complete will give all methods from `math` package as options. Choose any, the word gets completed and an import to `math` will be added to your go file\n\n**Updates to running Go tests**\nRefer to PRs #478 and #499 to get testing steps\n\n**Generate Unit Tests**\nRun below commands on `hello.go` and ensure a `hello_test.go` with test skeletons gets created.\n       \\* `Go: Generate unit tests for current file`\n       \\* `Go: Generate unit tests for current function`\n       \\* `Go: Generate unit tests for current package`\n\n**Changes to GOROOT and GOPATH in setting take effect immediately**\n1. Remove GOPATH env var. Launch VS Code. You should see the \"GOPATH\" not set message in the status bar\n2. Set GOPATH in User setting. You should be able to use all the Go extension features without needing to reload/restart VS Code\n\n**Do not allow to import already imported packages**\n1. Open `hello.go` and run the command `Go: Add Import`\n2. Ensure the already imported packages like `fmt` and `stringutil` do not appear in the quick open\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12653","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12653/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12653/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12653/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12653","id":179278945,"number":12653,"title":"Test: Setting for relative line numbers","user":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/26","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/26","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/26/labels","id":1944122,"number":26,"title":"September 2016","description":"","creator":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":471,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-16T05:20:24Z","updated_at":"2017-02-21T21:56:29Z","due_on":"2016-09-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-10-14T14:18:36Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-09-26T16:43:21Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T23:40:25Z","closed_at":"2016-09-27T23:40:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Test for (part of) #9561\n- File bugs against alex\n- [x] Any OS @dbaeumer \n\nComplexity - 3\n\nChange the setting `editor.lineNumbers` to `true`, `false` or `\"relative\"`.

VSCode Version: 1.5.3\n- OS Version: Windows 10 1607\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Install PowerShell extension\n2. Open folder C:\\Users{username}.vscode\\extensions\\ms-vscode.PowerShell-0.7.2\\examples\n3. Open file DebugTest.ps1\n4. Set breakpoint on line 10\n5. Press F5 to start debugging\n6. Hover over variable $I on line 2, 4 10.  Notice there is no debug hover\n7. Notice that upon the breakpoint being hit, the `Auto` pseudo-scope was open by default.\n\nWe really like that `Auto` opens by default.  This seems to happen because we mark the `Auto` scope as not expensive.  However, we also mark the `Local` scope as not-expensive.  Because the built-in VSCode debug hover doesn't work with duplicate variables, we lose debug hover.  That's painful.  Note: the variables in `Auto` are by definition duplicates of variables in `Local`.  The problem with `Local` is that PowerShell has a ton of built-in local variables.  With `Auto` we attempt to show the local variables that the user created.\n\nWe can fix debug hover by setting `Auto` back to expensive and then debug hover has only `Local` to search through but that causes `Auto` to not be open by default during debugging which is a bummer.  \n\nBTW we can't use supportsEvaluateForHovers because we can't make that impl side-effect free.\n\nI guess we could make `Local` expensive and `Auto` not expensive but then we lose debug hover on any of the built-in variables the user may use in their script.\n\nOne idea is that somehow we could inform VSCode that the `Auto` pseudo-scope is just another \"view\" (a filtered view) of the `Local` scope and therefore the \"don't display debug hover for duplicate variables\" rule does not apply.  Another idea, is that VSCode could manage an `Auto` filtered variables view and then there would be a \"displayInAuto\" field on variable to determine if the variable should be displayed in Auto.  Then when applying the duplicate variable rule for debug hover, you wouldn't count the variables in `Auto` as

I can start it using node command in terminal and VSCode easily attaches to that process for debugging, but not able to debug directly running application from VSCode.\n\nBelow is my launch.json\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Launch\",\n            \"type\": \"node\",\n            \"request\":

our global actions contributed from the workbench need to have exactly 2 arguments: ID and label. This makes it hard to contribute parameterized actions that take a context as argument (imagine you have 1 base class of action to toggle viewlets and you want to pass in the viewlet ID).\n\nTracing down the code it ends up in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/platform/actions/common/actions.ts#L176 where we have `IConstructorSignature2<string, string, Action>`\n\nI am not really sure who added this code to begin with but cc'ing some folks ( @joaomoreno @alexandrudima @jrieken ).\n\nMy proposal would be that you can pass in the `SyncDescriptor<Action>` into the `ctor` so that you can create any kind of descriptor before hand:\n\n``` typescript\nexport class SyncActionDescriptor {...\n   constructor(descriptor: SyncDescriptor0<Action>, id: string, label: string, keybindings?: IKeybindings, keybindingContext?: ContextKeyExpr, keybindingWeight?: number);\n   constructor(ctor: IConstructorSignature2<string, string, Action>, id: string, label: string, keybindings?: IKeybindings, keybindingContext?: ContextKeyExpr, keybindingWeight?: number);\n   constructor(arg1: any, id: string, label: string, keybindings?: IKeybindings, keybindingContext?: ContextKeyExpr, keybindingWeight?: number) {\n    this._id = id;\n    this._label = label;\n    this._keybindings = keybindings;\n    this._keybindingContext = keybindingContext;\n    this._keybindingWeight = keybindingWeight;\n    this._descriptor = arg1 instanceof SyncDescriptor ? <any>arg1 : createSyncDescriptor(arg1, this._id, this._label);\n}\n```\n\nChallenging part is that both `SyncDescriptor0` and `IConstructorSignature2` are interfaces so I cannot really do an instanceof

VSCode Version: 1.5.3\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n- Laptop: Asus n56-vz, I'm using Asus Smart Gesture drivers for touchpad.\n\nSuddenly touchpad scrolling stopped working.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1) Add a lot of code yo see a scroll bar.\n2) Try to scroll with 2-finger gesture - doesn't work;\n\nNot sure about the reason of this behavior.\nI've been using VSCode for several hours, than I turned my laptop into a sleep mode.\nAfter waking it up back, VSCode no more responses on a touchpad scrolling (with 2 fingers).\n\nI tried to reboot the system, no effect.\nI also tried to reinstall VSCode, but it seems like I haven't achieved complete removing (cause, for example, all my extensions were safe), so it didn't help too.\n\nHave anyone also faced with such an issue or maybe there are some tips to do in order to solve this

In addition VS Code's source code got adapted to TS 2.0.3. We need to test the TS functionality on a test workspace. Do the following:\n## Upgrade info:\n- create a new workspace and open VS Code. \n- you should see a message informing you about the fact that we upgraded to TS 2.0.3. We only show the message once so you might have already seen it. If so open the Dev tools and delete the following entry from local store:\n\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1931590/18836265/8d64bb28-83ff-11e6-9c88-13fcc7109558.png)\n- try again.\n## Feature testing\n- create a new workspace or take an existing workspace and upgrade it to TS 2.0.3 if you use a local typescript install update it to TS 2.0.3 (e.g. if you use typescript.tsdk).\n- test all TS functions like: error reporting, intellisense, goto definition, find references, format, format on type, hover, rename. ...\n- try things...\n- if the error is an 'obvious' TypeScript problem file the issue directly against the TS repository: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript. Otherwise file it against vscode.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12632","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12632/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12632/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12632/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12632","id":179218898,"number":12632,"title":"Jump
