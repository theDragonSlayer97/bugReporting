there. I searched the issue history for this repo and wasn't able to find this. Please forgive me if it already exists!\r\n\r\nThis is just a friendly request for the suggestion box: Currently, we are only able to write snippets in json5. It would be nice to have the ability to write them in yaml to make adding and arranging snippets easier.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be possible to load snippets in the same way as they are currently, but if `.yml`, `.yaml` files are found, just run them through a yaml parser (e.g. [`js-yaml`](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml)) prior to consuming in vscode? \r\n\r\nThanks for considering! 😄

Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.12.0 - insiders\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\n-- Sorry for the English, I used Google Translator --\r\n\r\nAfter a [long conversation](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19515#issuecomment-297827062) with @alexandrudima the same suggested that he open that issue.\r\n@alexandrudima, I do not know if that's what you imagined .. so feel free to edit.\r\n\r\nBy default all single and double quotation marks should auto close if you have `words + space`.\r\nBy default all single and double quotation marks should not close if it is next to the `word`. For single quotes should be considered apostrophe.\r\n\r\nHere are examples of how to share the quotes. Similiar to Atom and Sublime.\r\n\r\nEg1:\r\n![ex1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19866231/25551034/91decc26-2c55-11e7-8fa5-ebfb14e9ba40.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nEg2:\r\n![ex2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19866231/25551036/9756190c-2c55-11e7-8914-b9053f506301.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nAllow the same to be set up separately for comments. (This is the javascript that auto closes single quotation marks in code, but not when used in comments.) By default it should follow the above rules.\r\n\r\nThere may be a question of syntactic and semantic, depending on the language. So let the resource by language.\r\n\r\nThere are still letters that allow you to have apostrophes along with single quotes. It does not interfere with semantics and maintains syntax highlighting.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25658/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25657","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25657/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25657/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25657/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/25657","id":225218224,"number":25657,"title":"Monokai

It's annoying when they're not all available, so I want every search panel to always be set up like this. But these settings don't seem to persist:\r\n\r\n* Across restarts\r\n* In new windows\r\n* Across existing windows (so if I change the setting in one window, other windows aren't affected)\r\n\r\nI use all three features quite a lot, and hiding them behind little arrows and buttons isn't so great, especially since there's no keyboard shortcut to do any of them without some awkward tab-navigation. But it would be okay if these settings were simply remembered across windows and restarts.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit nonsensical that the settings are per-window, too.

Sublime and Atom do this, simply because replacing is a very, very common operation.\r\n* Always showing the include/exclude box, but move them to the bottom of the view so they don't clutter the UI.\r\n* Hiding the \"files excluded through settings\" field, which is arguably only useful when you have issues with the exclusions and could even be moved into the tooltip for the exclude button, since it's purely information and not editable.\r\n\r\nSome visual clutter could also be reduced by removing the counts.

files\"?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25650","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25650/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25650/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25650/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25650","id":225210229,"number":25650,"title":"View:
