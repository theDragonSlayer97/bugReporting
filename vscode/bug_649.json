VSCode Version: 1.8.0-insider\r\n- OS Version: OSX El Capitan 10.11.6\r\n\r\nUsing normal, path based imports, Peek/Go To Definition and CMD+Click to open file from import work wonderfully. When using a [Webpack alias](http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#resolve-alias), Peek/Go To no longer work. It kind of \"fails silently\" in that nothing appears (not even an error message).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add an alias to a webpack config file\r\n2. Import a file using an ES6 import with the path to the file that includes the Webpack alias\r\n\r\nDesired Behavior:\r\n1. Using a Webpack alias inside an ES6 import, Peek/Go To Definition display in the same manner as when using a full path inside an import. \r\n2. CMD+Click to Open File from import statement works with both full paths and webpack aliases\r\n\r\nI've created a reduced repo that demonstrates the behavior: https://github.com/damonbauer/webpack-alias-demo/\r\n\r\nI'm setting an alias in the [webpack config](https://github.com/damonbauer/webpack-alias-demo/blob/master/webpack.config.js#L13) to map the word `app` to the path of `/src`. Then in a file, I'm [importing another](https://github.com/damonbauer/webpack-alias-demo/blob/master/src/App.js) with ES6 imports.\r\n\r\nEdit: I'm also using the [PathIntellisense extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense) with custom mappings so I can get path autocompletion when using an alias in an import. Perhaps there could be something helpful in that repo?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16320/reactions","total_count":29,"+1":29,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16319","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16319/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16319/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16319/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16319","id":192821754,"number":16319,"title":"Powershell $PSScriptRoot (No simple way to run scripts)","user":{"login":"TheKnightCoder","id":24293640,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/24293640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheKnightCoder","html_url":"https://github.com/TheKnightCoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheKnightCoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheKnightCoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheKnightCoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheKnightCoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheKnightCoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheKnightCoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheKnightCoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheKnightCoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheKnightCoder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-01T11:35:15Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T17:04:18Z","closed_at":"2016-12-01T17:04:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.8.0-insider\r\n- OS Version: Windows 7\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. install powershell extension\r\n2. make a script using $PSScriptRoot   (directory of script)\r\n3.

while investigating #12837\r\n\r\n**Bug**\r\nTitle bar actions with same id but different arguments are not properly handled in `titleControl.ts`. An action with a command will not be replaced by a new one with the same command but a different argument.\r\n\r\nYou can see this in the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1. Create workspace with two md files, `a.md` and `b.md`.\r\n2. Open previews for both files.\r\n3. Open the preview for `a.md` again.\r\n4. Switch to the preview for `b.md`.\r\n5. Click the show source button in the `b.md` preview.\r\n\r\nThe editor switches to `a.md` instead of `b.md`.\r\n\r\nBoth the `a.md` and `b.md` previews register the same action (`markdown.showSource`) but with different arguments (the document URI in this case). We calculate these title actions correctly in both cases, but do not refresh them when switching to the `b.md` preview from the `a.md` preview because of this logic:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/editor/titleControl.ts#L402\r\n\r\nThat line looks only at the action ids, which are both `markdown.showSource`, so we do not update the action in the UI.\r\n\r\n**Potential Fix**\r\nCheck argument when comparing
