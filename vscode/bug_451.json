@bruceauyeung on March 7, 2017 8:45_\n\n`Finding all references` will popup a window to show all references, i think it's a little hard to use, i am not blaming vscode-go, maybe it's vscode's limitation because vscode don't provide a view similar with output, problem etc.\r\n1. once user close the popped-up window, referencing results is lost. user have to find all references again if they just closed the window by accident. most other IDEs such as Eclipse, Gogland, they display references in a view , the referencing results will not be lost until user do finding all references again.\r\n2. user may close the window by accident very easily.  currently the window have a close button, a window bar, if user single-click the left part of menu bar or drag the window  on left part of menu bar( mouse pointer becomes to a finger when hovering on it, this indicates user can do something ), window will be closed.\r\n\r\nso i suggest:\r\n\r\n1, if it's possible, display references in a view similar with problem etc, not in a popup window. if not, \r\n2, do not close window when left part of menu bar is clicked or dragged, only close window when close button is close or content part of window is double-clicked.\n\n_Copied from original issue:

avoid issues users have been having with the new default PS and also enable easier selection of their preferred terminal I'm proposing that on Windows^ only we show a quick pick to select a terminal

using a watcher task to run actions, sometimes you may only want to run an action against that single file instead of the entire project. The problem is that if you have existing matched problems, this will erase existing problem matches since they share the same \"owner\" property. This issue is referencing this problem #1397\r\n\r\nFor these types of tasks it would be beneficial to allow the \"owner\" property to be dynamically set via matcher. One way this could be achieved is via a Pattern Matcher. Using the tsc example from the [Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_background-watching-tasks) it might look something like below.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n    \"command\": \"tsc\",\r\n    \"suppressTaskName\": true,\r\n    \"tasks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"taskName\": \"watch\",\r\n            \"args\": [\"--watch\"],\r\n            \"isBackground\": true,\r\n            \"problemMatcher\": {\r\n                \"fileLocation\": \"relative\",\r\n                \"pattern\": {\r\n                    \"regexp\": \"^([^\\\\s].*)\\\\((\\\\d+|\\\\,\\\\d+|\\\\d+,\\\\d+,\\\\d+,\\\\d+)\\\\):\\\\s+(error|warning|info)\\\\s+(TS\\\\d+)\\\\s*:\\\\s*(.*)$\",\r\n                    \"file\": 1,\r\n                    \"location\": 2,\r\n                    \"severity\": 3,\r\n                    \"code\": 4,\r\n                    \"message\": 5,\r\n                    \"owner\": 1\r\n                },\r\n                \"watching\": {\r\n                    \"activeOnStart\": true,\r\n                    \"beginsPattern\": \"^\\\\s*\\\\d{1,2}:\\\\d{1,2}:\\\\d{1,2}(?: AM| PM)? - File change detected\\\\. Starting incremental compilation\\\\.\\\\.\\\\.\",\r\n                    \"endsPattern\": \"^\\\\s*\\\\d{1,2}:\\\\d{1,2}:\\\\d{1,2}(?: AM| PM)? - Compilation complete\\\\. Watching for file changes\\\\.\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis just sets the \"owner\" as the  matched File and removed the \"owner\" property from  \"problemMatcher\". This would make it where only problems matched to that file would be cleared when the watcher triggers again.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: Adding a few gifs showing an example use case.\r\n\r\n## Pester Unit

please add support for environment variable replacements in JSON file schema properties.\r\n\r\nEditing JSON files with vscode and the current schema support is great when using a relative path within a project or an absolute path when one is known. However, sometimes relative/absolute paths aren't possible. I believe there's already support for them in other JSON file contexts, but it doesn't look like the schema resolver is leveraging that code. (If it is, none of the syntax variations I've tried actually worked, and some of them crashed the JSON Language Server, requiring a
