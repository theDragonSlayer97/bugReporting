Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Use Help > Report Issues to prefill these. -->\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.14.0\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n- Terminal: Git Bash\r\n\r\nMy default terminal is `\"terminal.integrated.shell.windows\": \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Git\\\\bin\\\\bash.exe\"`.\r\n\r\nFor some reason that I do not understand, arguments are either not passed to bash correctly, or bash does not understand them. The default command is `\"command\": \"echo Hello\"`, but bash acts as if it just received `echo` (just prints a newline). Admittedly, I am new to vscode and I've never used tasks before 1.14, so this might just be user error or the fact I'm using bash. However, I figure the default case should work.\r\n\r\nThis bug prevents me from creating a build task for Haskell `stack`. I would like to do `\"command\": \"stack build\"`, but all bash sees is `stack`. My workaround is to do `\"command\": \"\\\"stack build\\\"\"`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Delete (or rename) old `tasks.json`.\r\n2. In the top menu select \"Tasks > Configure Tasks\".\r\n3. In command palette drop-down select the last item, \"Others: Example to run arbitrary external command\".\r\n4. In the top menu select \"Tasks > Run Tasks...\" and choose `echo` from the palette drop-down.\r\n5. In the command palette drop-down select the first item \"Continue without scanning the build output\".\r\n6. Check the Tasks terminal and notice the lack of `Hello`.\r\n\r\ntasks.json:\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\r\n    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format\r\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n    \"tasks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"taskName\": \"echo\",\r\n            \"command\": \"echo Hello\",\r\n            \"type\": \"shell\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\n> Executing task: echo Hello <\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTerminal will be reused by tasks, press any key to close it.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is also reproducible with using `args`, for example, the following doesn't work:\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\r\n    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format\r\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n    \"tasks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"taskName\": \"echo\",\r\n            \"command\": \"echo\",\r\n            \"args\": [\"Hello\"],\r\n            \"type\": \"shell\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by passing the entire command in escaped quotes.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\r\n    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format\r\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n    \"tasks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"taskName\": \"echo\",\r\n            \"command\": \"\\\"echo Hello\\\"\",\r\n            \"type\": \"shell\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\n> Executing task: \"echo Hello\" <\r\n\r\nHello\r\n\r\nTerminal will be reused by tasks, press any key to close it.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions:

the new external files option that TS plugins can provide: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/15308/\r\n\r\nWe currently allow TSServer plugin extensions to register themselves for custom language modes. The angular extension for example could register the angular plugin with support for the `ng-html` language. There were a few problems with the current implementation:\r\n\r\n1. We start automatically syncing all `ng-html` files with TSServer.\r\n1. If the angular plugin is not active, TS treats these `ng-html` files as TypeScript code\r\n \r\n**Potential Fix**\r\nOn potential fix we discussed previously: add a `plugin` property on `open` requests. TypeScript would look at the `plugin` property and only start validating the file if has the corresponding plugin.

is more a subjective plea/rant then a bug report itself.\r\n\r\nI remember back in ~jan/2017, hover tooltips used to work very well. Even if maybe they had a more humble formatting (ex: a simple JSON.stringify of the object).\r\n\r\nThen in some release around february or march we got things like the new node inspector protocol, and some changes in what the debug console uses as a source (in practice, making a lot of messages disappear from it, even if it is not VS code fault).\r\n\r\nAnother thing that maybe entered into account was the increase of usage of async/await (which breaks debug stacks I guess). Gets worse with TS+sourcemaps.\r\n\r\nSince then, debugging has never been the same. Hovering over variables rarely yield something (sometimes it works, sometimes it takes a bit of time). Now I dont even bother hovering anymore, I just go straight to typing the variable in the console or in the watch.\r\n\r\nNot to mention that using `console: \"integratedTerminal\"` became mostly mandatory, since who knows when you will be losing any message.\r\n\r\nSo, probably things are this way for a reason, probably I'm doing something wrong, and certainly I should help instead of ranting. Just wanted to let this out.
