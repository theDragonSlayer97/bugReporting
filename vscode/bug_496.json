I'm following the instructions in [How to Contribute](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#build-and-run-from-source) and attempting to build and debug a dev version of VSCode, but there seems to be steps missing. I can't figure out if it's supposed to be like that or if I'm missing something.\r\n\r\nI've successfully cloned, npm-installed, built and executed a dev version of Code and now I'm trying to get my stable (1.9.1) version to attach to the dev version.\r\n\r\nThe instructions say:\r\n\r\n> Using VSCode\r\n> \r\n> Install the Debugger for Chrome extension. This extension will let you attach to and debug client side code running in Chrome.\r\n> Launch the development version of Code with the following command line option:\r\n> OSX and Linux\r\n> \r\n> ./scripts/code.sh --remote-debugging-port=9222\r\n> Windows\r\n> \r\n> scripts\\code --remote-debugging-port=9222\r\n> Choose the Attach to VSCode launch configuration from the launch dropdown in the Debug viewlet and press F5.\r\n> \r\n\r\nBut the Attach stage doesn't work. The first error is that the Debugger for Chrome extension requires a URL in the config - but there's no URL entry in the Attach config of `launch.json`.\r\nSo I guess a URL to add and I get a second error - this time telling me that it cannot connect and also helpfully providing me with a (very long!) `file:///` URL that I appear to need.\r\nI replace the URL in launch.json with this new file URL and it still fails with the same error.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the Debugger for Chrome page, I find that the URL entry supports wildcards - I add a `*` to the end of the URL and it successfully attaches.\r\n\r\nIs this correct? Was I supposed to configure something else? Should it just work without the URL parameter? If not, could you update the docs.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20916","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20916/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20916/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20916/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20916","id":208842527,"number":20916,"title":"Extensions tab hangs forever","user":{"login":"SecSan","id":12697319,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12697319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecSan","html_url":"https://github.com/SecSan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecSan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecSan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecSan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecSan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecSan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecSan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecSan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecSan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecSan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":27,"created_at":"2017-02-20T10:42:00Z","updated_at":"2017-03-12T08:41:08Z","closed_at":"2017-03-09T08:10:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The extension tab hangs forever without showing any extensions (neither installed nor available in the marketplace).
