VSCode Version: 0.10.11\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nSee: https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode/issues/40 for more info and a screenshot\n1. Install editorconfig extension and create a .editorconfig file\n2. set insert_final_newline = true\n3. enable auto-save in vscode (using a delay)\n\nThis issue only occurs when the cursor is at last line, last character of the file when the 'TextEditor.insert' is called. After the insert, the cursor is moved to the end of the file (now with one more line, the last newline).\n\nThis does not happen when the cursor is at any other location in the file.\n\nE.g. set auto-save delay to 5000 (easier testing).\n\nRemove any content from the end of the file (so editorconfig will insert a newline) and (before auto-save kicks in) move the cursor a few places up.\n\nthe newline is added, and the cursor (and intellisense) are untouched.\n\nI first tried fixing this inside editorconfig itself, by saving the current selection before any inserts, then restoring that selection after the save, but it does not have an effect. \n\nAlso, because this does not happen when the cursor is not at the end of the file, it looks like an issue with vscode.\n\nAnd also, I don't think it's appropriate for an extension to fiddle with cursor positions after an edit/insert. This should be handled by vscode (Since intellisense could be visible at the time of the insert/edit).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4802/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4801","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4801/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4801/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4801/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4801","id":144648511,"number":4801,"title":"Define

Start debugging in VS Code by selecting a related launch profile in a TypScript project. See my example snippet below.\n3. Run necessary code so that the debugger is stopped on the breakpoint from step 1.\n4.
