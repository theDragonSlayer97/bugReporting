\"三代之時，天下有國千萬，言語不通。周既王，始有雅言。諸子著作，皆以雅言。及周道微，天下紛亂，言語異聲，文字異形。尤是楚語至不同也。秦始皇帝混一車書，獨用秦篆，各地方言日合。然至於許慎之世，說文解字之所錄，亦有同義而音異之字，多有「某地曰某為某」之訓。蓋天下文字雖一，而言語未統也。此上古音也。古語於語法異於今音，可見諸尚書。\"\n\n\nvar str2 = \"Chinese (汉语 / 漢語; Hànyǔ or 中文; Zhōngwén) is a group of related but in many cases mutually unintelligible language varieties, forming a branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Chinese is spoken by the Han majority and many other ethnic groups in China.

solution (done in terminals for example):\n- measure also a typical wide character width. e.g. : https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/editor/browser/config/configuration.ts#L70\n- when computing the width of the string use the wide character width where applicable. e.g. : https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/editor/common/viewModel/characterHardWrappingLineMapper.ts#L174\n- this will of course not help with all languages (like arabic, thai), but would be a first improvement.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1253","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1253/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1253/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1253/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1253","id":122029117,"number":1253,"title":"Strange
