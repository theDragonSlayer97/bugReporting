appears that the new insider release has changed the startup behavior of the debug adapter client which causes the PowerShell debug adapter to never start executing the script.  We've determined that this is happening because the `configurationDone` request isn't being send when no breakpoints have been created in the Debug workspace.  \n\nWas this intentional?  Should we change the expectations for this request in our code?\n\nSee the following bug for more details: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/196\n- VSCode Version: 0.10.12-insider\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Install PowerShell extension 0.5.0\n2. Open folder `c:\\Users<username>.vscode-insiders\\extension\\ms-vscode.PowerShell-0.5.0\\examples'\n3. Select the `DebugTest.ps1` file\n4. Switch to Debug workspace and start the debugger\n5. Observe that no output is written and you cannot pause the debugger.  This is because the PowerShell debug adapter never starts executing the script because it didn't receive the configurationDone request.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4570","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4570/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4570/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4570/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4570","id":142715904,"number":4570,"title":"translation:

VSCode Version: 0.10.12-alpha 3/22 build\n- OS Version: Windows 10 1511\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Install Powershell extension and restart\n2. Open folder Examples under the Powershell extension install dir\n3. Select the DebugTest.ps1 file\n4. Press F5 to run, now try to pause the program.  Note that there is no output and pause doesn't work.\n5. Now set a line breakpoint and press F5.  Now there is output and pause works.\n\nOur log file shows that when a breakpoint is not set, we do not get the configurationDoneRequest message.  We are counting on getting that message whether there are breakpoints or not.  BTW this is a regression from the currently shipping version of VSCode. \n\nThe debug protocol docs state this:\n\n```\n/** ConfigurationDone request; value of command field is \"configurationDone\".\n    The client of the debug protocol must send this request at the end of the sequence of configuration requests (which was started by the InitializedEvent)\n*/\n```\n\nAm I misreading this?  I believe it implies the configurationDoneRequest message gets sent even if there are no \"configuration requests\" to send.  But I'm not sure. \n\nRE https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/196 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4566","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4566/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4566/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4566/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4566","id":142703861,"number":4566,"title":"Replace dialog opens with the wrong field focused","user":{"login":"jcward","id":2192439,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2192439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcward","html_url":"https://github.com/jcward","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcward/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcward/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcward/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcward/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcward/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcward/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcward/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcward/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcward/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":398766855,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-find-widget","name":"editor-find-widget","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":578047123,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/under-discussion","name":"under-discussion","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-03-22T16:30:42Z","updated_at":"2017-05-23T00:30:58Z","closed_at":"2017-05-23T00:30:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 0.10.11 (commit: f291f4) downloaded today\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04 x64\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

Instead, the **Replace** field is focused. And `tab` moves the focus forward, to the little icons (one would have to know to `shift-tab` to get back to Find.)\n\n**ETA:** Ah, I suppose this changed at some point, I was comparing 0.10.11 Linux to 0.10.3 Windows.\n\nSo it becomes a question of which implementation is \"more better\". :p :)\n\nAlright, well, here's a list of editor software that focuses the Find input when pressing `Ctrl-H`:\n- Microsoft Office\n- Google Docs\n- GitHub in-browser editor\n- Sublime\n- Visual Studio 2015 (community / windows)\n- Atom 1.5.3\n\nVs. editors that focus Replace first:\n- Atom 1.0.2\n\nFeel free to bring others to my

@rebornix on March 16, 2016 5:19_\n\nWhile implementing a debug adapter, we need to declare what debug type it is like \n\n```\n\"contributes\": {\n        \"debuggers\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"Ruby\",\n                \"label\": \"Ruby Debugger\",\n                                ...\n```\n\nIt works perfectly when user set type as `Ruby` in their launch config while it breaks when users type `ruby` with the lowercase `r`. It somewhat confuses users of my tiny plugin. \n\nMeanwhile if I attempt to change the type value from `Ruby` to `ruby`, my extension will never be backwards-compatible. Is there any solid reason that we make it Case-Sensitive or is there any workaround? You know that we are likely to name our debugger as the language name, `Python` for any python related code, `PowerShell` for ps code, but users might get blocked if they type `python` or `Powershell`.\n\n_Copied from original issue:
