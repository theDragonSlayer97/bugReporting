The cursor is inside the word 'bar' on the 9th line. Notice that the highlighting in the scrollbar thinks line 9 is located 2 lines above where it actually is, and also notice that the highlighting in the scrollbar thinks the match on line 5 is located 1 line above where it actually is. Clearly, this must be because the scrollbar is not accounting for the word wrapped lines in this

could not find a way to do it so I guess it's a feature request.\r\n\r\nI have several tasks\r\n1. build 1: tsc build project 1\r\n2. build 2: tsc build project 2 (dependent on project 1)\r\n3. styles: node-sass\r\n4. clear: solution (deletes some files)\r\n\r\nI wanted to create new task to do clean build of all. So I created new task using `dependsOn`\r\nProblem is that new task is running all children in parallel with no dependencies which obviously does not work for me.\r\n\r\nProposal, change property `dependsOn` in following way:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n    \"dependsOn\": {\r\n        \"tasks\": [\"clear\"],\r\n        \"then\": {\r\n            \"tasks\": [\r\n                {\r\n

   \"tasks\": [\"styles\"]\r\n                }\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nall tasks in `tasks` array at given level can be executed in parallel, after finishing go to `then` and proceed.\r\n\r\ninterface:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface ITask {\r\n    tasks: (ITask | string)[];\r\n    then?: ITask;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively you could just add new property `subTask` - pointing to task that needs to be build before.\r\nI would be enough to get dependencies, simpler to implement - but it would require to create a lot of fake tasks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32879/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32878","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32878/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32878/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32878/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32878","id":251624629,"number":32878,"title":"Terminal

regexp to extract evaluated expression: (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/debug/electron-browser/debugHover.ts#L139)\r\n\r\n```\r\n// If there are non-word characters after the cursor, we want to truncate the expression then.\r\n// For example in expression 'a.b.c.d', if the focus was under 'b', 'a.b' would be evaluated.\r\nif (matchingExpression) {\r\n\tlet subExpression: RegExp = /\\w+/g;\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor most programming languages this works ok, but not for OCaml whose identifiers can contain apostrophes: \r\n```\r\nlowercase-ident ::= |

hover over `a'` variable, VS code tries to evaluate `a` instead (see https://github.com/hackwaly/vscode-ocaml/issues/110)\r\n\r\nCan this regexp be made configurable so that an extension could change it if necessary?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32873/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32872","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32872/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32872/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32872/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32872","id":251591398,"number":32872,"title":"Output

If the find results window is open, text in that will be included in the selection.\r\n5. Copy with the current selection.
