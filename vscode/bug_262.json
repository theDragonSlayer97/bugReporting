It is weird to disable build in extensions trough settings and user installed extensions trough the extension view.\r\nBecause an user can read a description on the usage of an extension, they may found out why certain behaviour is implemented, for example tab-to-expand with Emmet.

Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.12.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a mix JS and TS project\r\n2. Use an absolute import in a JavaScript file (.js extension, to be 100% clear), like \r\n\r\n`import {FilterBar, SearchVm, sortByCaptions, sortDateCaptions} from 'tasks/list/searchVm';`\r\n\r\nThe existence of a tsconfig file makes the typing / intellisense not work for this import.  I've confirmed that deleting the tsconfig.json file (temporarily) causes everything to work correctly.  I thought maybe having a tsconfig could be a substitute for a jsconfig, so I also tried deleting jsconfig.json, but that didn't work either.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMaking the import relative, ie \r\n\r\n`import {FilterBar, SearchVm, sortByCaptions, sortDateCaptions} from '../searchVm';`\r\n\r\nalso fixes this, and causes correct type inferences / intellisense to work fine, so it does seem VS Code can't find my baseUrl setting in jsconfig.json when there's also a tsconfig.json file.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIs there some setting I need so my jsonfig.json file be respected, if there's also a tsconfig.json file?\r\n\r\nFor completeness, this is my tsconfig file\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n        \"target\": \"esnext\",\r\n        \"baseUrl\": \"./src\",\r\n        \"jsx\": \"react\",\r\n        \"allowSyntheticDefaultImports\": true,\r\n        \"allowUnreachableCode\": true,\r\n        \"allowJs\": true,\r\n        \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\r\n        \"module\": \"es2015\",\r\n        \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\r\n        \"lib\": [\"es2015\", \"dom\"],\r\n        \"typeRoots\" : [\"./typings/modules\", \"./node_modules/@types\"]\r\n    },\r\n    \"include\": [\r\n        \"./src/**/*.ts\",\r\n        \"./src/**/*.tsx\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this is my jsconfig file (some properties may not be needed - prior to opening this case I copied pretty much all of the tsconfig config in there, but since the file's not in git I'm not sure what was there before)\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"compilerOptions\": { \r\n        \"target\": \"esnext\",\r\n        \"baseUrl\": \"./src\",\r\n        \"jsx\": \"react\",\r\n        \"allowSyntheticDefaultImports\": true,\r\n        \"allowUnreachableCode\": true,\r\n        \"module\":
