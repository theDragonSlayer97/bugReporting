I then wondered if the publish had silently failed somehow, so I published a minor 1.0.1 update, and that seemed to work. After I used it for a few minutes, I found a minor issue that I wrote a small fix for, and then published a 1.0.2 update, and though it appeared in the marketplace as it should, I was unable to update from 1.0.1. After I restarted vs code, the extension failed to load at all and I discovered that the extension folder had only a manifest file and none of the other files in the extension package. I tried then installing it from the command line and got an HTTP 500 error.\n\nI then tried unpublishing and republishing, to no avail. I also tried updating the version to 1.0.3 and though the publish appeared to complete successfully, VS Code refuses to download and install it locally. I have verified with a friend who lives in different country and uses a different OS, and he is experiencing the same issue.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Verify that the extension exists in the marketplace: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NathanRidley.autotrim\n2. Try to install it in vs code (\"autotrim\")\n3. Error: \"extension not found\"\n4. Try installing from command line\n5. \"Extension 'NathanRidley.autotrim' not found.\"\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/298883/18776079/126ca270-81aa-11e6-8100-ba6db800cf78.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/298883/18776179/d0ca7dc8-81aa-11e6-907a-dff7233dd266.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/298883/18776189/e52d2fcc-81aa-11e6-990b-f01070321626.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/298883/18776199/fb44c0ae-81aa-11e6-9250-58260f165f78.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12496","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12496/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12496/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12496/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12496","id":178766045,"number":12496,"title":"filename

{\n        \"prefix\": \"MyInput\",\n        \"body\": [\n            \"<input type=${Type} name=${Name} id=${Name} value=${Value}>\"\n        ],\n        \"description\": \"Enters a full input tag

The same thing happens for any user defined snippet that I have created so I'm thinking that either my snippets are coded incorrectly or there is some type of glitch.  Instead of getting \"text\" when I hit the `TAB` key I get `<text></text>`.  If I undo my typing and then type `myinp` all over again and tab through the process, I get the desired result.\n\nLanguage for demonstration purposes is basic HTML.\n\nPlease watch the video inserted

VSCode Version: 1.5.3\n- OS Version: 10\n\nSome spanish localizations are \"weird\" according to MS standards, or even wrong. So far I've found these:\n- \"**About**\" > currently \"**Sobre**\", usual MS string on other products: \"**Acerca de...**\". \n- \"**Format code**\" (right click menu), currently \"**Código de formato**\". The translator interpreted \"**Format**\" as a name, not as a verb. Looks like a direct translation from a translation tool. Right translation would be \"**Dar formato al código**\".\n- Right click menu , \"**Cambiar todas las repeticiones**\", should be \"**Cambiar todas las ocurrencias**\".\n\nAll the rest seems to be fair accurate.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4586","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"961D:366E:775827:FB8175:59D9410B","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=777>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=775>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"0c10ef53f927c509025648c86a9b9f67\"","status":"200 OK"}}
