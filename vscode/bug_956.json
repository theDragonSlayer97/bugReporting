PSReadLine is an example of one Module that breaks. One example that could cause problems in your code, is if you are testing something with parts of the registry, the 32 bit console is going to give you bad results since it will be giving you results

Do a snippet with a default value and multiple locations.

VSCode Version: 1.2.0-insider\n- OS Version: Windows Server 2008 R2\n\nAs discussed in issue #327, the `autoClosingBrackets` option has some edge cases where it does not speed up typing but actually increases the work necessary. One of these cases is when I try to replace quotation marks as start and end character of strings.\n\nSteps to Reproduce: \n1. Open a TypeScript file\n2. Select a single quoation mark (')\n3. Trying to replace it with double quotation marks (\") leads to a a single quotation mark wrapped in double quotation marks (\" ' \"; I added the spaces to make it more readable)\n\nThe same issue occurs when I use the grave accent to replace double quotation marks. It would be great if VS Code could detect the intention and overwrite the selected character or replace the start and end chartacter of the string (e.g. 'Hello World' becomes \"Hello World\" or `Hello World` based on the new character).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7092/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7091","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7091/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7091/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7091/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7091","id":157888790,"number":7091,"title":"run all tasks with `isBuildCommand` flag set on build (all isTestCommand on test)","user":{"login":"aleksey-bykov","id":937933,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/937933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksey-bykov","html_url":"https://github.com/aleksey-bykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksey-bykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksey-bykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksey-bykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksey-bykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksey-bykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksey-bykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksey-bykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksey-bykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksey-bykov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":292032114,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/tasks","name":"tasks","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-01T11:56:55Z","updated_at":"2017-03-28T09:11:34Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:   1.1.1\n\nCurrently the first task with the `isBuildCommand: true` is run as the build command regardless of other tasks with the same flag.

It seemed to work perfectly fine before.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7074","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7074/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7074/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7074/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7074","id":157740724,"number":7074,"title":"[Feature request] Show errors/warnings in 'pinnable' panel","user":{"login":"bastienJS","id":5945955,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5945955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastienJS","html_url":"https://github.com/bastienJS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastienJS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastienJS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastienJS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastienJS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastienJS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastienJS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastienJS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastienJS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastienJS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-05-31T18:38:18Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T08:08:45Z","closed_at":"2016-06-01T08:08:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Due to this issue: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7033\n\nI would like to have a pinnable error/warnings dialog on the bottom/top/whatever side.\n\nThank you for not moving this feature request to 2017 :-)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4407","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"8CD3:4299:5AF6E9:CAF5EF:59D944AF","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=957>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=955>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"c7c2d66094389f12518135f56724f97b\"","status":"200 OK"}}
