After attempting to use \"Format Document\",  the code looks as follows:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7736675/24591381/ea8da06e-17cd-11e7-9045-59793b0cfaf1.png)\r\n\r\n2.  using npm install js-beautify version 1.6.12  we get:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7736675/24591392/33729d8e-17ce-11e7-9bec-931532f0a3f5.png)\r\n\r\n3.  this is similar to what we get using the beautify function in notepad++\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7736675/24591399/4d27c9de-17ce-11e7-9c0e-d7abe66eae08.png)\r\n\r\n4.  due to the huge size of this library and its connection to an internal program,  I can't really post it for validation.

Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: win10 x64\r\nMy monitor native resolution is 1920x1200\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nWhen opening any file in VSCode, it shows only **56 lines** at any time.\r\nI feel that the current line height and font size are too much by default.\r\n\r\n_For reference:_\r\n\r\n```\r\nSublime Text 3: 71 lines \r\n Notepad++ 6.9: 65 lines\r\n      gVim 7.4: 66 lines \r\n  UltraEdit 23: 67 lines\r\n```\r\n_In contrast, Atom 1.15 displays even less: 49 lines_\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nBy default VSCode has in its settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"editor.fontSize\":  14,    // Controls the font size in pixels.\r\n\"editor.lineHeight\": 0     // Controls the line height. Use 0 to compute the lineHeight from the fontSize.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I set them to **13** and **15** respectively\r\nthen the visible lines area becomes on par with the other editors: 71 lines.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nAlso, _(while using the default `Dark+` theme\r\nand the default setting `  \"editor.fontFamily\": \"Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace\"`)_\r\nwith my suggested settings, 13pt Consolas *I think* it is appears a bit boldish.\r\n_Changing the value`\"editor.fontWeight\": \"normal\"` to anything below 400 doesn't make a difference. (related issue: #381)_\r\nThat's why I believe that, in conjunction with the above two suggested changes, \r\nit would be even better to switch to a slightly different font that would support setting `fontWeight` below 400 e.g. something like \"Consolas Light\" -I know that this font currently doesn't exit- )\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n**So, my suggestion is to change the default values of these settings to 13 and 15 respectively, \r\nplus lower the `fontWeight` value somehow**\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\nHere is VSCode with its default settings:\r\n[screenshot
