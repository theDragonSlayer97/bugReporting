VSCode Version: 0.10.14-insider\n- OS Version: Windows 10 1511\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Install PowerShell extension\n2. Open Examples folder under the PowerShell extension directory\n3. Set a breakpoint in DebugTest.ps1 on any line (with script on it).\n4. Close VSCode and from Windows explorer or console, rename DebugTest.ps1 to DebugTest2.ps1\n5. Reopen VSCode and the Examples folder.  Note in the Debug view, the breakpoint is still set on DebugTest.ps1\n6. Select the DebugTest2.ps1 file and start debugging the script. \n7. Note that there is no indication that the breakpoint in the Debug view didn't get set. \n\nI would have expected at least the tooltip to display the message that we return from the debug host e.g.:\n\n``` javascript\n    {\n      \"type\": \"response\",\n      \"request_seq\": \"2\",\n      \"command\": \"setBreakpoints\",\n      \"success\": true,\n      \"body\": {\n        \"breakpoints\": [\n          {\n            \"verified\": false,\n            \"message\": \"Source does not exist, breakpoint not set.\",\n            \"source\": \"c:\\\\Users\\\\Keith\\\\.vscode-insiders\\\\extensions\\\\ms-vscode.PowerShell-0.5.0\\\\examples\\\\DebugTest.ps1\",\n            \"line\": 23,\n            \"column\": null\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n```\n\nI get that the message is normally meant for the tooltip on the breakpoint glyph in the editor gutter but if the user doesn't happen to have that file open (or it does not exist anymore), they won't see the error.  \n\nI think the breakpoints list in the Debug should \"reflect\" breakpoints that failed verification and provide the user with a way to see the message returned by the debug host.\n\nhttps://github.com/Powershell/PowershellEditorServices/issues/195 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4934","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4934/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4934/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4934/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4934","id":145837667,"number":4934,"title":"Remove unnecessary values from intellisense popup","user":{"login":"mikecann","id":215033,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/215033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecann","html_url":"https://github.com/mikecann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-04T23:54:04Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T08:49:55Z","closed_at":"2016-04-05T10:33:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 0.10.11\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

It would be great if those showed up in intellisense, which would make composing applications a lot easier. This of course applies to more than just components.\n\nI propose that support for Angular2 be added, and it should be implemented as an extension.

package and doesn't already have Git installed.  While most experienced Linux users will run this command frequently, I don't think we should count on everyone knowing this—even they may not know what's causing this.  At a minimum we should give a hint \"Hint: did you run `apt-get update` on the terminal before installing this package?\".  However, it would be even nicer if we could do this for them.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Go to http://code.visualstudio.com/Download?insiders=true\n2. Download the \".deb\" version\n3. Open it and attempt to install it in the \"Ubuntu Software Center\"\n4.
