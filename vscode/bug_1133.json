approach of maintaining a task using two different files seems more pain than necessary to me. May I suggest a few improvements to the way projects are administered in VS Code:\n<br/>\n### Add `npm install` context menu to package.json file\n\nWhen cloning a project from GitHub or after editing the `package.json` file in VS Code, no Node module is getting downloaded. So currently it's required to leave VS Code and execute `npm install` in a command prompt.\n\nI suggest to add a context menu item to the Explorer when a `package.json` file is selected to simplify this task. The context menu item is suggested to run `npm install` from the directory of the `package.json` file:\n\n![package](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9283914/12097398/d07d5402-b31b-11e5-961a-c3cb0e03769d.png)\n<br/>\n### Use `pragma comment` for running tasks in VS Code:\n\nMaintaining two distinct files to have tasks get run in VS Code seems more administration pain than necessary.\n\nI suggest to support a pragma comment preceding a task, fulfilling the same purpose as the `tasks.json` file does:\n\n``` javascript\nvar gulp = require(\"gulp\");\nvar ts = require(\"gulp-typescript\");\n\n//# task { isShellCommand: true, isWatching: true, problemMatcher: \"$tsc\" }\ngulp.task(\"tsc\", function () { gulp.src().pipe(ts).pipe(gulp.dest()); })\n```\n\n(The `tasks.json` file may still be applied, e.g. for legacy/compatibility purposes or if a complex task configuration needs to be set. If both, a `# task` pragma comment and an entry in the `tasks.json` file existed for a task, any of the two definitions would prevail.)\n\n<br/>\n### Add `Run Task` context menu to any `.js` file containing a `# task` pragma comment\n\nCurrently, running a task requires much typing.\n\nI suggest to add a context menu to Explorer for any `.js` file containing a `# task` pragma comment so tasks can easily be browsed for and a task can simply be started by two clicks:\n\n![run task](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9283914/12098333/f1cc0666-b321-11e5-8f50-cfc10fae09db.png)\n\nThe tasks in the list should be alphabetically sorted and the first task name letter should be used for the mnemonic, so starting a task could be as easy as `CTXT, T, L` for \"less\" or `CTXT, T, T` for \"tsc\" in the above screen shot.\n<br/>\n### Add option to automatically start tasks\n\nWhenever a project is opened in VS Code, which is indicated by the following preconditions:\n- a folder gets opened which contains one or more `.js` files\n- any of those `.js` files contains one or more `# task` pragma comments\n- any of those `# task` pragma comments comes with an `autoStart: true` property set\n\n... then the tasks marked with `autoStart: true` should automatically be executed.\n\nHere's a screenshot depicting how the `autoStart: true` property is suggested to be applied:\n\n![auto run 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9283914/12098517/2161e340-b323-11e5-854d-c4357cef5c60.png)\n<br/>\nDepending on user/workspace settings, a confirmation dialog might be displayed before the tasks are automatically getting started:\n\n![auto run

It seems like the [processRunnerDetector](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/tasks/node/processRunnerDetector.ts) would need to be augmented to add support, parsing the output of `npm run` or `npm run-script` (same thing / alias)\n\nCurrently I have the following `tasks.json` defined (credit to [David Anson](https://dlaa.me/blog/post/vscodenodetask))\n\n``` js\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"command\": \"npm\",\n  \"windows\": {\n    \"command\": \"npm.cmd\"\n  },\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      // Build task, Ctrl+Shift+B\n      // \"npm install --loglevel info\"\n      \"taskName\": \"install\",\n      \"isBuildCommand\": true,\n      \"args\": [\"--loglevel\", \"info\"]\n    },\n    {\n      // Test task, Ctrl+Shift+T\n      // \"npm test\"\n      \"taskName\": \"test\",\n      \"isTestCommand\": true\n    },\n    {\n      // \"npm run lint\"\n      \"taskName\": \"lint\",\n      \"runtimeArgs\": [\"run\"]\n    },\n    {\n      // \"npm run create-migration\"\n      \"taskName\": \"create-migration\",\n      \"runtimeArgs\": [\"run\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAs a side note, I have some scripts that take in user input, either from stdin, or from environment variables.  For example I deploy to my cloud provider of choice using `VERSION=1.0 npm run deploy` so it would be nice if I could specify an environment variable ahead of time.  Also, other scripts take in user input on stdin, such as `npm run create-migration <name>` which requires the user to specify a name for the new database migration

Ctrl+Shift+S is `Save All Files` in VS and I think it should be the same in VSCode.  I use \"save all files\" **way** more often than saving a file to a different name.  That is actually a pretty rare occurrence for me.  And VSCode already handles the case where you press Ctrl+S to save a file that doesn't have a name yet.  That particular case is by far the most common case for \"Save as\" and it's already covered by Ctrl+S.  Plus it helps the transfer of learning when coming over from Visual Studio.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1760/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1759","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1759/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1759/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1759/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1759","id":124690988,"number":1759,"title":"Add \"join line\" keyboard shortcut","user":{"login":"jkup","id":490294,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/490294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkup","html_url":"https://github.com/jkup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkup/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-01-04T03:32:24Z","updated_at":"2017-04-27T19:10:30Z","closed_at":"2016-12-16T19:10:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This is a feature request!
