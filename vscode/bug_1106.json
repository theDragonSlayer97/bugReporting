great feature of VS Code is that it's aware of npm package names and their latest versions — it pulls them down to provide auto-complete in the `package.json` file.\n\nThis feature can be extended to provide a feature that a recent cool [webpack plugin](https://github.com/ericclemmons/npm-install-webpack-plugin) has been enabling — to automatically update the `package.json` with a required/imported npm module (as you type it), and also `npm install` it in the background. I think VS Code has enough smarts to be able to do this natively and even provide helpful feedback such as when the package wasn't found. This will take its Intellisense to another high level.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2589","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2589/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2589/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2589/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2589","id":130183773,"number":2589,"title":"Cant
