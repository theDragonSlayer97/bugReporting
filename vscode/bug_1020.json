Click \"F3\" to jump to the \"Next match\"\n\nThe fonts are rendered with blur.\n![screen_blur](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6037811/14419649/cef9e610-fff9-11e5-8941-dde568c84570.png)\n\nIf I pressed \"Ctrl+Home\" to \"reset\" the rendering, then use mouse to scroll to that line, the fonts are clear and sharp.\n![screen_clear](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6037811/14419651/d2130afc-fff9-11e5-9fa5-da68d839d603.png)\n\nThe details of the fonts are as below:\nblur:\n![blur_detail](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6037811/14419664/eff0d0f4-fff9-11e5-9d31-9a18f4ab6ef2.png)\n\nsharp:\n![clear_detail](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6037811/14419671/fca5f842-fff9-11e5-8192-4d8ee3bd89c8.png)\n\nIt seems the **height** of blurred font is **16px**, and the \"normal\" font is **15px**.\n\nBecause the monitor in my company is 22\" 1920*1080, the default font size of VSCode is too small. Though we can modify the \"editor.fontSize\" setting, but the font-size of side bar will still be very small, so I think zoom in once is the most comfortable way to make text easy to read...if without this issue.\n\nAnd I think it's not a duplicate of
