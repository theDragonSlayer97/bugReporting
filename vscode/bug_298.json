is a follow-up on https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues/187\r\n\r\nIn vscode-java, completion item labels are formatted as `type - package`, because we find it more [user friendly](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues/47) to display the package immediately, instead of relying on selecting the item to show the details content. This is how all Java IDEs present autocompletion results anyway.\r\n\r\nBecause the label contain spaces, autocompletion doesn't stop when typing a space, which is [annoying](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues/187).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"652\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-19 at 9 48 50 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/148698/25183422/8cf94726-24e5-11e7-9d5b-9f53b9c8183a.png\">\r\n\r\nSo we tried using [filterText](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/versions/protocol-2-x.md#completion-request) instead, as the protocol states: \r\n\r\n```js\r\n/**\r\n * A string that should be used when filtering a set of\r\n * completion items. When `falsy` the label is used.\r\n */\r\nfilterText?: string;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo our completionItems now look like\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"label\": \"Map - java.util\",\r\n   \"kind\": 7,\r\n   \"sortText\": \"zzzzzzzbge\",\r\n   \"filterText\": \"Map\",\r\n   \"data\": {\r\n       \"decl_signature\": \"Ljava.util.Map;\",\r\n       \"pid\": \"62\",\r\n       \"rid\": \"6\",\r\n       \"uri\": \"file:/Users/fbricon/Dev/vertx-game-server/src/main/java/com/redhat/middleware/keynote/GameUtils.java\"\r\n     }\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut vscode still seems to filter using the label\r\n![may-15-2017 13-24-42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/148698/26070249/ef46c688-3971-11e7-8694-0a59fc6d7cea.gif)\r\n\r\nTo which  @jrieken replied:\r\n\r\n     Yeah, we always try with the label first and use the filter text only when not matching the label. \r\n     Mostly because when using the filter text we cannot render the blue highlights. But it could be \r\n     considered a bug on our side\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to decouple filtering from highlighting here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26873","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26873/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26873/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26873/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26873","id":229713710,"number":26873,"title":"resourceLangId == 'azcli' not matching untitled file","user":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":421131022,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/as-designed","name":"as-designed","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-05-18T15:24:34Z","updated_at":"2017-05-19T14:58:32Z","closed_at":"2017-05-19T14:58:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.13.0-insider (2fbc979be2bd0fec6dc2af713367b2930f818121, 2017-05-17T08:10:06.896Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 15.6.0\r\n- Extensions: Many\r\n\r\nThe Azure CLI extension is using `resourceLangId == 'azcli'` to scope keybindings and menu items to the language id it contributes.

The ```FileSystemWatcher``` then have 3 read only properties that just tells me which parameters I used to create it, that does not seem very useful and looks like an internal implementation detail that have leaked into the public API. If there is some argument for keeping them, then I suspect that the same argument could be used for the ```globPattern```.\r\n\r\nI then have to set a callback for each of the events - why would I tell the ```FileSystemWatcher``` to ignore an event and then provide a callback for it or tell it not to ignore an event and then not provide a callback for that event?\r\n\r\nTo encourage extension developers to only watch what they need, I think it would be better if you had to opt in to which events you want to watch. I assume that is also the reason for having the ```globPattern``` in the first place.\r\n\r\nAdding ```watchXxxxxxEvents``` properties and deprecate the ```ignoreXxxxxxEvents``` might also be a way to fix #26851 in a non-breaking way. Making them read+write would also be useful for temporarily pausing the watcher without having to completely tear down and re-create the watcher. It is easy to forget to call ```dispose()```, which is probably bad if you need to pause it often.\r\n\r\nThe callback only get a ```vscode.Uri``` parameter, so if I'm only interested in monitoring when a directory is created or deleted, then for create events, I have to make a ```fs.stat(e.fsPath).isDirectory()``` call and for deletes, I have to keep a list of existing directories, so I can lookup if it is directory. If I'm only interested in changed files, then I have a similar problem.\r\n\r\nI think a better interface would be to have just one callback that get the type of change (create, change, rename, delete), the type of object changed (file, directory) and the Uri.\r\n\r\nI know that detecting renames is hard, especially in a way that works cross platform, but it could be really useful and I think that is actually a good reason for why it should be in the VS Code core, so extension developers have to worry less about cross platform issues - not everybody have access to all platforms.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26851","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26851/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26851/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26851/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26851","id":229557703,"number":26851,"title":"FileSystemWatcher
