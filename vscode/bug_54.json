VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.17.0-insider (128a4e3640c5375f7b0bc1cfd37f626481b1386f, 2017-09-12T05:10:59.101Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.7.0\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create folder structure something like this\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1032549/30316673-a096fe9c-97c5-11e7-95db-b789584a5c8f.png)\r\n  - Command to quickly create the above files & folders\r\n`mkdir -p node_modules1/bundle/lib/model/modules/ot1 && touch node_modules1/bundle/lib/model/modules/ot1/index.js`\r\n`mkdir -p node_modules1/bundle/lib/model/modules/un1 && touch node_modules1/bundle/lib/model/modules/un1/index.js`\r\n`mkdir -p node_modules1/bundle/lib/model/modules/modu1 && touch node_modules1/bundle/lib/model/modules/modu1/index.js`\r\n`mkdir -p node_modules1/bundle/lib/model/modules/oddl1 && touch node_modules1/bundle/lib/model/modules/oddl1/index.js`\r\n\r\n2. Now go to `Go to File... (⌘T)`\r\n3. Type `modu1/index.js` - this is the result\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1032549/30316807-fb9b4d0c-97c5-11e7-9337-33eaf3bad44e.png)\r\n  * expected file is at 2nd\r\n\r\n4. Type `un1/index.js` - this is the result\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1032549/30316838-17f57568-97c6-11e7-8427-5c558bb4430a.png)\r\n  * expected file is at last\r\n\r\nHere result eventually shows up but i expected it as the first result because all the results have common prefix and last result is the best match. This is just the sample but its a big problem where you have large number of files with same name under long path (like me). Sometimes the result is at 30-40 which makes me unable to use vscode for my case. \r\n\r\nThis thing works absolutely fine in sublime text so you can see the expected result and compare.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions:

On VSCode launch, snippets don't show up for ~30 seconds\r\n\r\n![no-snippets-why](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79215/30311752-9f9c2c58-974b-11e7-9c17-c5036511feb0.gif)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Create a snippet like the above\r\n2. Open VSCode with a session with a Javascript file already open\r\n3. Attempt to type the snippet\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe snippet loads and is usable\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nThe snippet doesn't load\r\n\r\n## 2. Snippets randomly don't load at all (neither does any autocomplete)\r\n\r\n![flakey-snippets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79215/30311121-ac4b3bc2-9748-11e7-8f03-473867cb4f6f.gif)\r\n\r\nNotice how I type `log` above the snippet line, and no snippets work. Even if autocompletion doesn't work here (not sure why?) snippets should load, since there's no overhead to loading the contents of a file.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Insert the contents of a snippet\r\n2. Move the cursor above or below and type text that should trigger another snippet\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe snippet loads and autocompletes\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nNothing happens\r\n\r\n## 3. Snippets randomly move in priority, autocomplete nonsense\r\n\r\n![flakey-snippets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79215/30311121-ac4b3bc2-9748-11e7-8f03-473867cb4f6f.gif)\r\n\r\nWhen the autocomplete dropdown for `log` finally shows up, the first entry is **not** a snippet. Instead it's a baffling `var log: Log`. Note I have no variable named `log` anywhere in this file nor my project.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Insert the prefix of a snippet\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe snippet is suggested to autocomplete\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nNonexistent variables are suggested to autocomplete\r\n\r\n## 4. Snippets don't have priority in autocomplete\r\n\r\nI tried naming a snippet with the prefix `\"c\"`. I've done this in all other editors that support snippets. I have it set to expand to the snippet posted at the top of this ticket. However, when I type `c`, a dozen variables that don't exist in my project come up first, as well as things that are syntactically impossible here, like `catch`.\r\n\r\n![complete-not-good](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79215/30311468-311bf2d2-974a-11e7-9105-8d167f0396dc.gif)\r\n\r\n## 5. Snippets don't seem to live reload\r\n\r\nI've used a few Vim snippet plugins, and they seem to reload instantly on saving the file. With VSCode, changing a snippet prefix in `javascript.json`, opening a `.js` file, and typing that prefix does nothing. On restart the snippet shows up.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSo far snippets in VSCode have been a mildly frustrating experience. Even Vim, which has notoriously bad autocomplete, doesn't seem to have these issues.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34197","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34197/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34197/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34197/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34197","id":256931847,"number":34197,"title":"Window failure","user":{"login":"annder","id":12369444,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12369444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/annder","html_url":"https://github.com/annder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/annder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/annder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/annder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/annder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/annder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/annder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/annder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/annder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/annder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2017-09-12T06:30:41Z","updated_at":"2017-09-16T00:51:08Z","closed_at":"2017-09-16T00:51:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
