@StephenBloomquist on April 6, 2017 19:58_\n\nThis is with VSCode version 1.11.1\r\n\r\nIn trying to move my debugger to version 1.18 of the protocol and adapter, but the exception UI (the red bar that spans the screen with exception details) no longer displays. My usage of stopped event hadn't changed between versions, and everything else about the exception behaves as expected.\r\n\r\nI get these errors when I try resizing the debug side bar, which seem like they're relevant due to the exception widget calls in the stack trace:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24838721/24772953/12c23dea-1ac8-11e7-8112-c53202611939.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n_Copied from original issue:
