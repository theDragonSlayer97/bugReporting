to issues: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7830 and https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6190. I have put most of my notes and discussion in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7830.\n\nTo effect the changes, there are basically four parts: \n1. The git server-side CLI commands and state.\n2. The git client-server pipeline to expose the new behavior/state.  \n3. The git changes view which contains the input box.\n4. The git undo last commit action.\n## 1. The git server-side CLI commands and state.\n\nThe two git CLI commands we need to run for these changes include `git config --get commit.template` and `git log -1 --format=%B`. The first reads the `commit.template` entry if it exists, and the second gets the previous commit message. This is very simple, but the distributed architecture makes the implementation of this somewhat extensive. \n\nSince the commit.template command is a read on the config, this was most easily executed by using the repo's existing run command: `repo.run(['config', '--get', 'commit.template'])`. I could have also done this with the log I suppose, but it seemed a good fit for its own method on the `Repository` class.\n\nAlso, there is a design decision on how to capture the state involved in these operations. This stems from the existing design requiring a status on each git operation execution. I chose to combine the information in an `ICommitInfo` to keep it cleaner for our use case. I then added this to the `IModel` because, AFAICT, this is how state is passed in these operations. \n\nIt essentially works like the following: Operation -> Status -> Model. \n\nWhen an operation is executed, whatever it is, it then executes an updated status, which creates an updated model that is expected on the client/browser.\n## 2. The git client-server pipeline to expose the new behavior/state.\n\nThere are several abstraction layers when communicating between the client/server with this being an electron application. I had a design decision on how to access the above behavior/state:\n1. Add a git operation method.\n2. Alter some existing operation.\n\nI went with 1 and added a `getCommitInfo` method along client-server communication pipeline, because it didn't seem to fit anywhere in the existing code. After completion, it's conceivable that it could fit in the `RawGitService.status` method. Actually, I think that this is probably where it _should_ be, but I wanted to go ahead and start this PR. If I change it to this, then I don't think I will need to change any of the existing client-server channel code, and it would simplify a great deal. But, on the other hand, it's working now as-is (except it does not work with a _global_ commit.template file specified as `~/.somefile`. It can handle this format for a local commit template in the repo's .git folder). \n## 3. The git changes view which contains the input box. AND 4. The git undo last commit action.\n\nThis is pretty straight-forward on the `ChangesView`. I've added a `onCommitInputShown` method and hooked this in the `setVisible` method. The only real nuance to this is understanding the workflow of the `UndoLastCommitAction` implementation. \n\nBecause of the distributed design of the actions, there must be a way of sharing state between the action and the `ChangesView.commitInputBox`. It had to get the previous commit info **before** executing the undo/reset action, and we need a way to get this previous message into the input box when it is shown. So I simply store the previous commit message in local storage (without an explicit scope) using the `IStorageService` when running the `UndoLastCommitAction`. Then, the first time that the `onCommitInputShown` is called, it always checks this first. If it exists, then it immediately sets its value to that and removes it from local storage.\n\nOther than this nuance, it should be obvious from the code how this works.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8933/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8932","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8932/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8932/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8932/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8932","id":164517135,"number":8932,"title":"VSCode is breaking my Vim...","user":{"login":"chief10","id":2761499,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2761499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chief10","html_url":"https://github.com/chief10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chief10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chief10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chief10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chief10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chief10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chief10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chief10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chief10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chief10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":386618042,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-07-08T12:04:48Z","updated_at":"2016-07-11T07:51:26Z","closed_at":"2016-07-11T07:51:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"...addiction.\n\nJust wanted to say that I take issue with how well you guys are doing with putting this editor together.

VSCode Version: 1.3.0\n- OS Version: Win 10 - 1511\n\n**Extensions view needs custom width for side bar.**\n\nI keep my side bar neat and narrow which works fine for the normal explorer view.\nBut when browsing the new extensions view the narrow size of the side bar is clearly too small to read anything useful. Either make the width for the extensions view automatically wider or change what is shown in the side bar to the names of extensions only and keep any buttons to uninstall or install etc to the detail view on the right.\n\n![vscodeext](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/361077/16683502/24405094-44f8-11e6-8c66-35d0d517c0eb.PNG)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8921","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8921/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8921/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8921/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8921","id":164492481,"number":8921,"title":"Install Extension does not work","user":{"login":"DasJott","id":6298761,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6298761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasJott","html_url":"https://github.com/DasJott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasJott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasJott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasJott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasJott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasJott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasJott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasJott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasJott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DasJott/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-07-08T09:27:44Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T09:44:03Z","closed_at":"2016-07-08T09:44:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.3.0 (e724f269ded347b49fcf1657fc576399354e6703, 2016-07-07T16:50:12.291Z)\n- OS Version: Linux x64 4.4.0-28-generic (Ubuntu 16.04)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
