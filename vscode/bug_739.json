The code file and test file both have nearly identical names (the test file typically having `.spec` in the file name), and so are conveniently listed at the top of the list when I enter characters into the fuzzy filter.

VSCode Version: 1.7.0-Insiders\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nIt appears this started to happen on 10/6/2016. I have had some odd behavior occur to some of my extensions, and it appears at least one was corrupt in the process. Old versions of extensions are some how partially getting installed or having something odd go on with them. Here is an example of an extension.\n- New Version: EditorConfig.EditorConfig-0.3.3 - Folder Modified 10/6/2016 at 3:00 PM (File Contents all say last modified 9/29/2016 2:32 PM)\n- Old Version: EditorConfig.EditorConfig-0.3.1 - Folder Modified 10/6/2016 at 3:05 PM\n\nThis Extension is broken and you get errors about `EditorConfig.EditorConfig-0.3.1\\package.json` failing to be read and `EditorConfig.EditorConfig-0.3.3/out/src/editorConfigMain` unable to be activated because it is missing. What is odd about this, is the directory `EditorConfig.EditorConfig-0.3.3` shows modified 10/6/2016 at 3:05 PM, but the contents show 9/29/2016 at 2:32 PM, which makes sense to me since the extension was update 9/24. So it appears that the extension was some how broken after it was already installed. It is missing the `out` directory, but if I look in `EditorConfig.EditorConfig-0.3.1` it only has `Node_Modules` and `out`  directories.\n\nThis is the only module that appears to have fully broken, but I have about 8 total that error that have files dated 10/6/2016 at 3:05 PM. The old version directories only have a couple directories left in them, like `Node_Modules` and `out` or `Node_Modules` and `dist` or `file-types` and `lib` etc, so Code errors when it can't find the `package.json`\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.  \"extensions.autoUpdate\": true\n2.  \"window.reopenFolders\": \"all\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13602","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13602/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13602/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13602/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13602","id":182543699,"number":13602,"title":"Incorrect highlighting for markdown block quote code blocks","user":{"login":"calebmer","id":8282507,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8282507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebmer","html_url":"https://github.com/calebmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calebmer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"kieferrm","id":4674940,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4674940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm","html_url":"https://github.com/kieferrm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kieferrm","id":4674940,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4674940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm","html_url":"https://github.com/kieferrm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-10-12T14:40:16Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T22:44:54Z","closed_at":"2016-10-13T22:44:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.6.0\n- OS Version: MacOS Sierra\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

I can't pinpoint exactly when the issue started occurring, but it was prior to the latest build - possibly from 1.5.\n\nOur build is pretty complex and highly modular, so it would prove difficult to list it all out here.  I don't think it's particularly relevant at this stage, but I know it could prove useful.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open VS code and run the Grunt build without making any changes, it completes successfully. \n2. Make a change to a module, for example a scss partial. \n3. Re-run the build and encounter one of the following errors:\n\n```\nRunning \"requirejs:hub2\" (requirejs) task                                                                                                                  \n{ [Error: Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, stat 'C:\\development\\projects\\wdp-versionable\\cluster\\external\\hub2\\scripts\\facades']                     \n  originalError:                                                                                                                                           \n   { [Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, stat 'C:\\development\\projects\\wdp-versionable\\cluster\\external\\hub2\\scripts\\facades']                         \n     errno: -4048,                                                                                                                                         \n     code: 'EPERM',                                                                                                                                        \n     syscall: 'stat',                                                                                                                                      \n     path: 'C:\\\\development\\\\projects\\\\wdp-versionable\\\\cluster\\\\external\\\\hub2\\\\scripts\\\\facades' } } \n```\n\n**OR**\n\n```\nRunning \"requirejs:hub2\" (requirejs) task                                                                                                                  \n{ [Error: Error: ENOTEMPTY: directory not empty, rmdir 'C:\\development\\projects\\wdp-versionable\\cluster\\external\\hub2\\scripts']                            \n  originalError:                                                                                                                                           \n   { [Error: ENOTEMPTY: directory not empty, rmdir 'C:\\development\\projects\\wdp-versionable\\cluster\\external\\hub2\\scripts']                                \n     errno: -4051,                                                                                                                                         \n     code: 'ENOTEMPTY',                                                                                                                                    \n     syscall: 'rmdir',                                                                                                                                     \n     path: 'C:\\\\development\\\\projects\\\\wdp-versionable\\\\cluster\\\\external\\\\hub2\\\\scripts' } }\n```\n\n![integrated-terminal-error](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5471026/19306529/0858be86-906e-11e6-8711-e29a9f600baf.PNG)\n1. Attempting to run the build outside of VS Code, in Git Bash also then leads to one of the same errors being thrown.\n2. Tried killing the terminal session in VS Code, opening up a new one and running the build again.  This leads to same error.\n3. Close VS Code and run the build externally in Git Bash - Build **completes successfully**\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13588","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13588/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13588/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13588/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13588","id":182489469,"number":13588,"title":"Does not work vscode-icons!","user":{"login":"DumanBi","id":6670988,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6670988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DumanBi","html_url":"https://github.com/DumanBi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DumanBi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DumanBi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DumanBi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DumanBi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DumanBi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DumanBi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DumanBi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DumanBi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DumanBi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":421131022,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/as-designed","name":"as-designed","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-10-12T10:24:44Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T07:42:09Z","closed_at":"2016-10-12T10:48:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.6.0 (e52fb0bc87e6f5c8f144e172639891d8d8c9aa55, 2016-10-10T18:37:40.189Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 6.1.7601\n- Extensions: abusaidm.html-snippets-0.0.16, dbaeumer.vscode-eslint-1.0.7, gerane.Theme-Monokai-0.0.2, HookyQR.beautify-0.4.0, mohsen1.prettify-json-0.0.3, ms-vscode.PowerShell-0.7.2, msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome-1.1.0, robertohuertasm.vscode-icons-3.0.3, vsmobile.vscode-react-native-0.2.0, waderyan.gitblame-1.3.0, xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets-1.2.0\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
