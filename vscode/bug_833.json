Open a text document in vscode with a fair amount of text. \n2. Launch the Find/Replace dialogue \"Command + F\" \n3. Click the regex icon to enter a regex pattern for the find and replace forms. \n4. Observe there is no means from that dialogue to save the regex pattern or reference previously used regex patterns. \n\nExpected Behavior: \n1. The Find/Replace dialogue would provide a means of saving regex patterns used for future use. Please see attached screen shots of the method BBEdit uses to accomplish this as an example of this feature.

You see in the sidebar little symbols indicating additions removals and changes (handy!). You can't remember _what_ this particular change was though.\n#### IntelliJ solution\n\nClick the gutter symbol, see the old version of these few lines _immediately in context_. Ohh yeah that was just something you were fooling around with for debugging but it's not needed any more, click to rollback this single change.\n#### VSCode solution\n\nChange entirely to another view in the editor to see a full file-by-file diff of the two files (_Git: Open Change_). Unless I'm mistaken, manually change the file to undo the change (I looked for _Git: {Revert,Undo,Rollback} this {change,diff,patch}_) but came up empty).\n### Big picture\n\nVSCode's inbuilt git UI is great for rolling back changes at the file level (`git checkout`), but weak at changes at the patch level (`git checkout -p`). This IntelliJ paradigm is the best GUI I have seen for handling this common operation.\n\nI would love to contribute this feature to VSCode, whether though an extension or an addition to the core product. I would personally lobby for an inclusion in the core, as it complements and completes in my mind the existing git checkout/add features that do not require extensions. I also believe it is not presently possible to customise the gutter in extensions (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9561).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10782/reactions","total_count":75,"+1":69,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":6}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10781","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10781/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10781/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10781/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10781","id":172399605,"number":10781,"title":"After debug (of extension) file is not editable","user":{"login":"whitecolor","id":736697,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/736697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecolor","html_url":"https://github.com/whitecolor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecolor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecolor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecolor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecolor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecolor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecolor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecolor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecolor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecolor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-08-22T08:53:21Z","updated_at":"2016-08-23T12:33:47Z","closed_at":"2016-08-23T12:33:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: insiders\n- OS Version: windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nI start debugging extension.
