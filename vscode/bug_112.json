was curious what happened to the reporter of #32405 so I did some tests, and while he might have some self-inflicted problem being taken serious, I also think there's more to it.\r\n\r\nThis is vscode 1.14.2 on Linux x86_64.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n    mkdir vs-code-vc-test\r\n    cd vs-code-vc-test\r\n    ls >test-1.txt\r\n    ls >test-2.txt\r\n\r\n2. In vscode: \"File\" -> \"Open Folder\" -> Open the directory just created\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/240625/29263990-91b97c5c-80db-11e7-9996-47b6c0ede5be.png)\r\n\r\n3. On the \"Source Control\" Tab: Click \"Initialize Repository\" (but, see below)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/240625/29264076-ec012e6c-80db-11e7-8b4f-1974a6fab400.png)\r\n\r\nThis is displayed like this in vscode\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/240625/29264103-09e764fa-80dc-11e7-8b49-794db9df9ffd.png)\r\n\r\nand the state of the repository is reported by `git status` like this, as expected\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/240625/29264209-674523bc-80dc-11e7-8cf9-9dbf5d9add80.png)\r\n\r\n4. Stage file test-1.txt and commit it\r\n\r\n5. Make some random change to the content of file test-1.txt\r\n\r\nThis is shown like this in vscode\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/240625/29265006-a061d336-80df-11e7-8814-62ec38123b19.png)\r\n\r\nand reported like this by `git status`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/240625/29265032-b9cd0426-80df-11e7-9a12-cdeb32286091.png)\r\n\r\n6. Select \"Discard All Changes\" from the overflow menu (three dots in in the upper right corner) of the \"Source Control\" Tab and confirm the warning dialog that appears:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/240625/29264474-8558b476-80dd-11e7-9383-1f847027dddb.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/240625/29264526-c8a1b354-80dd-11e7-82d7-76e7b0066998.png)\r\n\r\n7. Result: test-1.txt is reset to the version that was committed (as expected), and **test-2.txt is deleted although it was never added to git**!\r\n\r\nThere are multiple things that I consider problematic:\r\n\r\n1. Given the two menu entries \"Unstage all changes\" and \"Discard all changes\" I would have expected \"Unstage ...\" to do the equivalent of `git reset --mixed` (what it seems to do) and \"Discard ...\" to just do the equivalent of `git reset --hard`, but the latter really also does a `git clean` which **removes all untracked files** from the working tree! That's such a dangerous command that I argue there shouldn't even be an UI entry for it. \r\n2. There doesn't seem to be a equivalent to just `git reset --hard` in the menu, which I would consider\r\n(more) useful and might give a hint that \"Discard changes\" is really even more dangerous. The thing \r\nabout the warning is: If I want to do a `git reset --hard` I **expect** a warning (and would therefore confirm it) because it **is** dangerous.\r\n3. Even if that's really how \"Discard changes\" is supposed to work, then the warning should not just read \r\n\"Are you sure you want to discard ALL changes?\" (is an untracked file really a \"change\"?) but clearly state the fact that untracked files will be removed and maybe name (some of) them.\r\n4. Minor nitpick: I think the safer option of the two (\"Unstage...\") should come first in the menu.\r\n\r\nWhat **might** make things worse (and the scenario from #32405 more plausible) is that I **think** that during my tests vscode twice initialized a git repository in the current directory on its own, that is, without me clicking \"Initialize Repository\" or running \"git init\" on the command line. I haven't really been able to reproduce that, though, so it might be just me being confused. It just mention it in case someone also encountered that before or comes up with a scenario where this might happen.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: Code 1.14.2 (cb82febafda0c8c199b9201ad274e25d9a76874e, 2017-07-19T23:26:08.116Z)\r\n- OS Version: Linux x64 4.12.4-1-ARCH\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\nExtension|Author (truncated)|Version\r\n---|---|---\r\nEditorConfig|Edi|0.9.4\r\nvscode-eslint|dba|1.2.11\r\npython|don|0.7.0\r\njson-tools|eri|1.0.2\r\nGo|luk|0.6.63\r\ncpptools|ms-|0.12.2\r\npolymer-ide|pol|0.6.0\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32459/reactions","total_count":52,"+1":47,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32458","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32458/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32458/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32458/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32458","id":249978338,"number":32458,"title":"Point line for all type format files","user":{"login":"miladghiravani","id":5067331,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5067331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani","html_url":"https://github.com/miladghiravani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miladghiravani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-08-14T09:32:11Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T22:02:15Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.15.0 (8b95971d8cccd3afd86b35d4a0e098c189294ff2, 2017-08-09T20:16:06.988Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 6.3.9600\r\n----\r\nHi, Please add point line for all type format files.
