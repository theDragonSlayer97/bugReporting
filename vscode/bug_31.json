I think it will be fantastically useful if when you select a range of text, the first opening parens/bracket in the range, and its corresponding closing parens/bracket, would be highlighted the same way that it's highlighted when you put the cursor next to parens.\r\n\r\nThe reason why it would be useful is that when you select a piece of code, especially if it is large, it's often hard to tell where you should end the selection, and usually that's where the closing parens/bracket is.\r\n\r\nAs as extra plus, this feature would be easily discoverable by users without needing to be told about it.\r\n\r\nFor selections with multiple ranges this can be disabled or applied to the first range - whichever is easier to

regarding the Code Editor Font Size not attached the ctrl+mouse wheel like every text/code editor out there. There's a reason the change font size is attached to the mouse wheel. people use it, especially if like me they are half blind, we use it hundreds of times an hour\r\n\r\nYou absolutely need the ability to change the font size on the fly in the code editor window because this is how blind people code:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGUhLW4pbs\r\n\r\nIt's not the first time I notice this omission in a code a editor, I already made that video for another Code editor whose developer also made the same bad judgement call. It's understandable if you are not visually impaired but this needs addressing.\r\n\r\nI know you can change the UI font with ctrl - or + but that is NOT what I'm asking. for one it changes the wrong thing and for 2 it breaks the fluidity of the perusing. \r\n\r\nLike in Code, here, the people I made the video for also thought ctlr - or + to change the UI size was what was people needed... it's not. We need both UI AND Code size change to support people with poor eyesight. \r\n\r\nAnd I'm NOT asking to tie the mouse wheel to the UI font Size!!! It needs to be tied to the Code Box ONLY!\r\n\r\nI dont want to zoom in my code and the whole UI explodes leaving me with no room to work with,\r\n\r\nctrl - or + to change the UI zoom\r\nctrl mouse wheel to change the codebox zoom\r\nthe code box font size is determined by the code box font settings * the codebox zoom * the UI zoom\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you guys fix it.... And remember, I would not be posting suggestions or pointing out omissions if I did not care. I'm starting to like this product a whole lot tbh, but these little annoyances take their toll and end up being major hurdles over long periods of time, they need to be fixed.
