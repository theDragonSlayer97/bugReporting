Settings:\r\n```\r\n    \"editor.wordWrap\": \"on\",\r\n    \"css.colorDecorators.enable\": true\r\n```\r\n2. Code example:\r\n```\r\n   .form-control:focus { border-color: #141d36; box-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.075) inset, 0 0 4px rgba(165,128,57,0.6); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.075) inset, 0 0 4px rgba(165,128,57,0.6); }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith colorDecorators disabled word wrapping works fine. After enabling it wordWrap completely ignores the width of added decorators and wrapes the code as they are not there what makes parts of the code to be pushed out of viewport.\r\n\r\nI think it would be better to just underline the colors accordingly instead adding new elements next to it.\r\nAlso it would be great to add some margin between wrapped code and minimap (or whatever is on the right).\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions:

like to implement a \"Loaded Scripts Explorer\" for the Firefox debug adapter but realized that I can only open the files shown in that explorer if they are \"local\", but not if they'd need to be fetched from Firefox via the debug adapter (e.g. third-party libraries loaded from a CDN, scripts injected by a Browser extension, etc.). However, the ability to view such \"remote\" files is one of the primary use cases for this explorer (IMHO).\r\n\r\nIt is already possible to view a \"remote\" file if it is referenced by a stackframe - in this case it is fetched via the debug adapter using its numeric source reference. But I can't do that in my explorer for two reasons:\r\n* I can't tell VS Code about source files and their associated source references (unless they show up in a stackframe)\r\n* I can't ask VS Code to open a file using its source reference\r\n\r\nI was thinking about implementing a document provider to work around these limitations but that would only be a partial solution: VS Code wouldn't know about the relationship between the files from that content provider and the debugger, so it wouldn't be possible to set breakpoints and if the user stepped into that file later on, VS Code would open a second tab for the file (because it is fetched from the debug content provider and hence is a different file from VS Code's point of view).\r\n\r\nMy proposal would be:\r\n1. add a `NewSourceEvent` (containing a `Source` object in its body) to the debug protocol\r\n2. add the ability to open a file using a `debugSessionId` and a `sourceReference`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32844","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32844/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32844/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32844/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32844","id":251477603,"number":32844,"title":"Markdown
