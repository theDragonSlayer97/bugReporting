used two npm modules related to Markdown: \"markdown-it\" and a its plug-in module [markdown-it-named-headers](https://github.com/leff/markdown-it-named-headers).\r\n\r\nNot only the plug-in module is not enabled (under VSCode, `id` attributes are not at all generated for HTML produced from Markdown), but, when enabled, it fails to maintain uniqueness of `id` values.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nIn markdown document, write:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Some Heading\r\n\r\n# Some Heading\r\n```\r\nOn HTML output, it produces two HTML elements `<h1 id=\"some-heading\"`, which means invalid HTML.\r\n\r\n### The reason\r\n\r\nIn \"index.js\" of the set of the used `id` values, `used_headers`, is initialized to empty on each heading (the handler of the rule `md.renderer.rules.heading_open`), effectively turning uniqueness control off.\r\n\r\n### Suggestion\r\n\r\nI'm not proposing to fix the bug: it would make little sense. I reported the bug in the modules' repository and fixed it in my derived plug-in, not published as npm module, but embedded in my [VSCode extension \"Extensible Markdown Converter\"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sakryukov.convert-markdown-to-html), see \"out/id.toc.js\" in [source code](https://github.com/SAKryukov/vscode-markdown-to-html).\r\n\r\nInstead, I propose a different thing: there must be one unified markdown plug-in for generation of `id` attributes for headers and TOC (and, possibly, some other features referencing HTML elements by `id`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30812","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30812/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30812/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30812/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30812","id":243250344,"number":30812,"title":"intellisense

Now If I need to create another nested HTML element inside this, cursor should indent automatically, on the new line. Instead, if you hit enter inside the `div` tags, what you'll get is - \r\n```\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nSo then you'll need to go to `</div>`, hit enter, and indent manually.\r\n\r\nHere is my [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45115915/how-to-auto-indent-nested-html-tags-in-vs-code) on stack overflow, which explains this. It also has a GIF showing how it auto indents in Webstorm.\r\n\r\nIs there an extension/setting in VS Code that does this? I've tried `editor.formatOnType` but it won't work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an HTML file. Create `<div class=\"container\"></div>`.\r\n2.
