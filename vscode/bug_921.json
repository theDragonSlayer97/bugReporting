need two build tasks for the configurations above but the\n\"options\" -> \"cwd\" property can only set once global. So the problem \nis here that the cwd should set in the specified build tasks like this.\n\n`\"tasks\": [\n   {\n      \"taskName\" : \"buildApp1\",\n     \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}/src/WebApp1\",\n

seems that the left hand side of a diff editor is now suddenly editable with the new search & replace preview feature. The workbench is not really fit for allowing other editors (non-file, non-file-diff) to be editable nor do I believe is it discoverable or expected to be able to type on the left hand side. You will quickly notice that typing in the left hand side suddenly opens the file (as a tab in the background) and you also do not get any dirty indicators in the title area of the editor.\n\nIf we want the diff to be editable I suggest to do what we do when you compare 2 files or open a git change: The right hand side is editable because the right hand side is an instance of `FileEditorInput`.\n\nOtherwise, please disable editing to the left until we have a story from the workbench to make this

VSCode Version: 1.3.0-insider (commit de66522, 2016-06-24)\n- OS Version: Win10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Use 'code-insiders .' to open a repo.\n2. Click an md file to open it.  Type some text into the file.\n3. Click another md file.  It opens in a new tab.\n4. CTRL+SHIFT+V to preview the second file.\n5. Three tabs are now open, two raw md and the one with a preview of the second md.\n6. Now click tab 1.\n7. Now click tab 3.\n8. CTRL+SHIFT+V.\n\nExpected: we go back to tab 2, because that is the raw md for the file previewed in tab 3.\nActual: we go back to tab 1, which is raw md for a completely different file.\n@gregvanl
