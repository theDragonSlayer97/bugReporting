I'm using the Native Debug extension to debug my executable, but need to run my `build` task before to ensure that I always have the most recent version of my code built. This ends up in a kind of unfriendly behavior for me because the window always switches to \"Terminal\" when running the build task but does not switch back to \"Debug Console\" afterwards. I think it makes a lot of sense to either switch to the Debug Console if I was on there before when the `preLaunchTask` finished with exit status 0 or do not switch to the Terminal at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Configure a Build Task\r\n2. Configure a Debug Task with `preLaunchTask` set to the Build Task\r\n3. Switch to the \"Debug Console\"\r\n4. Start Debugging (F5)\r\n5. notice how the window goes to \"Terminal\" but does not switch back to Debug Console.\r\n\r\n*Demonstration*: [Screen Recording (1.06MB)](https://in.fkn.space/i/2017-08-14_16-03-36-9a7ac213.mp4)\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: No (no debugger available for me)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32476","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32476/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32476/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32476/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/32476","id":250039949,"number":32476,"title":"Correct progress type for PPromise.join","user":{"login":"keegancsmith","id":187831,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/187831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keegancsmith","html_url":"https://github.com/keegancsmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keegancsmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keegancsmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keegancsmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keegancsmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keegancsmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keegancsmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keegancsmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keegancsmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keegancsmith/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-08-14T14:01:32Z","updated_at":"2017-08-18T18:57:13Z","closed_at":"2017-08-18T18:57:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/pulls/32476","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/32476","diff_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/32476.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/32476.patch"},"body":"`PPromise.join` does not forward the progress events.
