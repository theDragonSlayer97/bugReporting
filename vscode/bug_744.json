VSCode Version: 1.6.0\n- OS Version: Mac 10.11.6\n\nAs of 1.6 there has been a problem with an extension I am working on where it is not properly reloading the preview pane on content update or when multiple previews are open.\n\nSpecifically the first time the provideTextDocumentContent is called, the content that is returned is correctly shown (the string is a simple html page with an embedded script that redirects the page to a local webserver via window.location.href) and the page redirects correctly. \n\nWhen the onDidChange emitter is fired and the provideTextDocumentContent is called again, it used to be that the preview pane when once again update with the redirect html and everything worked fine. However, in 1.6 nothing happens once the provideTextDocumentContent is called and the preview pane does not update.\n\nAdditionally, when a new document is created with the same TextDocumentContentProvider, the provideTextDocumentContent is called, but it seems as though the preview pane uses the same exact same webview as the first document (not just a copy) because there is no visual reload when switching between the two documents, and everything that happens in one (scrolling, etc) happens to the other. Additionally, the redirect never seems to fire, as the local webserver that would catch the redirect never receives a request (it does on the very first document).\n\nThis seems like odd behavior and I've tried looking up the call stack from provideTextDocumentContent to see if I can figure out the problem, however, I haven't been able to track anything down through the promise chain. Let me know if you need any other information.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13453","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13453/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13453/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13453/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13453","id":182138610,"number":13453,"title":"C# error detection does not work at all in 1.6","user":{"login":"rudolfdobias","id":2642842,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2642842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudolfdobias","html_url":"https://github.com/rudolfdobias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudolfdobias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudolfdobias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudolfdobias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudolfdobias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudolfdobias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudolfdobias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudolfdobias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudolfdobias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudolfdobias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-10-10T23:26:16Z","updated_at":"2016-10-28T15:10:06Z","closed_at":"2016-10-28T15:09:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.6\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

Is there are way to manage which extension has priority, so that it can receive and process the keystrokes? \nIdeally I want to Jumpy to receive and process the next two keystrokes after enabling `Jumpy Word Mode`, but then let the rest of the keystrokes forward to `VSCodeVim`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13441/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13440","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13440/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13440/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13440/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13440","id":182085507,"number":13440,"title":"Test: Add commands to scroll to top and bottom of terminal","user":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/29","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/29","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/29/labels","id":2019000,"number":29,"title":"October 2016","description":"","creator":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":448,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-09-21T11:16:13Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T08:17:55Z","due_on":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-11-02T19:54:13Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-10-10T18:44:13Z","updated_at":"2016-10-25T17:18:21Z","closed_at":"2016-10-25T17:18:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Test for #11135\n- [x] Windows @alexandrudima\n- [x] Linux @aeschli \n- [x] Mac @joaomoreno \n\nTest the following commands, their keybindings are supposed to match the default terminal on the platform:\n\n`workbench.action.terminal.scrollToBottom`\n- Windows: <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>end</kbd>\n- Linux: <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>end</kbd>\n- Mac: <kbd>end</kbd>\n\n`workbench.action.terminal.scrollToTop`\n- Windows: <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>home</kbd>\n- Linux: <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>home</kbd>\n- Mac: <kbd>home</kbd>\n\n**Important**: Remember if you have set `terminal.integrated.commandsToSkipShell` in your `settings.json` the key strokes will be consumed by the terminal and not passed to the vscode keybinding handler.
