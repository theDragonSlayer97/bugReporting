VSCode Version: All versions\r\n- OS Version: All versions\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Hover over an actionable item, and notice how your cursor changes to a Hand.\r\n\r\nAlso notice how in nearly all desktop software, you do not get this behavior. Instead, the actionable item slightly changes to indicate that the user is hovering over it. But in VS Code, this is not the case. The cursor is changed to convey this. Changing to a hand cursor leaves a very web-ish and uncomfortable feeling, and even though this is technically based on web technologies, it is still a \"desktop app\", and I believe that the behavior should be consistent with the rest of the system and its software.\r\n\r\nI have already \"fixed\" this in my fork and would like to push a PR.
