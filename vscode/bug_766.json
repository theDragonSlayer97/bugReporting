Fails for `rxvt-unicode` and `terminator`.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nOne: Create an empty project. `npm i express`. Make `app.js` like this:\n\n``` js\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\nvar process = require('process');\n\nconsole.log(process.cwd());\nconsole.log(process.argv);\n\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\n  res.send('Hello World!');\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');\n});\n```\n\nTwo: \nMy launch.json\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Launch\",\n            \"type\": \"node\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/app.js\",\n            \"stopOnEntry\": false,\n            \"args\": [\"test\"],\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}/node_modules\",\n            \"preLaunchTask\": null,\n            \"runtimeExecutable\": null,\n            \"runtimeArgs\": [\n                \"--nolazy\"\n            ],\n            \"env\": {\n                \"NODE_ENV\": \"development\"\n            },\n            \"console\": \"externalTerminal\",\n            \"sourceMaps\": false,\n            \"outFiles\": []\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWorkspace setting:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"terminal.external.linuxExec\": \"rxvt-unicode\"\n}\n```\n## rxvt-unicode\n\nLaunches external terminal. Outputs `Debugger listening on [::]:43160`, but after few seconds VSCode show error saying \"Cannot launch debug target in terminal (timeout)\".\n## terminator\n\nLaunches external terminal. Almost look like cd'ed into `cwd`, because it shows `octref@ubuntu:~/Downloads/test/node_modules`, the `cwd` I specified in the launch config.\n\nSame error \"Cannot launch debug target in terminal (timeout)\" is shown after a few seconds.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12790","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12790/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12790/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12790/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12790","id":179555025,"number":12790,"title":"'Run in external terminal' does not reuse alternate terminal","user":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":256129996,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"fef2c0","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-27T17:10:02Z","updated_at":"2016-11-14T11:25:39Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.6.0-insider (f62883f07422cae4b53c2a185b105091460a0a85, 2016-09-27T12:46:15.113Z)\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 15.6.0\n\nTesting #12252\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

migrating our code from version: 0.1.0(6c0fe2014e7a7d596ac1af21f25bf2fc17da8a75) to the latest Monaco editor release version: 0.6.1(8f43cf5d0d3d233c9ba1c9085f2bb529f834c841).\n\nDuring the process I encountered a breaking change, hopefully you may help.\n\nWe are using the SuggestController for showing intellisense for a custom language (‘Kusto’).\nIn the suggestion we are using codeSnippets with empty brackets {{}}, for placing the cursor inside the added text. \nFor example, codeSnippet: ‘count({{}})’.\nWhen the suggestion is selected the value ‘count()’ is added to the editor and the cursor is placed between the brackets. \nIn the new release, empty brackets {{}} doesn’t place the cursor in the right position.\n\nAnother thing, after the user selects a suggestion from the list we trigger again the suggestController to show him more suggestions (without him pressing anything). \n\n```\n       // Trigger automatically the intellisense suggestions after the user accepted a suggestion\n       function suggestionAcceptListener() {\n           if (!_editor) return;\n\n           _editor.onDidChangeCursorSelection(function (event) {\n               // Re-trigger the suggestions right after the user selected one of the suggestions\n               var acceptSuggestion = (event.source === 'modelChange' && event.reason === monaco.editor.CursorChangeReason.RecoverFromMarkers);\n               if (!acceptSuggestion) {\n                   return;\n               }\n\n               triggerSuggestions();\n           });\n       };\n\n       function triggerSuggestions() {\n\n           var _suggestController = _editor.getContribution(\"editor.contrib.suggestController\");\n\n           if (!_suggestController) {\n               return;\n           }\n\n           _suggestController.model.cancel();\n           $timeout(function () {\n               _suggestController.model.trigger(true);\n           }, 10);\n       };\n```\n\nI tried to replace the empty brackets with {{ }} (adding a space in between the brackets). The cursor move to the right position, standing on a blue space. The suggestions window is opened again. When the user now selects an item from the suggestions list, we crash. (It seems that the snippetController has been destroyed already, probably since we re-trigger the suggestController).\n\nIs there anything I can do?\nCan you fix it?\n\nThanks!\nAnat\n\nFor playing with the old editor and see what I’m trying to achieve:\n1.  Go to https://analytics.applicationinsights.io/demo\n2.  Open a new query tab (next to the Home Page tab)\n3.  Write in the editor (or copy paste):\ncustomEvents\n| where timestamp >\n4.  Add a space to trigger the suggestController.\n5.  Select ‘ago()’\n6.  See the suggestions window is opened again, while the cursor is inside the brackets.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12785","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12785/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12785/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12785/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12785","id":179533244,"number":12785,"title":"[Razor]
