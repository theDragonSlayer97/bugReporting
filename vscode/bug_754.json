Set `\"editor.tabCompletion\": false` in `settings.json`\n2. Try to type `d-b` in css and press `Tab` for Emmet abbreviation expansion, you'll get something like `-ms-word-break:` instead of `display: block` (surprise!).\n3. You will actually get an autocomplete suggestion from the first item of the suggestions box (unexpected).\n\nExpected:\n- when `\"editor.tabCompletion\" = false` tab shouldn't expand the suggestions\n- when `\"editor.tabCompletion\" = true` tab should expand using the first suggestion\n\nIt's said `\"editor.tabCompletion\"` works better when `\"editor.quickSuggestions\"` is `false`. But if I switch it off, I get no suggestions at all. I need them and I actually use them often when abbreviations aren't suitable.\n\nThis is actually a horrible behavior, since it makes me chill when I try to use Emmet inside the VSCode.\n\nVideo:
