However I see vscode attempting to update breakpoints after code edits even before writing the code to disk, so the debug adapter is working from different code to vscode.\n\nFor a concrete example, consider the nodejs code\n\n```\nsetInterval(function() {\n    console.log(\"1\");\n    console.log(\"2\");\n}, 5000);\n```\n\nIf you set a breakpoint on line 2 with the first console.log line there and run it, the breakpoint is hit before printing the line, as expected. If you then continue execution and insert a newline before that first console.log _without saving the file_, the next iteration will show the breakpoint as being hit on line 3 with the console.log(\"1\") line, but the program output will show that a \"1\" has already been printed and the breakpoint is actually set on line 3 of the original sources.\n\nIt seems to me that vscode should only instruct the debug adapters to update breakpoints after the files have been saved to disk and are visible to other processes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2973","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2973/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2973/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2973/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2973","id":133299307,"number":2973,"title":"Distribute

guys, I love vscode and use it for javascript every day, but the IntelliSense pop-up has caused me a good deal of frustration recently because it always seems to pop up when I'm typing and it prevents me using the up/down arrows until I hit escape. It's probably very useful and I just don't understand how to use it, but I was surprised to learn there is no way to disable it. The user settings make a reference to it but only provide two options and both are disabled by default. Hopefully it's appropriate for me to make a suggestion here to allow users to disable it.\n\n![intellisense
