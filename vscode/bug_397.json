VSCode Version: Latest (1.10.2)\r\n- OS Version: macOS (but any, really)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open up any file lacking an extension\r\n2. Observe how it is not syntax colored without human intervention\r\n\r\n**Problem:** Files without an explicit extension are not syntax colored by default. It is not enough to be able to specify (e.g., in user settings) that all files without an extension are assumed to be of a specific syntax.\r\n\r\n**Desired Result:** A modeline embedded early on in a given file (e.g., the first line, or immediately after the top comment) provides VS Code with a developer-provided hint on how to automatically syntax color a given file, even if it doesn't have a file extension.\r\n\r\nModern C++ header files don't necessarily have file extensions. A common example are STL headers, but I frequently create extension-less C++ headers in my own projects. GitHub lets me work around this issue by reading an editor modeline (e.g., Emacs or Vim) I specify at the top of the file. For a C++ header I can specify the following Emacs modeline in a comment and get C++ syntax coloring: `-*- mode: c++; -*-` (Vim has a similar mechanism, but I opted to go the Emacs route since Vim's is slightly more verbose.)\r\n\r\nVS Code should allow me to do the same thing. Right now, I have to click on the language popup in the status bar and set the language manually. I have to reselect the language periodically, and always between editor invocations, which gets annoying real fast.\r\n\r\nOne question that might arise is what to do if a file with an extension has a modeline specified? If the modeline matches the extension then obviously there would be no need to do anything. If the modeline is different then VS Code could stick with the extension (a sane default) or, if a new config option has been set to `true`, use the modeline's value instead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23872","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23872/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23872/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23872/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23872","id":219056823,"number":23872,"title":"Bug
