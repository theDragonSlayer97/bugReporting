(This was one of my favorite Sublime plugins) \r\n\r\nAlso, creating a folder seems to have another command to have new new file, which might not be needed. For example, the following \"new item\" could create a folder (as it ends with \"/\")\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74671/29950637-fa1ee540-8e71-11e7-90d0-34873b46ef82.png)\r\n\r\nMerging the \"new file\" and \"new folder\" with this feature will really make creating new file structure much more efficient. This will only save some few seconds per operation, but will bring much satisfaction. \r\n\r\n\r\n(This was one of my top Sublime Text plugins, and would fit perfectly in the current default VSCode new file UI)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33624","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33624/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33624/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33624/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33624","id":254500758,"number":33624,"title":"pylint","user":{"login":"Inhee-LEE","id":11070385,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11070385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Inhee-LEE","html_url":"https://github.com/Inhee-LEE","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Inhee-LEE/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Inhee-LEE/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Inhee-LEE/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Inhee-LEE/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Inhee-LEE/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Inhee-LEE/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Inhee-LEE/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Inhee-LEE/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Inhee-LEE/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-08-31T23:58:49Z","updated_at":"2017-09-01T06:35:06Z","closed_at":"2017-09-01T06:35:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.15.1 (41abd21afdf7424c89319ee7cb0445cc6f376959, 2017-08-16T18:05:38.342Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.15063\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\nExtension|Author (truncated)|Version\r\n---|---|---\r\nhtml-snippets|abu|0.1.0\r\npython|don|0.7.0\r\nvscode-html-css|ecm|0.1.8\r\nview-in-default-application|see|3.3.0\r\nlorem-ipsum|Tyr|1.0.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.\r\n2.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes/No","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33623","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33623/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33623/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33623/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33623","id":254499353,"number":33623,"title":"HTML Formatter flattens YAML Front Matter","user":{"login":"chrisbrownie","id":5036744,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5036744?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisbrownie","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisbrownie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisbrownie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisbrownie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisbrownie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisbrownie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisbrownie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisbrownie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisbrownie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisbrownie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisbrownie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":293381932,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/html","name":"html","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-31T23:48:59Z","updated_at":"2017-09-01T00:14:26Z","closed_at":"2017-09-01T00:14:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.15.1 (41abd21afdf7424c89319ee7cb0445cc6f376959, 2017-08-16T18:07:25.676Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.15063\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\nExtension|Author (truncated)|Version\r\n---|---|---\r\npython|don|0.7.0\r\nvscode-great-icons|emm|2.1.15\r\ncpptools|ms-|0.12.3\r\nPowerShell|ms-|1.4.1\r\ndebugger-for-edge|msj|0.4.1\r\n\r\n(1 theme extensions excluded)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
