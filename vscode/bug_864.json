Try editing a file with VSCode (tried HTML & TS files and both exhibit same problem)\n\nThis started happening after I installed VS2015 Update 3 (because VSCode kept wanting .NET Core 1.0 SDK or whatever it's called). It continues happening after I uninstalled VS2015 though.\n\nI used a free screen recorder to show the issue but it's not the best. Hopefully it should give you an idea. First I try just holding down arrow to scroll through the file. You can see the freeze & jump. Then I try continuously typing. Again freeze then jump. This makes using VSCode VERY painful. Please let me know if there is any debugging info I can provide.\n\nI cannot include a avi file with this bug report but it is available in this

VSCode Version: 1.4.0-insiders\n- OS Version: OSX\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open Project with large number of files\n2. Search for something\n\nSearch will start running but then it will get stuck (or gets very slow - waited 15 min and did not finish) - CPU is at > 100%\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1723815/17177175/226a4082-53de-11e6-98be-ded12c25ac16.png)\n\nI know that there is related task to speed of search https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/55\n\nBut I would like to propose 2 small things that would help:\n1. Ability to stop the search - especially if its very slow/stuck - right now the only option is to kill VSCode\n2. Some progress indication so user can know that it is still searching (and not stuck) - eg. atom shows number of files that it searched

settings cause errors. but at the same time there is a lot of repo churn in that project directory, so adding the same setting everytime isn't ideal. Also at the same time including the settings in the repo would be commitment to a single editor.
