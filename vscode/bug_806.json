Press Cmd-P\n2. Start searching for a file you haven't yet searched for in a large project (the file doesn't even have to exist - I just did 'asdf' to verify)\n3. Cmd-Tab away to another app\n4. Cmd-Tab back to code\n5. Your Cmd-P search has disappeared and (to all appearances) been canceled.\n\nThis is especially frustrating given it can sometimes take near a minute for results on large projects (I'm working on https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central) and I would like to be able to tab away from code to finish reading the bug I'm working on while it searches the files. As it stands, I have to just wait for code to finish

vscode provides for symbols, definitions, references, etc, I think it would be great if there was some guidance (best practices) documentation on how a language _should_ provide the information. For example, when implementing a `DocumentSymbolProvider` what should the range be of the symbol? TypeScript/JavaScript/JSON seem to include the body of a symbol (that has one), where as C# (Omnisharp) only provides a range covering just the keyword alone. Which one is _right_ or more accurately which one is provides more to build upon and should be considered the better practice.\n\nAlso along the same lines -- there is a LOT of power in the `vscode.executeDocumentSymbolProvider`, `vscode.executeReferenceProvider`, and others, but from the documentation I don't think it is really clear. For example, utilizing both `vscode.executeDocumentSymbolProvider` and `vscode.executeReferenceProvider` together, once should be able to create a single extension to provide usage CodeLens support for any language that supports those providers -- without the need of every language adding that type of support.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11586","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11586/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11586/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11586/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11586","id":175260969,"number":11586,"title":"Launcher
