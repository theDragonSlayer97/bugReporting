it would be awesome if there was some way to easily identify which open VSCODE window is which project.  Preferably with a color coding system similar to how the bottom git bar is colored.  \r\n\r\n_Top Bar_\r\nPerhaps the top bar with the project name / file name could be utilized to change the background color. Maybe the user settings could implement something like: `\"window.titleBar\": [ { \"path\": \"/project/location\", \"bar_color\": \"#5a6b7c\", \"font_color\": \"#ffffff\" } ]` which defaults to the current (based of theme?) color settings.\r\n\r\n_Side Bar_\r\nOr perhaps colorize the side bar which houses Explorer, Search, Git, etc. it could use a similar implementation: `\"window.sideBar\": [ { \"path\": \"/project/location\", \"bar_color\": \"#5a6b7c\", \"icon_color\": \"#ffffff\" } ]`\r\n\r\nI dont know if this feature exists already in the form of an extension, i did a search but couldnt find something that matched what i needed.  If anyone knows an extension or even a value to set in the settings, i would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you, and keep up the good

Probably I'm not the only one that uses VSCode on NFS Folders or slow filesystems. \r\n\r\nRight now, when saving a file (cmd+s), the modified file indicator (white dot) dissapears only when the save is done, but there is no indicator for \"you have already pressed save\" or \"saving is in progress\". Its really painful because on slow filesystems or slow networks the save process can take up to 10s and its easy to forget if you already pressed save.\r\n\r\nA simple solution would be to change the \"white dot\" to something else while saving. \r\n\r\n### Current behaviour:\r\n\r\nPending Changes:\r\n<img width=\"115\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-03-07 at 17 49 08\"

VSCode Version: 1.10.1\r\n- OS Version: macOS Sierra\r\n\r\nIt would be absolutely great to have a possibility to allow VSCode to open New Task Output window for each triggered task. Why? It is a must have especially when running tests by Task. Because every newly triggered task clears the output of previous test run...and that's a pain if you don't remember all the test failures (no one does ;), because then you have to run all tests again. Uselessly, just because you triggered something after the first test run.\r\n\r\nIt could have the same ComboBox UI as more Terminal windows have.\r\n\r\n(and use Terminal itself to run tests is not

I try to follow the prompt here:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"node2\" is no longer supported, use \"node\" instead and set the \"protocol\" attribute to \"inspector\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd modify my launch.json like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n    \"configurations\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": \"Launch Extension\",\r\n            \"type\": \"node\",\r\n            \"protocol\": \"inspector\",\r\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n            \"runtimeExecutable\": \"${execPath}\",\r\n            \"args\": [\"--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceRoot}\" ],\r\n            \"stopOnEntry\": false,\r\n            \"env\": {\r\n                \"NODE_ENV\": \"development\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut got the connection timeout error here:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCannot connect to runtime process, timeout after 10000 ms - (reason: Cannot connect to the target: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:28486).\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4908","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"9CD3:366E:749B07:F5BDF9:59D93955","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=455>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=453>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"ec8fa5e48e9ef1903a0b55050208e638\"","status":"200 OK"}}
