like terminal.css defines its own colors for scrolling ([here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/terminal/electron-browser/media/scrollbar.css#L6)). I suggest to pick up the [colors from our theming service](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/platform/theme/common/colorRegistry.ts#L181) for scrollbars. An example for how to produce CSS to replace the hardocded colors can be found for example in [feedback.ts](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/feedback/electron-browser/feedback.ts#L349)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26285","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26285/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26285/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26285/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26285","id":227313327,"number":26285,"title":"Keyboard: Space -> close the intellisense suggestions panel or insert a space","user":{"login":"fix777","id":19484638,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19484638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fix777","html_url":"https://github.com/fix777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fix777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fix777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fix777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fix777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fix777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fix777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fix777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fix777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fix777/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true},{"id":421907356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/suggest","name":"suggest","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-05-09T10:02:01Z","updated_at":"2017-05-10T08:04:11Z","closed_at":"2017-05-10T08:04:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
