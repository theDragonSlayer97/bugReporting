well\r\nas the navigation contribution by @misoguy\r\nI think some files need to be moved around.\r\nmy first implementation was based on toggleSideBarVisibility\r\nbut I think the more recent code  add\r\nthe commands to actions.ts\r\n\r\nThe next step is to flush out support for the editors\r\nwhere more than one is visible. and re- factor\r\nper suggestion input.\r\n\r\nThanks for
