Used Yeoman generator to boilerplate a simple VSCode extension. (basically \"Hello world\")\n2. The extension runs great , launches from \"DEBUG > Launch Extension\" menu as expected.\n3. I tried to add a source file (customfunctions.js) to the src directory, but it never gets copied to the output directory when the extension is compiled/launched.\n\nDetails:\nI've got what seems like it should be a simple thing to do. I want to add a Javascript source file to my \"build/compile\" process of my VS Code extension. This seems like it should be simple enough, so I added a copy task to the scripts field in the package.json of the extension project. Like so:\n\n```\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"copy:dist\": \"cp src/customfunctions.js out/src\",\n    \"vscode:prepublish\": \"node ./node_modules/vscode/bin/compile\",\n    \"compile\": \"npm run copy:dist && node ./node_modules/vscode/bin/compile -watch -p ./\",\n    \"postinstall\": \"node ./node_modules/vscode/bin/install\"\n},\n```\n\nThe rest of the VS Code extension project is just a boilerplate VSCode extension generated from a Yeoman generator. I literally just have these files in my extension project src directory :\n- the two files boilerplate for the extension-  extension.ts and myDocumentContentProvider.ts\n- my custom javascript file customfunctions.js\n\nWhen I use the 'DEBUG > Launch Extension' mention to test my extension the \"Launch Extension\" (again boilerplate) has \"preLaunchTask\": \"npm\" which I assume runs my package.json and should compile the TS files and (in my case) copy the one js file I've added.\n\nBut, for some reason, this doesn't work. My file isn't copied. In fact, the TS files are compiled and the results copied to out/src, but MY custom JS file is not copied.\n\nAnd, **yes**, I went through all the documentation on extensions (including https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-manifest ), but nothing explains a working way to do this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13267","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13267/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13267/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13267/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13267","id":181259035,"number":13267,"title":"Allow

Follow test plan to enable in product release notes in insiders https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12520\n2. Help > Release Notes\n3. Try to drag the release notes to the side to start a new editor group.\n\nThe release notes editor is closed and the user is directed to the release notes on the website.\n\nThis happens when the release notes are in preview mode or as a persistent editor after doing the **Keep Open** command.\n\nThis might be related to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13105 which has been fixed and included in the October release. Given this is likely a common action for users who want to review the release notes next to another editor group, we may want to fix this for September.\n\nThe workaround is to drag the release notes to an existing editor group.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13258","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13258/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13258/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13258/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13258","id":181219116,"number":13258,"title":"Zen Mode","user":{"login":"TheColorRed","id":1571806,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1571806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheColorRed","html_url":"https://github.com/TheColorRed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheColorRed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheColorRed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheColorRed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheColorRed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheColorRed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheColorRed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheColorRed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheColorRed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheColorRed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-05T17:37:57Z","updated_at":"2016-10-05T18:22:51Z","closed_at":"2016-10-05T18:22:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It would be nice to be able to go into a mode where the current document takes up the entire editor.\n\nThis would mean hiding everything except for:\n- Menu bar\n- Status bar\n- Current document\n\nToggling zen mode could be done like so: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>\n\nAnd now for some sweet GIMP skills to show how this would look (line numbers could potentially be toggled too):\n\n![vscode-zen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1571806/19124239/0083924c-8af8-11e6-8fac-16f640da8380.png)\n\nAs you can see everything is gone.
