Think maybe there is a blocking issue, but can find nothing obvious with that commit\r\n6. Download code-insiders manually and see that you get a newer version (1.15.0-1499795530), so be sad that the repo is just out of date.\r\n\r\nToo much post-4th of July partying at the VS Code team? 😉\r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4374","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"E89B:3670:A3F5F6:1A68C57:59D93432","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=179>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=177>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"57abac3adfa88989ddc46b8b83a793a8\"","status":"200 OK"}}
