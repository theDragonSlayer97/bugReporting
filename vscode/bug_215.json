here:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/44724461/task-output-encoding-in-vscode\r\n\r\nCuriously, invoking the above program with 'Run Python File in Terminal' does not have this problem, the

Place the cursor after \"div\" in the first line, then type ` style` and hit the Tab key.\r\n2. Place the cursor after \"div\" in the second line, then type ` test` and hit the Tab key.\r\n3. Place the cursor after \"style\" in the third line, then hit the Tab key.\r\n4. Place the cursor after \"test\" in the fourth line, then hit the Tab key.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n1. <div style=\"\"></div>\r\n2. <div test=\"\"></div>\r\n3. <div style=\"\"></div>\r\n4. <div test=\"\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nLess expected but would-be-okay result:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n1. <div style></div>\r\n2. <div test></div>\r\n3. <div style></div>\r\n4. <div test></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n1. <div style=\"\"></div>\r\n2. <div <test></test>></div>\r\n3. <div <style></style>></div>\r\n4. <div <test></test>></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the issue with the actual result is obvious. I would rather have the editor do nothing on Tab than creating tags in attribute context (and, as a user, having to remember not to use Tab at all in attribute context because it’s just too funky 😀 ).\r\n\r\nNote: I looked at the list of issues tagged \"html\", and didn’t find an pre-existing issue.
