am looking for something like what Sublime Text does. In Sublime Text, you can define a \"build system\" which may be associated with a file extension. The build system is a user-defined shell command. You can then build a file with your build system without having to have a project or workspace set up. However when I try to do the same thing in vscode using \"build tasks\", I get an error saying \"Tasks are only available on a workspace folder\". I don't want to have to create/open a workspace folder if I want to build a simple script.\r\n\r\nCould you possibly imitate the functionality of Sublime Text?\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.15\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new file (i.e. index.php)\r\n2. Go to `Tasks > Run Build Tasks` or `Tasks > Configure Tasks`\r\n3. A error notification pops up saying \"Tasks are only available on a workspace folder\"\r\n\r\nExpected Outcome:\r\nInstead of the error notification, I should be able to run and configure tasks without having a project.

It is truly cross platform and is easily available everywhere. I would request to add support for transliteration to visual studio code. Right now, if I have to type a text in a non-roman language, say Tamil, (may be for a web page or a .po file, etc.) I need to go to a browser, type the content that I want, copy it and then come back to Code and paste here. This workflow could be optimised if there is native support for transliteration within Code.\r\n\r\nWe can already change the keyboard language setting from the browser and type with a different keyboard. But what I would like to have is a more intelligent transliteration system that can potentially talk to a web API (like google https://www.google.com/inputtools/try/ ) or my own plugin. This will save some typing by intelligent auto-completion without expecting the user to type all the text. \r\n\r\nI would even try to contribute this, if this can be achieved as an extension. In case, something is not clear, please ask and I can elaborate.

For example: User opens a php file long time ago, gets recommendation for a php extension, never again opens a php file. The recommendation continues to show up today. Files/workspaces used more often should influence recommendations than files/workspaces rarely used\r\n- **Recommendations list should be short and well sorted as per relevance**. For example: the recommendation for current file type and workspace can show up before the ones based on historical usage (moved to September milestone)\r\n\r\nWe need telemetry in place to\r\n- [x] determine whether recommendations are successful\r\n- [x] assess the success of different ways of presenting recommendations\r\n- associate extensions with features like format/lint/completion/outline etc This can in the future help in recommending by category (moved to September milestone)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32422/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32421","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32421/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32421/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32421/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32421","id":249884730,"number":32421,"title":"Ability to toggle showing CodeLens [feature request]","user":{"login":"SirIntruder","id":5102661,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5102661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntruder","html_url":"https://github.com/SirIntruder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntruder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntruder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntruder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntruder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntruder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntruder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntruder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntruder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirIntruder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-08-13T16:48:56Z","updated_at":"2017-08-13T22:19:31Z","closed_at":"2017-08-13T21:52:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"First, big shout out for guy behind Toggle CodeLens extensions, which toggles editor.codeLens value in the settings on keyboard shortcut.\r\n\r\nCodeLens is very useful, the problem with it is it can easily take an unhealthy amount of space in some situations relatively to the amount of code. I keep it on most of the time, and want to the hide it from time to time.\r\n\r\nWhat is currently missing with \"toggle editor.codeLens\" method is that: 1) it does full rebuild of the index, which can take up some time and is annoying 2) I think enabling it while on page doesn't make CodeLens pop in back as you would expect, looks like it checks for value only on page load.\r\n\r\nI can imagine having \"codeLensHidden\" bool which would just toggle code lens on UI level, but I assume keeping cache between codeLens disable/enable to be possible\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32420","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32420/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32420/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32420/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32420","id":249883894,"number":32420,"title":"Variables
