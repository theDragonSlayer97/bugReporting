investigating syncing the scrolling of the markdown preview window to the editor. I have an implementation working using the `revealLine` command, but it is fairly jittery. In order to smooth out scrolling and continue using `revealLine` or similar existing apis, I believe that one approach would be supporting revealing line numbers that are not whole numbers.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-01-19 at 12 49 00 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12821956/22124732/e286b75a-de45-11e6-9059-3ba4751202ce.png)\r\n\r\nI see two possible ways we could implement this:\r\n\r\n* Use fractional line numbers to indicate the view line to reveal. In the example, a reveal of line `12.5` in the above document would reveal the third viewport line of line 12 in the editor. This still not allow entirely smooth scrolling since it would be locked to viewport lines, but it would be better than our current approach.\r\n\r\n* Use fractional line numbers to indicate the progress between two lines. In this case, a reveal of line `12.5` would reveal the position halfway between line 12 and line 13 in the editor. This would not map to a specific line, so scrolling could be smoother.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course we could also investigate creating a new api to support this use case. Just tossing out some initial thoughts here to see what people think.\r\n\r\n@kieferrm @egamma  @bpasero @jrieken: Any thoughts?

Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.9.0-insider@215a0a\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create code with inherited .eslint.js\r\n2. Open it\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: seems possible this is related to eslint plugin, but the issue is only occuring in the insider build, not in the last release build, both with the same version of the plugin (1.2.2) and the same config.\r\n\r\nI have the following config:\r\n\r\n    ./.eslintrc.js\r\n    ./test/\r\n    ./test/.eslintrc.js\r\n\r\nThe `test/.eslintrc.js` inherits the root:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n'use strict';\r\nlet root = require('../.eslintrc.js')\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = Object.assign({}, root, {\r\n    \"env\": {\r\n        \"mocha\": true,\r\n        \"node\": true\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\neslint config is working as expected from CLI, and the UI doesn't show any squiggly errors for issues that aren't expected. But does show them for actual issues, as expected -- I added `reallyNotDefined` to demonstrate that. \r\n\r\nBut the problem log is filled with errors that indicate the inner `.eslintrc.js` is not being parsed when testing files below it. (nb, this seems pretty odd to me, why would the UI be using a different set of output than the problem log for jslint errors? does eslint get run twice all the time, once for the UI and once for the problem log?)\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/573056/22114077/45c10fb0-de36-11e6-916e-8daec8684e85.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18793","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18793/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18793/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18793/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18793","id":201898515,"number":18793,"title":"Quick
