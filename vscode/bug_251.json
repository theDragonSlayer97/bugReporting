was looking at porting some of the Chrome DevTools features over to VSCode: timeline / profiler to start with, maybe elements / sidebar.\r\n\r\nAll my controls have rich UI that I would like to surface either as editors or as views in the console drawer. I was using ``TextDocumentContentProvider`` to render my content. Some of the limitations of the extensibility system I hit were:\r\n\r\n- Webviews are re-created on switching editor tabs (removed from DOM?). That does not work for my rich stateful controls, would be nice to retain those. I know that reparenting is impossible with the regular iframes, not sure whether webview / oopif can make it work at this point. I can look into it on the browser side if you are interested in retaining them on your side. In Chrome DevTools we use the \"hideOnDetach\" trick for extensions where we remove elements from render tree, while retaining them in DOM to keep them alive.\r\n\r\n- Bi-directional communication channel between webview content and extension. I need to be able to post messages back and forth and existing uni-directional ``href=command:`` trick does not satisfy my use cases. A richer API that allows evaluating arbitrary strings (appending scripts) into webview would also be handy. I don't think these changes affect your security model, but they would enable us to do nice things.\r\n\r\n- Contribute UI views next to Terminal and Console. For some of my controls it makes sense to surface them beside editor as an auxiliary or shell view.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28263/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28262","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28262/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28262/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28262/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28262","id":234686066,"number":28262,"title":"Duplicated path in integrated terminal","user":{"login":"mplachter","id":15329913,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15329913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mplachter","html_url":"https://github.com/mplachter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mplachter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mplachter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mplachter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mplachter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mplachter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mplachter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mplachter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mplachter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mplachter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-08T23:47:06Z","updated_at":"2017-06-09T01:10:25Z","closed_at":"2017-06-09T01:10:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
