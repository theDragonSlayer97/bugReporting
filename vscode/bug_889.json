Here are the defaults at the time of writing for Linux/Windows:\n\n``` json\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+shift+c\",          \"command\": \"workbench.action.terminal.copySelection\",\n                                     \"when\": \"terminalFocus\" },\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+shift+v\",          \"command\": \"workbench.action.terminal.paste\",\n                                     \"when\": \"terminalFocus\" },\n```\n\nNotice the new `when` clause for terminal focus, the inverse is used on the same keybindings outside of the terminal so these should be tested too:\n\n``` json\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+shift+c\",          \"command\": \"workbench.action.terminal.openNativeConsole\",\n                                     \"when\": \"!terminalFocus\" },\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+shift+v\",          \"command\": \"markdown.showPreview\",\n                                     \"when\": \"!terminalFocus\" },\n```\n\nCopy should work only when the terminal has focus, paste should work anywhere. The feature should be completely disabled on Mac since <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> and <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> work there.\n#### Limitations\n- Some custom keybindings will simply not work because the terminal eats them before VS Code gets a chance to respond, this is being explored in #7240.\n- A warning will be displayed when trying to copy via the command palette since focus is dropped when the command palette is opened.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9099","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9099/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9099/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9099/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9099","id":164945504,"number":9099,"title":"Function
