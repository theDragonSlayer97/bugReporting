From https://vsicons.azurewebsites.net/, the VSTS Bowtie Icon Font collection, I suggest the following icons:\r\n\r\n- For the Welcome, search for `alert`. The second icon, which is a flag, would do the trick. Alternatively, maybe `devices` or `globe`?\r\n- For the interactive playground, search for `run`. Any of those play button icons should work perfectly. Alternatively the `log` icon is pretty good too.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20130","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20130/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20130/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20130/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20130","id":205930284,"number":20130,"title":"[Feature Request] Format option to not insert space between non-empty curly braces in TS/JS","user":{"login":"abgivant","id":3431954,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3431954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abgivant","html_url":"https://github.com/abgivant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abgivant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abgivant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abgivant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abgivant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abgivant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abgivant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abgivant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abgivant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abgivant/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":451222386,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/format","name":"format","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":291055694,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/typescript","name":"typescript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":286886536,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-07T15:53:54Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T23:43:07Z","closed_at":"2017-02-07T23:43:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.9\r\n- OS Version: Windows 8.1\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add a formatting option to not automatically insert a space between non-empty curly braces in JS and TS?\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n```javascript\r\nvar prop = 1;\r\nvar obj = {prop};\r\n```\r\nWill get formatted as:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar prop = 1;\r\nvar obj = { prop };  \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt does appear that the space will not be inserted for empty braces (`var obj = {};`).

#20128.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the existing ShaderLab grammar, this new ShaderLab grammar delegates highlighting of Cg blocks to the separate HLSL grammar (which has the advantage that standalone HLSL

etc.\r\n\r\nI also looked at the latest `csharp.tmLanguage` so that my choice of scope names roughly matches what has been done there.\r\n\r\nBecause `.cginc` files are basically HLSL files, and not ShaderLab files, I've removed that file extension from the ShaderLab extension and included it in the HLSL extension.\r\n\r\nFor comparison, here's what ShaderLab syntax highlighting looks like in
