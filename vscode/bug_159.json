The problem is it does that after opening `foo.h` and jumping to a random `#define FOO`. It's really confusing. Look at this screenshot!

Define classes in different files and use them in other files:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n./a/b/b.ts:\r\nclass Bruno {\r\n\tconstructor () {\r\n\t\tconsole.log(\"new Bruno\");\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n./a/c/c.ts\r\nclass Cecilie {\r\n\tconstructor () {\r\n\t\tconsole.log(\"new Cecilie\");\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n./a/a.ts:\r\nclass Anne {\r\n\tconstructor () {\r\n\t\tconsole.log(\"new Anne\");\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n//  instantiate b-class in a.ts\r\nlet BrunoObject:Bruno = new Bruno;\r\nlet CecilieObject: Cecilie = new Cecilie;\r\n\r\n./main.ts\r\n// instantiate a-class in main.ts\r\nlet AnneObject:Anne = new Anne;\r\n// end main.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Code shows The `new Anne` works fine but `new Bruno` and `new Cecilie` do not, which is probably because the order intellisense use is random order. \r\n3. TSC will also give error messages:\r\n```\r\na/a.ts(15,29): error TS2449: Class 'Bruno' used before its declaration.\r\na/a.ts(16,34): error TS2449: Class 'Cecilie' used before its declaration.\r\nmain.ts(11,27): error TS2449: Class 'Anne' used before its declaration.\r\n```\r\n4. Add the following to `tsconfig.json`:\r\n```\r\n\"files\": [\r\n    \"a/b/b.ts\",\r\n    \"a/c/c.ts\",\r\n    \"a/a.ts\",\r\n    \"main.ts\"\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\nand save\r\n5. TSC now compiles without any error messages, but intellisense still reports the TS error.\r\n6. Close Code (or just Folder)\r\n7. Open Code (or folder)\r\n8. Intellisense does not show errors anymore\r\n9. Remove files section from `tsconfig.json`\r\n10. Intellisense does still not show errors\r\n11. TSC cannot compile without errors.\r\n\r\nFunctions do not have the same issue (due to JS hoisting I assume)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nI would expect Code to re-read tsconfig.json, when saved.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces without extensions: **\r\nNo. The intellisense error messages (red lines) does not appear when loading with `code --disable-extensions`.
