disappear if File Icon Theme is set to None. This is a bug in my opinion as custom views don't necessarily have anything to do with files and more critically the icons may carry semantic information that is now lost, making some extensions (including mine, see below) unusable. The extension that provides the view should have the ability to decide whether the view should follow the File Icon Theme option or not. I suggest to revert the relevant change and discuss the intended behaviour before committing to anything.\r\n\r\n[![](https://github.com/letmaik/vscode-git-tree-compare/raw/master/screenshots/main.png)](https://github.com/letmaik/vscode-git-tree-compare)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/530988/29190260-557b0a66-7e11-11e7-9a56-68c599956388.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32254","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32254/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32254/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32254/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32254","id":249463401,"number":32254,"title":"Windows:

I can specify a `preLaunchTask` field in a launch configuration to run a task before launching. That's great! To use preLaunchTask, I need to give my task an identifier first. Typically, I want to run the default build task before I launch, though. VSCode already knows which task is the default build task, so I feel like there should be a way to tell VSCode to run this task without giving it an identifier.\r\n\r\nIf one of my tasks.json entries contains the following snippet, VSCode knows that this is the default build task:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"group\": {\r\n\t\"kind\": \"build\",\r\n\t\"isDefault\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat if there were a field in launch.json named something like `preLaunchBuild` that could be set to `true` to tell it to run the default build task before launching? `preLaunchTask` would still be useful for running other tasks, but if I just want to run the default build task, I don't need to take the extra step of giving the default build task its own identifier.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32239/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32238","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32238/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32238/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32238/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32238","id":249427488,"number":32238,"title":"Improve

are two APIs we need to finalize: **Monaco** and **VSCode**.\r\n\r\nBoth APIs are identical except in terms of color formatters: VSCode supports a [declarative format for color formats](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L178), while Monaco supports [more generic function-style formatters](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/editor/common/modes.ts#L687).\r\n\r\n**Discussion Points**\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Color value ranges** - We have a very peculiar [`Color` class](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/base/common/color.ts) internally, which has predefined value ranges for color components. RGB is stored in ranges of `[0-255]`, for example. I am more in favor of using floating point `[0-1]` ranges for all color coordinates in the API. This is what is currently implemented. We just need consensus on the approach.\r\n- [ ] **`Color.fromHex`** - I suggest we keep this in proposed state until #32295 is fixed, at which point it can be completely removed.\r\n- [ ] **Color Insertion** - The current API works great with colors which are already in the document. Both the API and the color picker widget don't work really well when the user wants to _insert_ a new color. This needs thought. I think we can surface this as a feature request so we can get the API out the door asap.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32235/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32234","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32234/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32234/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32234/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32234","id":249424343,"number":32234,"title":"SCM:
