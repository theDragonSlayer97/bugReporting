The window resize based on which of the corners or sides is closest. (You can test the functionality in windows with AltDrag). This makes resizing windows SO fast, you don't have to \"aim\" for a precise edge of the window, you just go very approximately and it will resize like you want. This is a huge help when you want to have multiple windows open on a single page. \r\n\r\nSo, the feature I would like to have is to be able to resize the panes more quickly than I can now. When I'm working with 2 or especially 3 panes opened, I find myself resizing the panes often. I want to see more of the code I'm working on currently, but I like to keep the other panes there for the references to functions/tests/etc I'm calling. When I'm finished working on that file, I resize the panes and start working in another pane. If I could hold alt, center click my mouse close to a pane edge to resize the panes, (or something similar) it would save me a lot of time.

settings are properly grouped. First group is always Most commonly used followed by others.\r\n- Navigate (expand/collapse) groups and see the settings\r\n- Default settings and Settings file are shown side by side in single editor. Closing the editor closes both.\r\n- Change the Settings of the editor which can impact Default settings editor and make sure it is not impacted and shown properly. For eg., change font size and see how default settings editor is shown. Similarly change other editor specific settings like indentation etc.\r\n- Repeat the same by opening Workspace settings\r\n- Play around by placing them in same group and in different groups.\r\n- Also try to copy/paste settings from left to right and test that settings are applied\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- Use the Search box to find a setting. You can search for content in setting description, key, value. \r\n- Test that settings are filtered as expected. Settings with no matches in descriptions, key, value are not shown.\r\n- Use key `Enter` to navigate through filtered settings\r\n- Check that count is shown correctly\r\n- Pressing `Ctrl+F` or `Cmd+F` in Default Settings Editor focuses the search box\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- In Default settings editor, Hovering on a setting shows a copy action icon\r\n- Clicking on it will either\r\n    a. Copy the setting into the editor on the side, if the setting is not of enum or boolean type\r\n    b. Shows context menu to select a value, if the setting is of enum or boolean type. On selecting the value copies the setting with selected value to the side.\r\n- Above action is also available in the Editable Settings editor on the right only for boolean or enum settings. Clicking on them and selecting the value changes the value for the setting.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16529","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16529/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16529/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16529/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16529","id":193569075,"number":16529,"title":"An

feature suggestion: Middle mouse click scrolling\r\n\r\nThis is another feature that is supported by Visual Studio and Edge that would be useful in VSCode.\r\n\r\nWhen the middle mouse click is pressed, it toggles the cursor to a quad-directional arrow.  Once that is toggled, moving the mouse in relation to where the mouse was when toggled, will scroll the page in the corresponding direction.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16514/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16513","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16513/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16513/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16513/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16513","id":193539493,"number":16513,"title":"Classic scroll functions / page up/down","user":{"login":"SailorMax","id":6195377,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6195377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SailorMax","html_url":"https://github.com/SailorMax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SailorMax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SailorMax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SailorMax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SailorMax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SailorMax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SailorMax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SailorMax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SailorMax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SailorMax/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":425577013,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-core","name":"editor-core","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-12-05T16:09:09Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T10:23:43Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.7.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 x64\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.  open any long file\r\n2.  click in middle of scroll bar\r\n\r\nExpected: Page Down\r\n\r\nActual: Goto Scroll position where I clicked minus scroll cursor height/2.
