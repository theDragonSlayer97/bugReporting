Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.12.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. New Feature Request\r\n\r\nCurrently when open new file while editing file, code defaults it to language mode for text file. It would be nice if when you initiate open file command while a tab is active, code will set language mode of the new file to same as current file you were just working in. For example lets say i am currently writing query in sql script file with .sql extension and i hit `Ctrl + N` while tab is focused, code opens new file with \"SQL\" language mode already set. Or if i have another tab where i am editing json and it is set to JSON language mode, when i hit `Ctrl + N` code will then open new file set to JSON language mode already. You can also provide a setting to enable/disable this feature based on your preference.
