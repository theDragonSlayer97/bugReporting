Environment\n- VSCode, Version 0.10.7-insider (0.10.7-insider), 6c2d51a4b7b81753a3a4c46f9de9a15179e20304\n  - with enabling Salsa preview\n- typescript@1.9.0-dev.20160201\n  - which is specified with `typescript.tsdk`\n## Description\n\nThe closure compiler style JSDoc [allows the generics like `Array<T>`](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler), not only `Array.<T>`.\nBut the above environment shows the argument styled with its style as `any` in the intellisense.\n### problem case\n\n``` javascript\n/**\n * @params {Array<string>} v\n * @return {string}\n */\nfunction bar(v) { // \n  return v.join();\n}\n\nvar b = bar([\"1\", \"2\"]); // Intellisense shows this signature as `bar(v: any)`;\n```\n### non-problem case\n\nIt's ok `Array.<T>` or `T[]`which is allowed in http://usejsdoc.org/tags-type.html\n\n``` javascript\n/**\n * @params {Array.<string>} v\n * @return {string}\n */\nfunction foo(v) {\n  return v.join();\n}\n\nvar b = foo([\"1\", \"2\"]); // Intellisense shows this signature as `foo(v: any)`;\n```\n### What I expect\n\nI want Salsa interprets the closure compiler style's generics annotation.\nBy any chance, I should report this to
