to https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc/issues/987#issuecomment-93864964, JSDoc for destructured function parameters should be possible:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/**\r\n * My cool function.\r\n *\r\n * @param {Object} obj - An object.\r\n * @param {string} obj.prop1 - Property 1.\r\n * @param {string} obj.prop2 - Property 2.\r\n */\r\nvar fn = function ({prop1, prop2}) {\r\n  // Do something with prop1 and prop2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when invoking the function, while Intellisense appears to support properties inside the object param, there is no documentation for individual params inside the destructured object, and the property types are not honored (shown as `any` instead):\r\n![jsdoc-destructuring](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/51629/24177182/ed78261a-0e5d-11e7-8f0c-2b2c32534def.png)\r\n\r\nIf I set parameter defaults, Intellisense will support those, but will still ignore the types specified in the doc comment (notice that the JSDoc comment is not consistent with the function definition):\r\n![jsdoc-destructuring-defaults](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/51629/24177353/14353170-0e5f-11e7-985c-ce8f0bee1eff.png)\r\n\r\nAnd in both cases, the entire object param is highlighted, but individual params inside it are not.\r\n\r\nIs there a different way to write the JSDoc comment, or does support for destructured parameters need to be supported by VS Code as well?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22979","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22979/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22979/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22979/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/22979","id":215910192,"number":22979,"title":"Add

Users have remarked that when they restart VS Code after using this terminal, the terminal UI starts immediately with their default terminal app before the PowerShell Integrated Console has a chance to load.  More specifically:\r\n\r\n1. User starts VS Code without the Terminal panel active\r\n2. User has PowerShell 0.10.0 installed, loads a .ps1 file\r\n3. PowerShell extension loads, creates PowerShell Interactive Console, causing Terminal panel to show\r\n4. User closes VS Code\r\n5. Later, user opens VS Code and the Terminal panel appears at startup, loading their default terminal app (probably powershell.exe)\r\n6. If a .ps1 file is active in the workspace at startup, the \"PowerShell Integrated Console\" will also be loaded into the Terminal panel\r\n\r\nSo basically the user ends up having an extra, unwanted process get launched at startup.  I've tried [closing my terminal](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/blob/develop/src/session.ts#L194) at shutdown from my extension's [deactivate function](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/blob/develop/src/main.ts#L135) but even that doesn't prevent the terminal UI from loading upon next startup.\r\n\r\nIs there any way I can
