this is wishful thinking but I am experiencing many subtle issues with the relatively new [`editor.autoIndent` feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_14#_auto-indent-on-type-move-lines-and-paste). It's a very useful one and I want to keep it but it misbehaves quite frequently, see e.g. issues #29390, #32333 and [many others](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Aeditor-indentation%20label%3Abug). Quite a good example is this (from #32835):\r\n\r\nIndentation via Format Document:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconst MyReactComponent = (props) => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <Helmet titleTemplate='%s'>\r\n                <title>Hello</title>\r\n            </Helmet>\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFormatting via Reindent Lines:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconst MyReactComponent = (props) => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n        <Helmet titleTemplate='%s'>\r\n        <title>Hello</title>\r\n        </Helmet>\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt often seems to me that [formatting API](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/11/15/formatters-best-practices) produces better results than [indentation rules](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_14#_auto-indent-on-type-move-lines-and-paste) but even if that wasn't always the case it just seems logical to have a single API to power both features. It seems like this to me:\r\n\r\n1. **Indenting** functionality cares about the **leading whitespaces**.\r\n2. **Formatting** cares about the above **_plus_ anything after the first non-whitespace character**.\r\n\r\nSo it's a subset / superset problem and I don't think it should be implemented twice, in a completely different manner. What do you think? Would there be a chance to unify the two APIs and eliminate some bugs along the way?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor reference, some key issues related to this:\r\n\r\n- Auto Indent / Code Formatting / Beautify #4039\r\n- improve indentation rules #17868\r\n- Options for automatic indentation #19303\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34620","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34620/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34620/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34620/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34620","id":258731104,"number":34620,"title":"Toggle

VS Code ranks and highlights matched string parts.\r\n\r\nWhen a user chooses “Go to Symbol in Workspace”:\r\n\r\n1. If the language extension has registered a [`WorkspaceSymbolProvider`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api#WorkspaceSymbolProvider), the `provideWorkspaceSymbols` method is called with a query string.\r\n2. The language extension returns a list of symbols in the workspace that match the query string. In this case, the **extension** filters the list to match what the user has typed.\r\n3. VS Code ranks and highlights matched string parts.\r\n\r\nSo the main difference is that for a document VS Code is doing the string matching, but for a workspace the extension is doing the string matching. This produces inconsistencies because they are not using the same matching algorithm. The problem is the same regardless of whether the language extension is doing the symbol matching within the extension process or as part of a client/server model.\r\n\r\nThis difference in behaviour has led to multiple issues in the past (e.g. #20039 – \"Go to symbol\" looks like only take care of upper cases). Within my [vscode-zoneinfo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gilmoreorless.vscode-zoneinfo) extension, I’m using a knowingly-naïve string matching method for the `provideWorkspaceSymbols` method, because I know that I’m almost guaranteed to have different results from the single-file symbol matching.\r\n\r\nI don’t have a definitive solution, but I do have some suggestions.\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Change `provideDocumentSymbols` to accept a query string\r\n\r\n**Pro:**\r\nIf the `provideDocumentSymbols` method accepted an extra argument for the query string, an extension could then use the same internal methods for matching document and workspace symbols consistently.\r\n\r\n**Con:**\r\nOf course, this continues to have the current downside that different extensions will match symbols in different ways, so there will still be inconsistent results across languages.\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Provide a shared API for symbol name matching\r\n\r\nThere have been many issues raised previously about the fuzzy-ish string matching behaviour in VS Code, collected in a single meta-issue at #27317. If there are going to be changes to the string matching behaviour, it would be a good opportunity to provide the matcher as an API for extensions.\r\n\r\n**Pro:**\r\nIf an extension’s `provideWorkspaceSymbols` method could call something like `vscode.matchString(symbolName, query)`, there would be consistency between document and workspace symbol matching.\r\n\r\n**Con:**\r\nThis would only work for language extensions that find symbols within the extension process. I presume that most language extensions use the language server protocol instead, so they won’t be able to use a `vscode.*` API.\r\n\r\nA partial solution to this could be to provide the string matcher as a separate Node.js module (or use one of a few existing ones), which can then be included in VS Code as well as a language server. Unfortunately that only helps language servers that use the Node.js ecosystem. Thinking out loud... maybe provide an open abstract description of the matching algorithm, so that other language servers could implement it as well? Though that has veered wildly into massively over-engineering a solution to a relatively minor problem...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34604","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34604/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34604/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34604/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34604","id":258650581,"number":34604,"title":"Debugging:

found that even though we continued and the thread was stopped on thread 5, VSCode seems to want to request info about the first frame on thread 1 (see the `scopes` request on `frameid 1008`) without me switching the frame in the UI. This makes it so that the stopped frame is not visible in the UI either. \r\n\r\nI think the proper behavior here is to have the scopes set on the top frame of the stopped thread. \r\n\r\n@isidorn \r\n\r\nThank you @anketell for reporting this.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4512","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"B363:366F:C2A65D:17B6463:59D931BD","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=41>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=39>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"61bd3697ae020d63052ef096bdb59129\"","status":"200 OK"}}
