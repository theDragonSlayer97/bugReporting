VSCode Version: v1.1\n- OS Version: windows 10\n- nodejs Version: v6\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n( a little bit complicate)\n1. mkdir try-bugs && cd try-bugs \n2.npm install -g vue-cli\n2.vue init webpack\n3.npm install\n4.set up a task in task.json, whose command is `npm`, args is `[\"run\", \"build\"]`\n5. press `contrl + shift + b` to build the project\n6.then babel of webpack does not work in the right way\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3315274/15247779/e2c30e2a-1948-11e6-85ef-065a9c4bb524.png)\n\nFurther description and guess:\nI have install a extension of vscode called [new-cmd ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=odonno.new-cmd), which can enable you to open a new terminal from current work space directory by typing command `cmd` after pressing `f1` in vscode.\nIf I open a terminal using this extension and then run `npm run build` in this terminal, it will show me the same bug as run the build task from vscode.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3315274/15247757/cc4b29d4-1948-11e6-98da-07de74a8b956.png)\n\nHowever, if I open a terminal manually by right click and run the same command, everything goes well.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3315274/15247842/53734e96-1949-11e6-9f70-fee948c954c0.png)\n\nI notice that there is one difference between the two terminal is that the disk name. The disk name in former terminal is `d:\\` while the later one is `D:\\`. \nIn the project, from one hand, there are some code, the config of webpack specifically, related to `path.join(__dirname, ...)`, which will generate an absolute path to files begin with `D:\\`. From the other hand, there are some other code use relative path to locate file, which will result in path to file begin with `d:\\`.\nI wonder whether this caused my problem or not.\nBy the way, if I repeat the process with node5, the bug disappear.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6347","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6347/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6347/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6347/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6347","id":154696406,"number":6347,"title":"The

VSCode Version: 1.1.0\n- OS Version: OSX 10.10.5\n\nHi there,\n\nFirst of all, thanks for all the great work around VS Code!\n\nI'm having an issue with overriding keybinding for `cmd+w` (which by default closes currently opened tab). I'm trying to define following bindings in order to mimic the IntelliJ IDEA bindings:\n\n```\n|| Key              || Action                           ||\n| cmd + w           | editor.action.smartSelect.grow    |\n| cmd + shift + w   | editor.action.smartSelect.shrink  |\n| cmd + f4          | workbench.action.closeWindow      |\n```\n\nUnfortunately, putting them into my keybindings doesn't result in any change.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Press F1 and select _Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts_\n2. Put the following into your keybindings definition:\n   \n   ```\n   // Place your key bindings in this file to overwrite the defaults\n   [\n       {\n           \"key\": \"cmd+f4\",\n           \"command\": \"workbench.action.closeWindow\",\n           \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\"\n       },\n       {\n           \"key\": \"cmd+w\",\n           \"command\": \"editor.action.smartSelect.grow\",\n           \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\"\n       },\n       {\n           \"key\": \"shift+cmd+w\",\n           \"command\": \"editor.action.smartSelect.shrink\",\n           \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\"\n       }\n   ]\n   ```\n3. Restart VS Code\n4. Try to expand selection using `Cmd+W`. \n\n**Expected result:**\nKeystroke expands smart selection.\n\n**Actual result:**\nCurrently opened window

VSCode Version: 1.1.0 (c212f0908f3d29933317bbc3233568fbca7944b1)\n- OS Version: Windows 10 TP5\n\nWhen the first instance of VSCode opens, it inherits the environment from whatever context it was opened from.  Any subsequent instances do not inherit their environment, instead copying the one loaded by the first instance.  So if the first instance is launched from explorer against a random file, while the second one is launched from a cmd window that has GO and GIT configured in the path, the second one will insist that GO and GIT are missing from the environment.  Reversing the order fixes the issue.\n\nEven though inheriting environment from other open instances may provide some speed boost for opening, each new instance should inherit its environment from the context it was launched in order to preserve expected behavior for users.\n\nQuick repro (using golang extension from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lukehoban.Go):\n1. Unset GOPATH environment variable in shell.\n2. Launch vscode, observe the yellow warning in the lower right indicating that GOPATH is not set.\n3. Set the GOPATH environment variable correctly.\n4. Navigate to a new folder and launch vscode again\n\nExpected:\nGOPATH should be loaded.\n\nActual:\nGOPATH is still not detected because environment is inherited from first instance.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6332","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6332/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6332/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6332/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6332","id":154577088,"number":6332,"title":"No Call Stack hover message mismatched","user":{"login":"vsccarl","id":12900364,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12900364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl","html_url":"https://github.com/vsccarl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-12T20:44:31Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T05:47:20Z","closed_at":"2016-05-13T05:47:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.1.0-alpha\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

VSCode Version: 1.1.0-alpha\n- OS Version: Windows10\n\nI am not certain if this is the real issue with product or not. But thought to give heads up if something we need to handle at API level.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Generate VSCode extension project  using Yeoman\n2. Open VS code and open generated folder.\n3. Start debugging by following instruction mentioned at  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/example-hello-world\n4. Verify debug point hit under extension project once you try to add hello world extension.\n5. Try to execute \"extension install command\" from command palette in newly launched instance of VSCOde and then clean all the text using backspace key.\nActual: Getting exception: \"\"This socket has
