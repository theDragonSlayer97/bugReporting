Open Explorer to a folder in local OneDrive location for example, ```C:\\Users\\Ryan\\Onedrive\\Github\\kilasuit\\VScodeDirTest\\```\r\n1a. Right click to bring up the ```Open with Code``` option and click it\r\n1b. Open PowerShell in the same directory, or navigate to the same directory, and run ```code .\\ ``` to open up in the directory \r\n2. Code opens a new file with the folder name, with no extension, not the folder, as a expected. \r\n\r\n---\r\nSteps to Reproduce Normal Behaviour:\r\n\r\n1. Open Explorer to a folder for example, ```C:\\temp\\VSCodeTestDir\\```\r\n1a. Right click to bring up the ```Open with Code``` option and click it\r\n1b. Open PowerShell in the same directory, or navigate to the same directory, and run ```code .\\ ``` to open up in the directory \r\n2. Code opens the folder, as expected, and lists all files within the directory\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis behaviour has only just recently come about since updating OneDrive as per the article mentioned above so I believe that it's most likely due to the update to OneDrive more than it being a Code issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29516","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29516/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29516/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29516/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29516","id":238721158,"number":29516,"title":"扩展主机意外终止。请重新加载窗口以恢复。","user":{"login":"qiziqiang","id":25959322,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25959322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiziqiang","html_url":"https://github.com/qiziqiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiziqiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiziqiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiziqiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiziqiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiziqiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiziqiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiziqiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiziqiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiziqiang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs

seen lot of discussion about the desire to customize mouse events, few of them create conflicts between the platforms.  My goal is to find references very quickly, yes Shift + F12 works but I would love to be able to use it from the mouse. Being able to fully customize mouse events like keyboard shortcuts would be handy but probably not happening soon.\r\n\r\nSo my proposal is to change the \"go to declaration behavior\", everywhere it should work as expected but in case you do Ctrl + click on the declaration itself it could change mode and would do equivalent of Shift + F12. This way all references would go to declaration and declaration would show all used references with one Ctrl + Left click event. I don't really see the need to be able to go to the declaration when you are clicking on the declaration itself. \r\n\r\nAnd I think doing the declaration peek on mouse over on the declaration itself is bit redundant as well. This could stay as it is so it's not confusing users, be disabled because there is no need for the declaration peek on the declaration itself, or be used for hover information about references? The hover information is not as essential, just wanted to point it out when I'm at it. But the click mouse event change would be improvement to the UI.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29502","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29502/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29502/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29502/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29502","id":238689271,"number":29502,"title":"nativescript with angular html conditional value","user":{"login":"dehqan","id":17086315,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/17086315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dehqan","html_url":"https://github.com/dehqan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dehqan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dehqan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dehqan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dehqan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dehqan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dehqan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dehqan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dehqan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dehqan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":409283388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/caused-by-extension","name":"caused-by-extension","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-26T22:37:48Z","updated_at":"2017-06-29T21:40:35Z","closed_at":"2017-06-29T21:40:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.13.1 (379d2efb5539b09112c793d3d9a413017d736f89, 2017-06-14T18:21:47.485Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|aessoft-class-autocomplete|AESSoft|0.1.0|\r\n|vscode-angular2-files|alexiv|1.3.8|\r\n|vscode-generate-getter-setter|DSKWRK|0.4.2|\r\n|auto-close-tag|formulahendry|0.4.2|\r\n|Angular2|johnpapa|2.3.3|\r\n|vscode-add-angular-native-files|joshdsommer|0.0.8|\r\n|angular2-inline|natewallace|0.0.17|\r\n|tns-cli|pkosta2006|0.0.3|\r\n|vscode-icons|robertohuertasm|7.10.0|\r\n|nativescript|Telerik|0.7.2|\r\n|nativescript-xml-snippets|tsvetan-ganev|1.0.4|\r\n|nativescript-ng2-snippets|wwwalkerrun|2.0.1|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nfor developing native script by angular\r\nIn .ts file, in template section write this code :\r\n<Button text=\"login\" [visibility]=\"sampleMethod() ?

for #28234:\r\n\r\nComplexity: 3\r\n\r\n- [x] any platform - @roblourens\r\n- [x] Mac OS - @sandy081 \r\n\r\nWe now have minimal \"proposed\" extension API for VS Code debugging.\r\n\r\nThe first two pieces to verify are the `createDebugSession` request for launching a debug session based on a launch config passed as an argument and the `onDidTerminateDebugSession` event which indicates that a debug session has terminated.\r\nSee https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28234#issuecomment-310486799 for details and how to use the proposed API.\r\n\r\nto verify:\r\n- create \"hello world\" extension with yo\r\n- register an \"onDidTerminateDebugSession\" handler in the `activate` function, e.g.:\r\n  ```js\r\n  context.subscriptions.push(vscode.debug.onDidTerminateDebugSession(s => { \r\n     console.log(`terminated: ${s.type} ${s.name}`);\r\n  }));\r\n\r\n- in the \"extension.sayHello\" command call \"vscode.debug.createDebugSession\", e.g.: \r\n  ```js\r\n        vscode.debug.createDebugSession({\r\n            type: 'node',\r\n            name: 'foo bar',\r\n            request: 'launch',\r\n            program: '/Users/xxx/Projects/TestProjects/test.js'\r\n

\"Hello\" command.\r\n- verify that a debug session starts\r\n- verify that termination of any debug sessions triggers an event with a DebugSession parameter that has the corresponding \"type\" and \"name\" attributes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29489","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29489/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29489/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29489/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29489","id":238646828,"number":29489,"title":"Why
