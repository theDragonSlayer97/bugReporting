it offers so much! - and it is with great regret that I must file this first bug...\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a block of text such as this one:\n\n```\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar path = require('path');\nvar rimraf = require('rimraf');\nvar isarray = require('isarray');\nvar merge = require('merge-stream');\nvar concat = require('gulp-concat');\nvar newer = require('gulp-newer');\n```\n1. Place the caret on the first line, on the left of the `var` keyword.\n2. Hold `alt + shift` and left-click on the right hand side of the `var` keyword on the last line to make a column selection.\n3. Observe that if the mouse was even a few pixels overlapped with the `space` character, the column of spaces will also be included in the selection - the selection is biased towards the right.\n4. Now repeat step two and make a single-line selection by holding shift and clicking on the right hand side of the `var` keyword on the _first_ line - observe that the selection is biased to the left - i.e. you have to be almost completely past the `space` character or else it is _excluded_ from the selection.\n\nClearly, column-select's behaviour is non-traditional in this regard.\n\nPersonally, I prefer to \"draw\" my column selections like you can in full-fat Visual Studio when you hold down `alt`. This shift-select style is fine but it should at least be consistent with U.I. norms.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4904","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4904/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4904/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4904/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4904","id":145614786,"number":4904,"title":"[loc][Query][DevDiv]

the order of ConfigurationDoneRequest and LaunchRequest is not deterministic, that means it is possible that a ConfigurationDoneRequest comes after the LaunchRequest. This is problematic because only a ConfigurationDoneRequest indicates that all breakpoints have been registered and that a LaunchRequest is able to hit all those breakpoints. If the ConfigurationDoneRequest comes after the  LaunchRequest some breakpoints might be missed.\n\nThere are two scenarios to consider:\n1. An InitializedEvent is sent early (after the InitializeRequest has been processed but before the LaunchRequest). This is used in mono-debug and mock-debug where breakpoints can be registered before launching the debuggee.\n2. An InitializedEvent is sent late (while the LaunchRequest is being processed). This is used in node-debug where node.js has to be launched first before breakpoints can be registered).\n\nFrom the first case it looks like the frontend could always wait with calling LaunchRequest until ConfigurationDoneRequest has been ended. But this would not work with the second case.\n\n/cc @isidorn \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4901","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4901/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4901/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4901/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4901","id":145608613,"number":4901,"title":"Indent ES7/Babel Object Rest/Spread Properties in arrow functions","user":{"login":"damienleroux","id":12717418,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12717418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienleroux","html_url":"https://github.com/damienleroux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienleroux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienleroux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienleroux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienleroux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienleroux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienleroux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienleroux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienleroux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienleroux/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":286886536,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-04-04T07:36:41Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T12:15:01Z","closed_at":"2016-04-04T12:15:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 0.10.13-insider\n- OS Version: window 7 Pro SP1\n\nUsing VSCode and Babel/ES7 for JavaScript, I have issues when indenting code using [the object spread operator](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread).

As there is no way to rename the file or change the extension inside explorer window so I added other file with the same name and .html extension. That took me to perform couple of actions along with copy and paste the file contents.
