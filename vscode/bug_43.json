[Azure App Service Extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azureappservice) uses ShowInputBox to prompt user for the name of the new web app to be created. Then it checks the name availability by trying to resolve the DNS name of the web app. This operation can take up to a few seconds depending on network speed.\r\n\r\nCurrently the ShowInputBox doesn't seem to support async validation function, which means we can only validate after ShowInputBox function is done and re-prompt if the DNS value turns out not available.\r\n\r\nThe optimum experience: ShowInputBox supports async validation, when the validation function is running, the input box shows a progress indicator and won't allow the value be accepted (pressing Enter won't close the box), ESC should still cancel the input

When VS Code is already launched, open a file (from command line or Windows Explorer): file is added as an editor/tab in current workspace.\r\n2. Launch VS Code by itself: All previously open files are restored.\r\n3. Launch VS code by opening a file from command line or Windows Explorer: a fresh instance is created with only that file and any unsaved files; \"clean\" previous files/folders are not restored.\r\n\r\n(3) is inconsistent with the expected behavior from both (1) and (2). It behaves almost as though `window.openFilesInNewWindow` is set to on when the application is closed, contra (1), and it ignores the expected behavior of the `window.restoreWindows` setting, contra (2). \r\n\r\nIt also gives privileged status to dirty files, which are always restored, for no sensible reason -- I can easily \"dirty up\" saved files by making a change and immediately undoing it, and it'll be restored when launching Code by opening a file. Why not just restore all files to begin with?\r\n\r\nCode already has the `-n` command line parameter for opening files in a new window, yet this also only works when Code is already launched. Both `-n` and `-r` behave identically (i.e., is ignored) when it is used to launch VS Code from a file, creating another inconsistency between newly launched and existing instances of Code.\r\n\r\nFinally, it's inconsistent with session restore behavior of Notepad++ and Sublime Text. Atom behaves like Code, but even they [admit it's counter-intuitive](https://discuss.atom.io/t/why-dont-my-project-folders-stay-open-each-time-i-start-atom/31733).\r\n\r\nAlthough #15949 is also open, I've created this separate issue because `code .` opens a new window even when VS Code is already launched. Hence the expected behavior already differs from (1) above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34529/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34528","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34528/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34528/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34528/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/34528","id":258265825,"number":34528,"title":"Avoid

VSCode promts proxy authentication required for `proxy_address:port`. If you enter same username and password which you used while setting environment variable, it will accept it and you can install any plugin etc.\r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34514/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34513","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34513/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34513/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34513/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34513","id":258234202,"number":34513,"title":"Enhancement to manage extensions - bookmark, tag, metadata","user":{"login":"bkbonner","id":667769,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/667769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkbonner","html_url":"https://github.com/bkbonner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkbonner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkbonner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkbonner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkbonner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkbonner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkbonner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkbonner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkbonner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkbonner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":343063018,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/extensions","name":"extensions","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-16T14:17:09Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T08:33:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"It would be useful to show bookmarks that I'm interested in (or that I'm not interested in).\r\n\r\nSince there are so many extensions available and new ones being developed each day.    It would be nice to have a way to tag the extensions in the gallery.   The tag could be 'bookmark', 'review', 'dontuse', etc.\r\n\r\nAfter some cursory review, It seems like this can be done using the galleryExtensionId.   We can store a list of the Ids and associated tags and metadata (comments, etc.) in a json file locally.\r\n\r\nWhenever we query the extensions, we can merge the results into the UI of the Gallery or search results.\r\n\r\nAs a start, I suspect the storing of the metadata can be done with an extension itself -- would it have access to the galleryExtension id?   It probably makes more sense to integrate this into the UI of the workspace.   \r\n\r\nI\"m posting it here, because I'm interested in feedback and thoughts on this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4509","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"8A1C:429A:80C1E0:1599A0B:59D931C9","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=44>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=42>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"5f37fac15bb5ad0401972a34389683e8\"","status":"200 OK"}}
