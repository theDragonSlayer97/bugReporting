Possible parameters:\r\n* `Always` - reload from disk\r\n* `Confirm` - show a popup/toast notification\r\n* `Never` - current behaviour?\r\n\r\nSimilar to how SublimeText works. If the files change in disk they automatically get reload, independently of their current state in the editor.

to #15513 #20818\r\n\r\nAccording to @jrieken:\r\n\r\n> each editor side is represented as an editor right now\r\n\r\nIt will be very hard to introduce a new `TextDiffEditor` type now since we'd need to adopt occurrences of `TextEditor` to become `TextEditor | TextDiffEditor` everywhere.\r\n\r\nOne idea we had is to augment the `TextEditor` interface in the following way:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface TextEditor {\r\n  // ...\r\n  readonly diffEditor?: DiffEditor;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface DiffEditor {\r\n  readonly left: TextEditor;\r\n  readonly right: TextEditor;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will enable extension authors to detect whether a `TextEditor` is contained in a `DiffEditor` and determine which side it is so.\r\n\r\nWe should augment the interface to expose the diff result as `LineChanges[]` to the extension host. One idea is to constantly synchronise this and notify the user when it has updated:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface DiffEditor {\r\n  // ...\r\n  readonly onDidChange: Event<LineChanges[]>;\r\n  readonly diff: LineChanges[];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could be spammy and so another idea is to it request based:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface DiffEditor {\r\n  // ...\r\n  readonly onDidChange: Event<Thenable<LineChanges[]>>;\r\n  readonly getDiff(): Thenable<LineChanges[]>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n@jrieken @alexandrudima Any

Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- Nodejs version: 6.9.5\r\n- OS Version: Win7\r\n\r\nFirst of all: Thanks to @weinand for helping and answering similar issues which helped me progress in running the debugger.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Using electron-forge\r\n2. Debugger setting contains the following setup: (following @weinand [help note](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7583#issuecomment-279535031)s)\r\n\r\n`\"runtimeExecutable\": \"${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron-forge.cmd\",`\r\n`\"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/src/index.js\",`\r\n `\"runtimeArgs\": [\r\n          \"start\" \r\n      ]\r\n`\r\n\r\nergo no need to set --debug-brk in the runtimeArgs. \r\n\r\n> And that will run something like: node_modules/.bin/electron-forge.cmd --debug-brk=46736 start src\\index.js\r\n\r\n3- The debugger starts and runs about 10 seconds before crashing with error:\r\n\r\n> ## Cannot connect to runtime via 'legacy' protocol; consider using 'inspector' protocol (timeout after 10000 ms)\r\n\r\nChecking on vscode documentation page:\r\n\r\n> \r\nRuntime\tnode.js:\r\n------------------\r\n- 'Legacy Protocol': **< 8.x**\t      \r\n- 'Inspector Protocol': **>= 6.3 (Windows: >= 6.9)**\r\n\r\nRuntime Electron:\r\n-------------------\r\n- 'Legacy Protocol': **all**\t      \r\n- 'Inspector Protocol':      **not yet**\r\n\r\nSo what's the case now? Electron-forge is not supported or is there something vscode could fix?\r\n\r\n_P.S. ran the debugger before successfully from a transpiled folder using electron ._ \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23088","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23088/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23088/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23088/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23088","id":216367764,"number":23088,"title":"\"Find
