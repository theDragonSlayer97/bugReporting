They include multiple fixes, in particular:\n- https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage/issues/37 \n- https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage/issues/96\n- check out multiple TS and JS files and have a look at type references and keywords.\n- test all our 4 default themes\n\nAs this update also required changes to our default themes, we also need to test the default themes with other languages:\n- [x] Bat @weinand \n- [x] Clojure @weinand \n  Known change: The light blue for definitions is gone. This was an accidental match.\n- [x] Coffeescript @weinand \n- [x] C  / C++ @weinand \n- [x] C#\n- [x] CSS @isidorn\n- [x] Docker @isidorn\n- [x] F# @isidorn\n- [x] Go @isidorn\n- [x] Groovy @bpasero \n- [x] Handlebars @bpasero \n- [x] HTML @bpasero \n- [x] Ini @bpasero \n- [x] Jade @isidorn \n- [x] Java @isidorn \n- [x] Javascript\n- [x] JSON @isidorn \n- [x] Less @isidorn \n- [x] Lua @isidorn\n- [ ] Make @alexandrudima \n- [x] Markdown\n- [ ] Objective-c @alexandrudima \n- [ ] Perl @alexandrudima \n- [ ] Php @alexandrudima \n  The PHP meta tag now has the same color as other html tags\n- [x] Powershell @isidorn \n- [x] Python @isidorn\n- [x] R @isidorn\n- [x] Razor @isidorn \n- [x] Ruby @bgashler1 classes are no longer colored when used (still colored when defined).  Seems to follow TypeScript's style.\n- [x] Rust @bgashler1 \n- [x] Sass @bgashler1 \n- [x] Shaderlab @bgashler1 classes are no longer colored when defined. What used to be their color is now used for types.  Both of these differences seem odd (I don't use Shaderlab currently, though).\n- [x] Shellscript @SofianHn \n- [x] Swift @SofianHn \n- [x] Tsql @SofianHn \n- [x] Typescript\n- [x] Vb @SofianHn \n- [x] Xml/Xls @gregvanl\n  The xml meta tag now has the same color as other xml tags on Dark+ and Light+. I think that's a good thing. It had been purple.\n- [x] Yaml @gregvanl Attribute value blue is brighter on Light and Light+ themes.

trying to use Code on Windows to develop a PowerShell script. I encountered some difficulties when I tried to cut and paste a Windows path into the \"args\" parameter in my launch.json file.\n1. I had to change \"\\\" to \"\\\\\" to avoid a syntax error. That's inconvenient and ugly.\n2. I haven't found a way to pass a space (blank) character embedded within a single argument.\n3. The (x86) in the path causes PowerShell to give an error: x86 : The term 'x86' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\n\nSo if my launch.json file contains:\n\n```\n        \"type\": \"PowerShell x86\",\n        \"request\": \"launch\",\n        \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}\\\\Compare.ps1\",\n        \"args\": [\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\", \"arg1a arg1b\"]\n```\n\nAnd the program is\n`Write-Output \"args:\", $args`\nThen when I run it, I get\n\n```\nx86 : The term 'x86' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the \nspelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\nAt line:1 char:48\n+ c:\\Src\\Tools\\BnA\\Compare.ps1 C:\\Program Files (x86) arg1a arg1b\n+                                                ~~~\n```\n\nOn the other hand, if I call my program from a PowerShell window, it parses the command line with two arguments just as I want:\n\n```\nPS C:\\Src\\Tools\\BnA> Compare.ps1 \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\" \"arg1a arg1b\"\nargs:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\narg1a arg1b\nPS C:\\Src\\Tools\\BnA>\n```\n\nI think there are some bugs here, but maybe also a limitation in the allowed json file syntax. Right now single quotes aren't allowed in the json file for quoting strings. Would it be possible to have single quotes be a \"stronger\" type of quote mark that avoid any sort of interpretation, string substitution, etc. as much as possible, so file paths and other sorts of strings with funny characters can be passed in to the target program without a struggle?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4056","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4056/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4056/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4056/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/4056","id":140344579,"number":4056,"title":"[themes]

As an example of what I would like to see, this could be added to the Next Steps section near the end of docs/editor/setup. (I'd recommend moving the Additional Tools section after Next Steps section):\n### Next Steps\n- Read The Basics - Basic orientation around VS Code\n- Add a debugger for your programing language (link to Debugger page)\n- Customize the launch.json and tasks.json files for your development environment and workflow. See (here) for essential information about the syntax and available parameters that can be used in these files. **<-- This documentation is badly needed by those of us who aren't familiar with JSON**.\n  - Customize launch.json to launch your application and supply command line arguments. (link)\n  - Customize launch.json and tasks.json with a preLaunchTask that can build your application before running it. (link)\n  - Customize tasks.json with a problem matcher to allow stepping through compiler errors and quickly navigating to the error locations in your source code. (link)\n  - Customize for source control (link)\n- Add an IntelliSense extension to provide \"code understanding,\" highlight syntax errors in your code, help you find definitions of code objects (variables, functions, types...), etc. (link)\n- Read Editing Evolved which introduces the features of IntelliSense.\n\n(Put the Additional Tools section here.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4052","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4052/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4052/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4052/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4052","id":140328569,"number":4052,"title":"What is the correct behavior of running Code 0.10.10 from the command line?","user":{"login":"bording","id":753669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/753669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bording","html_url":"https://github.com/bording","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bording/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bording/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bording/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bording/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bording/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bording/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bording/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bording/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bording/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2016-03-12T01:01:04Z","updated_at":"2016-03-23T17:23:10Z","closed_at":"2016-03-13T18:03:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As requested by @bpasero in #4006, I'm opening an issue on this.\n\nUsing 0.10.10, when I run Code from the command line without any options specified, it always reuses the existing window.

Windows 10\nBuild: new 0.10.12-alpha\nSteps:\n1. Install any old VS code build.\n2. Launch app to verify installation is done properly.\n3. Now close all the open instances and other program (cmd prompt) which has reference of VS code.\n4, Now install latest alpha build from : *_https://vscode-builds.azurewebsites.net/alpha *_\n5. Follow the install Wizard.\n6. Proceed with installation by closing all the active program which are causing problem in installation (Look at the attached img :InstallWizard.jpg).\n6. The installation wizard ask for replacing files and folder of the old build under : \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft VS Code Alpha\".\n7. Click on next to proceed with installation.\n8. If installation wizard unable to override files or not able to close all the references then it is giving options like: Abort, Retry or Ignore.\n9. Select ignore option and proceed with installation \n10. If you get the same pop-up again then select \"Abort\" to rollback changes.\n11. Once rollback is done try to launch previously installed app (directly from installed location or from command prompt).\n\nNote: Verify VS code installed directory under : C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft VS Code Alpha.\n\nActual: \n1. When trying to launch app from command prompt (>Code-alpha ) I could see that the two instances of the app has been created in the windows task manager but app UI is not launching.\n2. Looks like after closing all the active window some instances are left orphan in the system which is causing the issue to upgrade build.\n3. I tried closing all the orphan instances manually from task manager and then only upgrade work properly.\n\nExpected:\n1. User should be able to launch an app when new installation is rolled back successfully.\n2.
