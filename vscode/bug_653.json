Previously we would update textArea's state (including value) when there is any selection change. This means, if the selection changes in composition, the textArea state is updated in time. However for those composition that don't trigger any selection change, the textArea is out of date, which leads to some words/characters duplication.\r\n\r\nAs listed issues are talking about Japanese or Accents, here I'd like to describe the behavior with another IME.\r\n\r\n1. Switch to Chinese IME\r\n2. Type `a` and the first selection change kicks in, we update the textArea state accordingly.\r\n    ![screen shot 2016-11-28 at 3 01 15 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/876920/20689703/9d5dddb8-b57b-11e6-821f-6b6446756f87.png)\r\n3. Press `space` to choose the first word `啊`. There is no selection change, we forget to update the textArea state. \r\n![screen shot 2016-11-28 at 3 03 03 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/876920/20689847/2cbc453a-b57c-11e6-9982-3eee2df335ab.png)\r\n\r\n4. Since the textArea state is not cleaned, so next time when you press any key, let's say `enter`, the text being inserted into the editor is `啊\\n`. ![ime](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/876920/20689889/5b33db1c-b57c-11e6-9895-df1abfc3c98a.gif)\r\n\r\nFrom the code level, previously we were updating the textArea state for IE and Edge as the textarea is not cleared initially on those two browsers. Now we do the same thing for all compositionEnd operations as if there is no selection change in composition, the textArea is not cleared as well.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16186","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16186/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16186/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16186/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/16186","id":192143002,"number":16186,"title":"Extract

like a way to toggle codelens via a keyboard shortcut.\r\n\r\nIt would be very very welcome, sometimes in files where you have a lot of referenceable material packed in a small space (c# properties for instance) it's very distracting and other times it's the only way to get to things (c# debug test for instance).\r\n\r\nBeing able to toggle codelens would be the bee's knees.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oh and to add to this, being able to toggle codelens is also very nice from a responsiveness perspective as omnisharp really has a tough time serving all those \"x references\" queries. Seeing huge cpu spikes where mono.osx is at 200% for a while before dropping to normal levels again.\r\nNot a problem if you stay in 1 file but going from file to file you keep hitting the language server with quite some load.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16174/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4709","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"919E:366D:382E76:7F0B5E:59D93ED9","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=654>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=652>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"fa50d2fd831be2548f8ec3a5c2d85093\"","status":"200 OK"}}
