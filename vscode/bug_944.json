VSCode Version: 1.2.0\n- OS Version: CentOS 7 -- NodeJS app\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.  Use express-generator to create a nodejs app; it creates a bin/www file with no extension\n2.  When editing the bin/www file, with language mode as JavaScript, the require, process, etc. entries are indicated as errors.\n3.  If a .js extension is added to the bin/www file - the intellisense no longer shows the entries as errors\n\nA bit strange (at least from my perspective) as one would think that intellisense would be driven from the Language Mode not the extension, or lack thereof. \"Normal\" javascript intellisense is active BTW, it just seems to not be picking up the nodejs references.\n\nReally like VSCode, VS Community just seems \"too heavy\" for a lot of small-medium projects.\n\nThanks,\nDavid\n\n![screenshot from 2016-06-09
