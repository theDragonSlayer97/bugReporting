looks like VS Code opens `.asar` files to make them browsable in the workspace tree view. That sounds helpful, except it seems like a file handle is kept open at all times, preventing some packaging script of mine from deleting `.asar` files if I keep VS Code open when running it.\n\nWould it be possible to ensure `.asar` files are only opened by VS Code if they are being browsed explicitely in the tree view? or maybe avoid keeping the file handle open on them while idling?\n\nI'm running VS Code 0.10.2 on Windows 7 64-bit.\nThanks for a great editor!

the VS Code API tests I have a clean up function that signals that it is done when all editors are closed. Currently the solution is hacky, it needs to install a setInterval to periodically check on the `vscode.window.visibleTextEditors` property to eventually become 0 (see https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/vscode-api-tests/src/utils.ts#L52).\n\nThe issue is that the `window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor` event is not good enough for testing on the visible text editors as shown by the following test:\n\n```\ntest('visibleTextEditors', () => {\n    return workspace.openTextDocument(join(workspace.rootPath, './far.js')).then(doc => {\n        return window.showTextDocument(doc).then((editor) => {\n            return new Promise((c, e) => {\n                const listener = window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor(d => {\n                    console.log('editor is null?: ' + !d);\n                    if (window.visibleTextEditors.length > 0) {\n                        console.log('visibleTextEditors count is: ' + window.visibleTextEditors.length);\n                        return;\n                    }\n\n                    listener.dispose();\n                    c();\n                });\n\n                commands.executeCommand('workbench.action.closeAllEditors').then(null, e);\n            });\n        });\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThe value passed in from the event is null as expected because I am running the close all editors action. However, `window.visibleTextEditors.length` is still 1 at that point.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/642","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/642/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/642/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/642/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/642","id":118897098,"number":642,"title":"Version 0.9 and higher is super slow while opening editor, project or files","user":{"login":"wUFr","id":10975377,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10975377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wUFr","html_url":"https://github.com/wUFr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wUFr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wUFr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wUFr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wUFr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wUFr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wUFr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wUFr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wUFr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wUFr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":291057332,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/verified","name":"verified","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/10","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/10","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/10/labels","id":1431212,"number":10,"title":"Nov 2015 -
