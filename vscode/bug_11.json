This competes with `iconClass` and having both doesn't make much sense. While I understand the reasoning for us having it `iconPath` is only honoured in a single place and every other user will fail to make it work. At least the `MenuItemActionItem` should know what to do, ideally no competing concepts exist.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35490","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35490/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35490/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35490/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35490","id":262099346,"number":35490,"title":"debt -

seeing a very strange issue with a couple of GitLens users (I have one user with the issue right now and we have tried to debug it). What looks like is happening is that the `globalState` that I set in GitLens is somehow being either cleared or set to a previous value on every restart of vscode.\r\n\r\nFor example, I use `context.globalState.get<string>('gitlensVersion')` to detect upgrades which I log to the output channel. In this user's case,  when it gets logged out it seems to have a value of `5.1.1-beta`, but when we look in the local storage -- that global gitlens key has a value of `5.3.0`, and if we restart vscode, we see exactly the same thing, it gets read/logged as `5.1.1-beta`, but we see it as `5.3.0` in local storage. We've pulled down the gitlens repo and tried to catch this in the debugger, but when in the debugger we never see the wrong value -- it always gets correctly read as `5.3.0`. I will also say if other keys get written to the same `globalState` -- we can see them properly in the local storage, but once we restart vscode they all disappear.\r\n\r\nFYI, this user did have the marketplace version of GitLens installed on top of a previous beta vsix, but we removed all the versions and re-installed GitLens from scratch and still the behavior persists.\r\n\r\nThis users was on Linux, but I've had another case of almost the same behavior on macOS (https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens/issues/130)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35486","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35486/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35486/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35486/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35486","id":262068356,"number":35486,"title":"PowerShell ext and VMware.PowerCLI vis mount name is already in use","user":{"login":"agowa338","id":2544867,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2544867?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agowa338","html_url":"https://github.com/agowa338","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agowa338/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agowa338/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agowa338/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agowa338/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agowa338/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agowa338/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agowa338/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agowa338/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agowa338/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":409283388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/caused-by-extension","name":"caused-by-extension","color":"E2A1C2","default":false},{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-10-02T12:27:56Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T16:54:50Z","closed_at":"2017-10-02T16:54:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## Details\r\n- VSCode Version: Code 1.16.1 (27492b6bf3acb0775d82d2f87b25a93490673c6d, 2017-09-14T16:38:23.027Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT x64 6.2.9200\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n## Extensions\r\nExtension|Author (truncated)|Version\r\n---|---|---\r\nvscode-eslint|dba|1.3.2\r\nansible-vault|dho|0.0.9\r\npython|don|0.7.0\r\nansible|haa|0.2.5\r\nterraform|mau|0.0.18\r\nPowerShell|ms-|1.4.3\r\nvim|vsc|0.10.1\r\njinja|who|0.0.8\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1.
