This test plan will take a fair bit of time to get through.\n#### Operating Systems\n- [x] Windows - @chrmarti\n- [x] Mac @isidorn \n- [x] Linux - @kieferrm\n#### What's new?\n\n_A lot_ of stuff changed in the terminal, many bugs were fixed, some big features landed like multiple terminals and the ability to consistently copy and paste (currently bound to <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>ins</kbd> to copy, <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>ins</kbd> to paste), the underlying library that powers the terminal was swapped out for a more mature one ([xterm.js](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js)) and there was a big refactor to support all these changes. CJK character width was also fixed so they should no longer have random sizing and/or wrap and break the row count of the terminal.\n\nA full list of the changes can be seen [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aintegrated-terminal+milestone%3A%22June+2016%22+is%3Aclosed).\n#### What to test?\n\nHere is a mostly complete list of test cases around features that were added, fixed or impacted greatly by the refactor and xterm.js adoption:\n- Adding multiple terminals (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+`backtick`, removing various indexes (first, last, middle)\n- Using a non-standard shell\n- Using `exit` to kill the shell\n- Using copy <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>ins</kbd> and paste <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>ins</kbd>\n- Using middle click to paste selection on Linux\n- Try building and running vscode through the integrated terminal (`./scripts/code.sh`)\n- CJK and general unicode characters can be input and viewed in the terminal. note that you cannot use an IME currently sourcelair/xterm.js#124 (the varying height of unicode characters is a known issue #8219)\n- Resizing:\n  - Vertically & horizontally\n  - With and without a program running\n  - With little output\n- Scrolling:\n  - <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+arrow (or mac equivalent)\n  - <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+page up/down (or mac equivalent)\n  - Mouse or trackpad (reports of trackpad scroll not working on mac #7817)\n- Using the new settings (they should apply without needing a window reload):\n  - Add args when spawning a new shell: `terminal.integrated.shellArgs.<platform>`\n  - Change font family: `terminal.integrated.fontSize`\n  - Change line height: `terminal.integrated.lineHeight`\n- Using the new commands:\n  - `workbench.action.terminal.focus`\n  - `workbench.action.terminal.focusNext`\n  - `workbench.action.terminal.focusPrevious`\n  - `workbench.action.terminal.kill`\n  - Disable cursor blinking: `editor.cursorBlinking`\n  - Run the editor selection in the terminal: `workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText`\n- Adjusting font size and line height\n- Text foreground and background color is inverted on selection like in `gnome-terminal`\n- The new \"hollow\" cursor when the terminal does not have focus\n- Ensure vim no longer overrides the terminal color set #6457\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8222/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8221","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8221/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8221/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8221/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8221","id":162540978,"number":8221,"title":"Update
