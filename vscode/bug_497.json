branches / undo tree allows you to undo some changes,\r\nthen make a new change, while keeping all changes available in the undo tree.\r\nThe undo tree can therefore prevent awkward scenarios such as:\r\n * Losing all redo futures by accidentally pressing a button during undo\r\n * Copying the file or save it with git when trying multiple alternatives\r\n\r\nThis screen-cap showcases how it works in Emacs with undo-tree.\r\n\r\n![wpid-undo-tree1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/908496/23103901/811d0352-f6c3-11e6-8dfa-b8690faa034f.gif)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Zalastax/vscode/commit/c5699711d21dece88c7c608f6d8ae277f72a0081 contains the changes to the model that are needed, but several questions remain to be answered. I'm interested in completing the feature but need further input before proceeding.\r\n* How should the UI look? Graphics / ASCII, clickable?\r\n* Should the tree be formatted like in Emacs undo-tree (as short tree as possible) or like Vim's Gundo http://screenr.com/M9l (one state per line sorted by time)?\r\n* What unit-tests should be added?\r\n\r\nYou can try out the current changes by compiling my fork and you'll find 'History Tree' in the Edit menu. Clicking the menu item will console.log a function that changes what redo future is selected (just like in the gif).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20889/reactions","total_count":30,"+1":21,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":5,"confused":0,"heart":4}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20888","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20888/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20888/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20888/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20888","id":208716826,"number":20888,"title":"Command

VSCode Version: **1.9.1**\r\n- OS Version: **Windows 10 Pro x64 v1607**\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n1. Open VS Code, then create a new file [Ctrl + N]\r\n2. Copy & Paste some sample codes.\r\n3. Try to rename a symbol by using F2 / \"Rename Symbol\" feature.\r\n\r\n**Expected:** we can quickly rename the symbol in the current tab / file.\r\n**Actual:** See a warning _\"File not found (\\untitled:Untitled-1)\"_\r\n\r\n**User Story:**\r\nI was so glad to know that [Hot Exit feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_8#_hot-exit) has been added to VS Code since version 1.8.1 (I like this feature since the last time with Sublime Text). I usually write some codes in draft mode and throw them after done. Ex: playground, solving coding challenges. Although I will throw them away, I still want to refactor them while coding and make the code easier to read. So, I hope the intelligent of \"Rename Symbol\" feature would be improved soon.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** After sent this issue, I suddenly realize that I could save a playground file on my Desktop to support my use cases. However, it still depends on VS Code Team's decision to improve this feature or not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20872/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20871","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20871/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20871/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20871/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20871","id":208688981,"number":20871,"title":"ERROR: Unable to start debugging.

about FTP.\r\nI think we need decision, that:\r\n\r\n1.  main VSC developers **want support this feature or not** and leave this for:\r\n2.  external extensions which exist or can be developed other (maybe bether than exist)\r\n3.  external extensions as own support to solve basic problem what exist in point 2\r\n\r\n- [ ] We need **FTP manager as global list of ftp accounts** (should not be as dedicated config.json for main project, easy to disclose secret access data to the servers [login/pass]) \r\n- [ ] should work similiar as **FTP Explorer** but on remote server \r\n- [ ] Search, Listing dirs and files\r\n- [ ] **CHMOD** edit options + automaticly add default CHMOD for some files/dir (if edit or created) if need (eg. execute for .py - very often issue on ftp clients - that after upload/changes we must manulay change CHMOD to set execute mode for file)\r\n- [ ] Can be as next icon \"qFTP\" (Quick FTP [ctr+shift+q]) under \"Extensions\" icon\r\n- [ ] some backup/tmp philosophy for files (including undo, redo) if saved files in live mode was was done with mistake\r\n- [ ] Sync (exist plugins but this is far from all **Qucik FTP Explorer** )\r\n\r\n4. I know about\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18186\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13643\r\n\r\n5.
