Example: \n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6598594/13711788/465be926-e775-11e5-9f34-af5e62f1e362.png)\n\nIn [this file](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/debug/electron-browser/debugService.ts#L238), I found that when the debugger receives a stopping event, it is hard coded to set the 0th frame as the current frame:\n\n``` ts\nthis.setFocusedStackFrameAndEvaluate(callStack[0]);\nthis.openOrRevealEditor(callStack[0].source, callStack[0].lineNumber, false, false).done(null, errors.onUnexpectedError);\n```\n\nPrior to calling `setFocusedStackFrameAndEvaluate` or `openOrRevealEditor`, the debugService should walk it's callstack looking for a frame that has valid source information. The first frame it finds should be passed to `setFocusedStackFrameAndEvaluate` and `openOrRevealEditor`.\n\nAdditionally: I found that if a debugAdapter does not provide source information for a frame, VS Code creates a default Source object for the stack frame:\n\n``` ts\nreturn new StackFrame(data.threadId, rsf.id, rsf.source ? new Source(rsf.source) : new Source({ name: 'unknown' }), rsf.name, rsf.line, rsf.column);\n```\n\nThis issue is that a default Source objects sets source available to true:\n\n``` ts\n    constructor(public raw: DebugProtocol.Source) {\n        this.uri = raw.path ? uri.file(raw.path) : uri.parse(Source.INTERNAL_URI_PREFIX + raw.name);\n        this.available = true;\n    }\n```\n\nI believe that if a debugAdapter does not provide source for a frame, VS Code should not mark a stack frame as having source available.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4026","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4026/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4026/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4026/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4026","id":140260342,"number":4026,"title":"Debug

closed out the last issue I had open for this, without a proper answer, so I'm creating a new one.\n\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3968\n\n> There's options for View: Focus into Side Bar and View: Focus on Working Files, but there isn't any option for View: Focus into Open Project. Please add this.\n\n<img width=\"425\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-03-10 at 9 33 58 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/466713/13676522/6a4932c6-e6a3-11e5-9f89-0c9855675ac9.png\">\n\nThe \"answer\" that was authoritatively posted into that thread, only works if focus was not previously set to the _Working Files_ section of the Side Bar. If _Working Files_ was the last \"area\" to have focus in the Side Bar, before focus was moved away, then the `CMD + SHIFT + E` shortcut will simply return it to _Working Files_ instead of the project.\n\n**SIDE NOTE**: I'd recommend allowing people some time to respond, before closing out their GitHub issues. People who don't administer the GitHub project **cannot** re-open their issues, if they're closed out by a project member. Recently, I've been quite diligent about following up on tickets that I've reported, so I'd appreciate an opportunity to hash things out fully, instead of assumptions being made. The Visual Studio Code team has been doing some very good work; it's my hope that this continues.\n\nCheers,\nTrevor Sullivan\nMicrosoft MVP: PowerShell\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4942","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507415105","x-github-request-id":"C484:3670:AC4708:1BCD311:59D94735","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1059>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1057>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d997232de1d1d3699534c16e532334dd\"","status":"200 OK"}}
