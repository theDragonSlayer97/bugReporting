Use Help > Report Issues to prefill these. -->\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.15.1\r\n- OS Version: Linux Mint 18 (based on Ubuntu 16.04)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Set the `editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter` option to `off`.\r\n1. Open an existing file so that the suggestions list has several words to populate it.\r\n1. While the suggestions list is up for a word, press Enter to start a new line *without* accepting the suggestion.\r\n1. Hit Backspace twice, to delete the newline and the last character of the previous word.\r\n1. Type one more character, which triggers the suggestions list.\r\n\r\nResult: the suggestions list is shifted horizontally quite far right of where it should be. See screenshots below.\r\n\r\nBefore pressing Enter:\r\n\r\n![Before pressing Enter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90762/29854239-db62bdd8-8d6e-11e7-8dde-9ce13db9fc1a.png)\r\n\r\nAfter pressing Enter, then Backspace twice, then typing the letter `e`:\r\n\r\n![After backspace twice plus another letter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90762/29854264-01948f90-8d6f-11e7-96dd-39f5e04f757b.png)\r\n\r\nNote that I had trouble reproducing this when in a new file, but I could consistently reproduce it in a file that had quite a lot of text in it. Also, timing seems to be involved: if I waited a while between backspacing and typing the new character, the suggestions list appeared in the right place. Only when the two backspaces were quickly followed by typing `e` did the suggestions list show up in the wrong place horizontally — but when I typed those keystrokes at my normal typing speed (fairly quickly), the suggestions list consistently went too far to the right.\r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions:

downgrade the overall UX. Because all of these issues are quite often met, even in a normal day-to-day usage, when coding Python.\r\n\r\nAs a comparison, most of those issues do not exist --- to any little bit of extent--- in any other editor I`ve used or currently using (Atom, Sublime Text, Vim, etc.).\r\n\r\nIt really makes me wonder if or not I should trust vscode for developing python code, or even continue using vscode as my main editor...

Check out the code <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45949692/tslint-json-is-not-working-in-vs-code\">on SO</a>\r\n\r\nI have a completely valid `tslint.json` and `tsconfig.json`. When I run my lint script, `\"lint\": \"tslint ./src/**/*.ts --exclude \\\"./**/node_modules/**/*.ts\\\"\"`, I do get output from my Terminal. But VS Code doesn't highlight or underline any issues. It does not work with or without the extension. I've force-quit several times. I've restarted my computer. I grabbed someone else's tsconfig and tslint from a public repo, with no luck. I even cloned a reputable repo and still get no linting. (<a href=\"https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server\">apollographql/apollo-server</a>). So, not really knowing what to do, here I am, hopeful to get some help.

the attribute `styleName` from https://github.com/gajus/babel-plugin-react-css-modules. It uses `styleName` instead of `className` to reference styles.\r\n\r\nFirst, I tried creating an Emmet snippet `[st]: \"styleName\"` and typing `div[st]` followed by Tab to see if worked. It didn't, the result was `<div st=\"\"></div>`.\r\n\r\nI think the easiest solution would be to change the file `jsx.js` in https://github.com/emmetio/emmet/blob/master/lib/filter/jsx.js. `className` would become `styleName`. Not the best solution since I would lose the `className` attribute instead of having an alternative.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to change this file?
