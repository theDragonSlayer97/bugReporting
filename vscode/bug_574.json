Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.8.1\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.12.2\r\n\r\nI recognize that I'm in \"special snowflake\" territory with my setup here, and definitely don't expect first-class support for what I'm doing, but it feels like the kind of thing VS Code could handle more gracefully than it currently does. Basically this is a stranger occurrence of #10571. \r\n\r\nThe [zsh port of nvm](https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-nvm) has a side effect of slowing down shell startups; to mitigate this, it has a lazy loading functionality that has node, npm, and any other installed binaries defined as functions at shell startup. On first invocation, they load up Node properly and everything proceeds hunky dory. (Thus you only incur the delay when you're actually using Node.) \r\n\r\nThis seems to be interfering with VS Code's ability to figure out the environment -- I'm guessing that when it loads a fresh shell at startup and pulls its environment, the function definitions don't play a role (nor should they). \r\n\r\nIf I start code from a command line where the lazy loading has already been done, the debugger works fine. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install zsh and the [zsh port of nvm](https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-nvm). Make them your default shell.\r\n2. In your .zshrc, `export NVM_LAZY_LOAD=true` before `source`-ing `zsh-nvm/zsh-nvm.plugin.zsh`.\r\n3. Try to debug a Node.js project in VS Code. \r\n4. Note \"Cannot find runtime 'node' on PATH\" error.\r\n5. Close down VS Code, open a terminal, and run `node -v`. Then invoke `code` on a directory containing a Node.js project. \r\n6. Note that you can successfully debug this project.\r\n6. Close down VS Code, remove the NVM_LAZY_LOAD export from .zshrc, and restart VS Code.\r\n7. Note that the debugger now can find Node. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18556/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18555","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18555/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18555/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18555/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18555","id":200828890,"number":18555,"title":"Reporting potential vulnerability","user":{"login":"abauzac","id":3852008,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3852008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abauzac","html_url":"https://github.com/abauzac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abauzac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abauzac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abauzac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abauzac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abauzac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abauzac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abauzac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abauzac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abauzac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-14T20:50:46Z","updated_at":"2017-01-15T10:51:45Z","closed_at":"2017-01-15T10:51:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello, I would like to report a potential vulnerability in VSCode...\r\nCopying some malicious code in the editor seems to auto execute it. \r\nCopying the EICAR test payload works as expected, but copying specific code has triggered Windows Defender immediately so I guessed it's a bug. \r\n\r\nCan I send the (plain) code privately to a maintainer ?\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.8.1\r\n- OS Version: Win10 Home 64\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
