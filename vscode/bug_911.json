`<li>` when the cursor is at the end, I believe this is how general bracket matching works in vscode. For emmet the 'current' selected tag is actually the `<a>` as revealed when using the go to matching pair function:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2193314/16432388/93fd78ba-3d39-11e6-9abf-70774ed68667.png)\n\nThe bracket matching in particular make this jump quite confusing. While I don't advocate designing around how Emmet works, this issue could be resolved by bringing the HTML/XML \"matching pair\" functionality in vscode to work when the cursor is _outside_ the tag. Currently you need to focus the `li`:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2193314/16432428/cc9bf1c4-3d39-11e6-8780-cccca42d2f44.png)\n\nThis is what I want when the cursor is adjacent to a tag:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2193314/16432506/286a7ab6-3d3a-11e6-803e-e80318a88970.png)\n\nIdeally this matching would be the same as emmet in that when the cursor is in the middle of two tags not separated by whitespace, the tag after the cursor is highlighted.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8442","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8442/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8442/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8442/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8442","id":162788045,"number":8442,"title":"Symbol renames get very slow and sometimes fail/timeout","user":{"login":"brentwa","id":5667500,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5667500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentwa","html_url":"https://github.com/brentwa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentwa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentwa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentwa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentwa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentwa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentwa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentwa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentwa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentwa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-28T21:09:13Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T05:08:36Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T05:08:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.2.1\n- OS Version: OSX 10.11.5 (El Capitan)\n\nThis is while editing Unity CSharp scripts.

Repeat step #1 a few times (1-3).\n\nAfter pressing <enter> on the rename prompt, there is a pause before the code changes.  The pause seems to get longer after each rename.

VSCode Version: Version 1.3.0-insider (1.3.0-insider) d0c2b891903d73e83dcdc7786398ebfa764fc4ee\n- OS Version: OSX 10.11.5\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open VSCode insider from Finder (not from terminal)\n2. Try to run build task (that is using tsc -w)\n3. I'm using nvm so proper PATH needs to be set eg . `~/.nvm/...`\n\nThis is similar to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7343 or even identical. Commit https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commit/1a7c54e2678107a72f8546fb9319ff2f6dd1487d does not fix this issue for me.\n\nWhen I start VSCode from Finder and open devtools then `process.env.PATH == \"/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\"`. When I start VSCode from terminal then it has my proper `process.env.PATH == \"/Users/wallverb/.nvm/versions/node/v4.2.2/bin:/opt/local/bin:..........\"`\n\nWhen I run this code in devtools:\n\n``` js\nconst electron = \"/Applications/Visual Studio Code - Insiders.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron\";\nconst cp = require('child_process');\nconst env = Object.assign({}, process.env, {\n    ATOM_SHELL_INTERNAL_RUN_AS_NODE: '1',\n    ELECTRON_NO_ATTACH_CONSOLE: '1'\n});\nconst command = `'${electron}' -p 'JSON.stringify(process.env)'`;\nconst result = cp.spawnSync(process.env.SHELL, ['-ilc', command], {\n    detached: true,\n    stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', process.stderr],\n    env,\n    encoding: 'utf8'\n});\nconsole.log(result.stdout.match(/\"PATH\":\"(.*?)\"/)[1])\n\n// const strip = s => s.replace(/[\\u001b\\u009b][[()#;?]*(?:[0-9]{1,4}(?:;[0-9]{0,4})*)?[0-9A-ORZcf-nqry=><]/g, '').replace(/\\u001b\\].*?\\u0007/g, '');\n//console.log(JSON.parse(result.stdout));  // would throw parse error\n```\n\nThen proper path is returned : `\"/Users/wallverb/.nvm/versions/node/v4.2.2/bin:/opt/local/bin:..........\"`\n\nbut the problem is that my interactive shell returns some \"intro message\" (eg. `zsh -ilc env` will return `INTRO_MESSAGE\\nwalverb` which will of course break `JSON.parse()` in above code. I wonder why is 1.2.0 working fine and it's only problem with 1.3.0-insider\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8434/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8433","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8433/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8433/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8433/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8433","id":162777538,"number":8433,"title":"Debugger stalls trying to inspect XDocument variable","user":{"login":"iRonJ","id":6108031,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6108031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRonJ","html_url":"https://github.com/iRonJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRonJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRonJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRonJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRonJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRonJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRonJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRonJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRonJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRonJ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-28T20:20:17Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T05:06:53Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T05:06:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Version 1.2.1 (1.2.1)\n- OS Version: 10.11.5 (15F34)\n- dotnet --version: 1.0.0-preview2-003121\n  Steps to Reproduce:\n1.

It simply looks for them in workspaceRoot.\n  - it's however, able to find `tsconfig.json` without a problem.\n- I've defined tasks like `npm run build` `npm run lint` in my sub projects. They are just simple shortcuts to tslint or eslint and tsc or webpack. When I create `npm` tasks in `tasks.json`, vscode is unable to detect the package.json file.\n  - I can fix this by using `options.cwd = '${cwd}/app/'` but then vscode is unable to match the errors to the correct files. vscode runs the commands from workspaceRoot, but npm's output is relative to the project.\n  - I cannot use `problemMatcher.fileLocation` to fix this issue because `global matchers and tasks can't be mixed. Ignoring global matchers.`\n\nExpected:\n- when running tasks, vscode should look for configs and binaries relative to open file location, unless configured other vise.\n- when linting, vscode should look for configs relative to open file location.\n\nThis setup works without a problem on Sublime Text and Atom.\n\nHope this helps, let me know if I can provide more information.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8430","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8430/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8430/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8430/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8430","id":162761663,"number":8430,"title":"Support real Integration/UI Tests","user":{"login":"jsloyer","id":154126,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/154126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer","html_url":"https://github.com/jsloyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-06-28T19:04:42Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T14:39:38Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I was looking into the extension `vscode-api-tests`, this seems to be a very limited integration test suite for vscode.
