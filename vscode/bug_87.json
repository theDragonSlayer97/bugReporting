VSCode Version: 1.15.1\r\n- OS Version: OS X 10.12.6\r\n\r\nSince the release of Emmet 2.0, my custom snippets no longer work. As a pared down example:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"xml\": {\r\n\t\t\"snippets\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"xml\": \"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"UTF-8\\\"?>\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the above, the snippet doesn't work. It worked perfectly alongside many others pre Emmet 2.0.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install the custom emmet `snippets.json` file, and declare that folder location in the settings\r\n2. Set new file language to xml.\r\n3. Use snippet `xml`, nothing happens.\r\n4. Set Emmet to use tab for auto completion.\r\n5. Use snippet `xml` and press tab, nothing happens.\r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\nThe release of Emmet 2.0 has severely ruined my productivity and my opinion is that the changes implemented were a very bad idea without much more user feedback.
