Take the following CSS code:\r\n```css\r\npaper-item {\r\n\t height: 10px;\r\n\t color: var(--komed-font-color-blue);\r\n\t/*border: solid;*/\r\n\t/*border-width: 1px;*/\r\n\t margin-left: 3%;\r\n\t font-size: 14px;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. If I toggle line comment now on line 3 to 6 (select the lines and press the command shortcut for line comment)\r\n3. Then the comments actually break because there already was some comments\r\n```\r\npaper-item {\r\n\t height: 10px;\r\n\t color: var(--komed-font-color-blue);\r\n\tborder: solid;*/\r\n\t/*border-width: 1px;\r\n\t margin-left: 3%;\r\n\t font-size: 14px;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis only happens to file extensions where there is no actual \"line comment\". So CSS for example or HTML. For a JS file the editor fills in the appropriate amount of `//` comments","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27560/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27559","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27559/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27559/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27559/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27559","id":232256645,"number":27559,"title":"Stopping the debug session is not stopping the node server running in docker","user":{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-30T13:40:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T12:32:58Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Testing #27462\r\n\r\n- Follow the steps in recipe [\"Debugging Docker with Source maps\"](https://github.com/weinand/vscode-recipes/tree/master/Docker-TypeScript):\r\n- Launch the node in Docker using debug configuration `Launch in Docker`\r\n- Server starts and everything is good\r\n- Stop the debug session\r\n\r\nExpected to stop the node server in Docker.

Behavior\r\n\r\nUse the single, stationary \"...\" button to house all dynamic buttons, searches, and files without changing the \"Tabs\" width and size. \r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nToo many buttons disappear and reappear depending on what has focus.\r\n\r\nThis creates a jarring experience with multiple files open in each pane.\r\n\r\nIf focused on the RIGHT pane, and clicking on the LEFT Pane, the Tabs all shift and squish to the left to make room for the buttons.\r\n\r\nThey should instead be listed under the \"...\" button, because they are infrequently used.\r\n\r\n##

To not break to many users we need to address this. I see the following options:\r\n\r\n1. we make the annotation more explicit with a taskAnnotation section.\r\n2. we make the annotation algorithm more complex. A task only annotates if a extension really contributes a task with the same name or id. If no such task exists we try to treat it as a 0.1.0 task definition.\r\n3. We officially support a runner attribute: The following combination would be valid:\r\n`version: 0.1.0` & (`runner: output` | `runner: terminal`) and `version: 2.0.0` & `runner: terminal`). This allows users to use the terminal runner with the old syntax. The 2.0.0 syntax will can be breaking (for example no global task definition, ...) and is only supported with the terminal runner.\r\n\r\n@egamma any preferences. I personally would opt for 3 (you suggested this for a different reason end of last week. Should have listened :-)) and then 2. 3 would give us the most flexibility in the future.
