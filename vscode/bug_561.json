Set keyboard layout (thorugh Ubuntu) to Italian - this is the standard setup of mine, since keyboard layout is Italian.\r\n\r\n2. Go to File -> Preferences -> Keyboard shortcuts, and look for i.e. \"Toggle new terminal\" (that is Ctrl+` for US layout and Crtl+\\ for Italian layout - they are on the same physical key, so I assume this is the rationale).\r\n\r\n3. Execute the shortcut and (a) nothing happens or worse (b) something different from expected happens.\r\n\r\n4. Set keyboard layout (thorugh Ubuntu) EN-US (it might work, sure, but it takes a bit, making it useless to use shortcuts)\r\n\r\n5. The command works, if the Italian-keyboard key combination is pressed.\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge and limited testing, this is the only way to make some shortcuts work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18948","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18948/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18948/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18948/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/18948","id":202245299,"number":18948,"title":"Fix markdown view sync for frontmatter","user":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-01-20T21:21:31Z","updated_at":"2017-01-20T21:22:42Z","closed_at":"2017-01-20T21:22:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/pulls/18948","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/18948","diff_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/18948.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/18948.patch"},"body":"Fixes #18946\r\n\r\n**Bug**\r\nThe markdown preview and editor syncronization is currently thrown off by yaml frontmatter.
