PR fixes 2 problems with the focus handling of the integrated terminal (see #15103 and #14969) .  \r\n\r\nAlthough they result in a  same usability/keybinding problem I initially described in #15103, my description was a little fuzzy because I didn't understand the cause fully. \r\n\r\nThere are currently 2 problems:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Problem Nr. 1**\r\n\r\nWhenever a second (or third, …) terminal instance gets exited via the shell command `exit` or by pressing `ctrl-d` (which basically is \"exit\" because it sends EOF), the terminal panel loses focus and the editor gets focus.\r\n\r\nThis hinders the workflow when working with multiple terminals, because you can't close a second one without refocusing the panel again, worst case scenario would be that a user write `exit` into an editor window without being aware of it.\r\n\r\nThe only case where focus has to change is if there is only 1 instance left, in this case the panel closes itself so the user has a visual clue about whats going on.\r\n\r\nJust in case anyone asks, the reasoning I used [focus(true)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/19f86525f2b1fc7d87f0ad6b26c3c6524336f807/src/vs/workbench/parts/terminal/electron-browser/terminalService.ts#L131) in [setActiveInstanceByIndex()](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/19f86525f2b1fc7d87f0ad6b26c3c6524336f807/src/vs/workbench/parts/terminal/electron-browser/terminalService.ts#L125) instead of inside [_removeInstance()](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/19f86525f2b1fc7d87f0ad6b26c3c6524336f807/src/vs/workbench/parts/terminal/electron-browser/terminalService.ts#L99) just in case there are some edge cases I didn't stumble upon yet. I'd guess you always want to focus your active instances, but correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Problem Nr. 2**\r\n\r\nTo make the terminal work with various keyboard shortcuts, the setting `terminal.integrated.commandsToSkipShell` was introduced. The first part of my Issue I described in #15103 and I later found out to be described in #14969 as well is caused by the following:\r\n\r\nCurrently, the settings are only handled in the panel itself when [_updateCommandsToSkipShell()](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/19f86525f2b1fc7d87f0ad6b26c3c6524336f807/src/vs/workbench/parts/terminal/electron-browser/terminalPanel.ts#L263) is called (whenever the panel gets opened). If you create a new instance with either the `+`-Button in the GUI or via a shortcut, a new terminal instance get's created, gets attached – but [_skipTerminalKeybindings](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/19f86525f2b1fc7d87f0ad6b26c3c6524336f807/src/vs/workbench/parts/terminal/electron-browser/terminalInstance.ts#L122) is empty.\r\n\r\nCalling the function to skip the commands from inside [TerminalService#createInstance()](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/19f86525f2b1fc7d87f0ad6b26c3c6524336f807/src/vs/workbench/parts/terminal/electron-browser/terminalService.ts#L62) made most sense to me because it's already aware of the settings, but correct me again if I'm wrong with this assumption.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15957","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15957/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15957/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15957/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15957","id":191265165,"number":15957,"title":"Highlighting a row of '*'","user":{"login":"danecek099","id":23700467,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/23700467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danecek099","html_url":"https://github.com/danecek099","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danecek099/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danecek099/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danecek099/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danecek099/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danecek099/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danecek099/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danecek099/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danecek099/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danecek099/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-11-23T13:03:44Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T11:04:48Z","closed_at":"2016-11-30T11:04:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.7.1 (02611b40b24c9df2726ad8b33f5ef5f67ac30b44, 2016-11-03T13:53:14.822Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\r\n\r\nWhen you type a row of stars, like this \"*************************************\", and then you highlight it with cursor, it makes some weird shadows and stuff...
