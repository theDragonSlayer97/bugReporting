Studio Code is a fantastic tool and I am really impressed by all its features despite being quite young.\n\nThere is a feature that does not still exists in VS Code which could be really convenient when we are forced to deal with big inheritance hierarchies.\n\nThis proposal is based on the TypeScript language, but I am quite sure this could apply to other OOP languages VS Code supports.\n## Overview of the Workflow\n\nLet us assume we have a source file _animal.ts_ like this:\n\n``` ts\n// animal.ts\n\nabstract class Animal {\n    private dna: number;\n    name: string;\n\n    constructor(name: string) {\n        this.dna = Math.random();\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    abstract shout(): string;\n}\n```\n\nThis file could be open or not in VS Code, but it is part of the current project.\n\nLet us assume we have another source file _bird.ts_ like this:\n\n``` ts\n// bird.ts\n\nclass Bird extends Animal {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.name = \"Hector\";\n    }\n    shout(): string {\n        return \"Cuicui!\"; // sorry it is in French... I do not know how a bird shouts in English ^_^\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis file is open in VS Code.\n\nWhat I would like to be able to do in VS Code is displaying all properties, inherited or not, available for the class `Bird`.\n\nTo do so, we could move the cursor on the `Bird` identifier, press F1 key, and run a new _Display all inherited properties_ command.\n\nThis new command would open a new file in a new tab called _Bird (all inherited properties)_.\n\nIn this example, the content of this file would be the following:\n\n```\nclass Bird {\n    private dna: number;\n    name: string;\n\n    super.constructor(name: string) {\n        this.dna = Math.random();\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.name = \"Hector\";\n    }\n\n    shout(): string {\n        return \"Cuicui!\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe content of _Bird (all inherited properties)_ has nothing to do with valid syntax. Its purpose is only informational.\n## Some informal rules\n- Attributes should be displayed first.\n- Type anotations should be rendered unchanged.\n- Access modifiers `public`, `protected`, `private` should be rendered unchanged.\n- Abstract methods which are not overriden should be rendered.\n- All versions of an overriden method should be rendered, with a concatenation of `super` prefixes to distinguish each version in the inheritance hierarchy. For instance `super.method()` would refer to immediate `method()`'s parent, whereas `super.super.method()` would refer to `method()`'s grand-parent, and so on.\n- `Method()`'s parent should be displayed before the `method()` itself.\n- The same rules for `method()` apply to `constructor()`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11526/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11525","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11525/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11525/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11525/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11525","id":174964104,"number":11525,"title":"Can't scroll on Terminal output","user":{"login":"kube","id":2991143,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2991143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kube","html_url":"https://github.com/kube","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kube/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kube/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kube/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kube/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kube/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kube/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kube/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kube/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kube/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-09-04T18:58:34Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T18:41:08Z","closed_at":"2016-09-06T18:40:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: macOS Sierra Beta 7 (But should do the same on any macOS/OS X version)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
