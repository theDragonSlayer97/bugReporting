VSCode Version: 1.11.0-insider (Commit d489c30378579fc4980d5bc272c7eb65a7c576ab)\r\n- OS Version: Windows Server 2008 R2\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Visual Studio Code\r\n2. Select File -> Preferences -> File Icon Theme\r\n3. Select \"Minimal (Visual Studio Code)\"\r\n\r\nThe space for the icons is now present but the icons itself are missing. The debug console shows the following error messages:\r\n```\r\n/C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)Microsoft%20VS%20Code%20Insidersresourcespp%0Extensionstheme-defaults%0Fileiconsimagesocument_16x.svg:1 GET file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)Microsoft%20VS%20Code%20Insidersresourcespp%0Extensionstheme-defaults%0Fileiconsimagesocument_16x.svg net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND\r\n/C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)Microsoft%20VS%20Code%20Insidersresourcespp%0Extensionstheme-defaults%0Fileiconsimages%0FolderOpen_16x.svg:1 GET file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)Microsoft%20VS%20Code%20Insidersresourcespp%0Extensionstheme-defaults%0Fileiconsimages%0FolderOpen_16x.svg net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND\r\n/C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)Microsoft%20VS%20Code%20Insidersresourcespp%0Extensionstheme-defaults%0Fileiconsimages%0Folder_16x.svg:1 GET file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)Microsoft%20VS%20Code%20Insidersresourcespp%0Extensionstheme-defaults%0Fileiconsimages%0Folder_16x.svg net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is not limited to the built-in icon set but also occurs when using a different plugin for icons (in my case, [https://github.com/hellopao/vscode-seti-icons.git](seti-icons)). The files are located in the given folders, albeit the mentioned folders above are not completly correct (I am not sure if that is the real issue or if there is some problem with the console output). The issue is also not caused by an extension as running VS code using the `code-insiders --disable-extensions` command yields the same result.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23346/reactions","total_count":18,"+1":18,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23345","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23345/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23345/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23345/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23345","id":217487273,"number":23345,"title":"Why
