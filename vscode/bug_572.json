an extension to supply multiple, *named*, keybinding contributions to correspond with the active keymap. E.g. if an extension contributes keybindings for \"vim\" (or \"emacs\"), then they should be enabled when the user selects a vim (resp. emacs) keymap. And also allow the user to manually specify the name of a keybinding contribution to activate, or `none`, per extension in settings.json. Keymap name `\"vscode\"` should be reserved for vscode's default keybindings, and an extension may optionally provide a default keybinding contribution to activate for all other keymaps.\r\n\r\nThis feature request is a finer-grained extension of #18441. \r\n\r\nConcrete example: my vscoq extension provides language support for Coq, and incoming users are used to very different keybindings depending on whether they're coming from CoqIDE, vim, or emacs. Ideally, I would be able to provide the default keybindings for all of them (in addition to the default bindings that I have chosen to work well with vscode's defaults) -- and the right one would automatically be selected when the user changes their keymap.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I can provide additional keymap extensions that a user can manually select from. But it's not nice that a user has to first choose to use an emacs keymap extension, and then manually configure all of their extensions to also provide emacs-like keybindings (by downloading additional keymap extensions or tediously creating their own keybindings).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18617/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18616","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18616/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18616/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18616/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18616","id":201070967,"number":18616,"title":"[regression]
