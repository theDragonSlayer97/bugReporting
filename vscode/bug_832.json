While I along with others enjoy the git integration, the lack of FTP extensions is what makes me have to use other programs to send the files out. I tried the two ftp extensions and their user friendliness is not completely there. \n\nTo make this short, would be nice to see a simple ftp extension that you can hit a command or right click and say upload, delete, create, etc and then a small notification saying uploaded. Also maybe a panel or command that shows the current server you are connected to. This is similar to plugins found on Sublime Text and Atom. \n\nIf there is a different extension then the ftp sync and ftp simple that produces similar features as to what I described I would gladly check them out.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10810","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10810/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10810/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10810/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10810","id":172560111,"number":10810,"title":"Integrated

the latest state of the work for #10600 for the August release, planned for September 12.\n\nCheck out the latest [insiders build](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders), produced every night (US timezone), to try out the latest and write your extensions... :-)\n## Summary\n\nWe introduce the new concept of 'file icon themes'. File icon themes can be contributed by extensions and selected by users as their favourite set of file icons. File icons are shown in the file explorer, but in the future also at other places like in tab folders.\n## User Settings\n\nTo enable and to pick a icon theme, the user can either:\n- use the global menu File > Preferences > File Icon Theme\n- use the 'File Icon Theme' command (F1)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6461412/18325982/0c28e198-7544-11e6-9f94-e0214ec62742.png)\n\nBy default, no file icon set is configured, therefore the file explorer shows no icons. Once an icon theme is selected, it will be persisted and shown again when restarting VSCode.\n\nOut of the box, VS code ships with two icon themes\n- 'Minimal' consisting only of file and folder icons.  The 'vs-minimal' fileTheme is defined [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/theme-defaults).\n- 'Seti' based on the [Seti UI theme](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui). The 'vs-seti' fileTheme is defined [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/theme-seti).\n\nWe hope the community will contribute many more themes (including the popular vs-icons extension) :-)\n## APIs for Extensions\n\nFor an extension to contribute a new file icon theme, the following contribution point needs to be implemented. Thats in package.json, [as usual](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points).\n\n``` json\n    \"contributes\": {\n        \"iconThemes\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"martin\",\n                \"label\": \"Martin\",\n                \"path\": \"./fileicons/martin-icon-theme.json\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n```\n\nThe `id` is used internally. In the future it might be used in the settings, so keep it not only unique but also readable. `label` is shown in the icon theme configuration dialog.\nThe `path` points to a file in the extension that defines the icon set. If your icon set name follows the `*icon-theme.json` name scheme, you will get completion support and hovers in VS Code.\n### Icon Set File\n\nThe icon set file is a JSON file consisting file icon associations and icon definitions.\n\nA icon association maps a file type ('file', 'folder', 'json-file'...) to an icon definition. Icon definitions define where the icon is located: That can be an image file or also glyph in a font.\n### Icon definitions\n\nThe `iconDefinitions` section contains all definitions. Each definition has an id, which will be used to reference the definition. A definition can be referenced also by more than one file association.\n\n``` json\n    \"iconDefinitions\": {\n        \"_folder_dark\": {\n            \"iconPath\": \"./images/Folder_16x_inverse.svg\"\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nThis icon definition contains definition with the identifier `_folder_dark`.\n\nThe following properties are supported:\n- `iconPath`: When using a svg/png: the path to the image.\n- `fontCharacter`: When using a glyph font: The character in the font to use\n- `fontColor`: When using a glyph font: The color to use for the glyph\n- `fontSize`: When using a font: The font size. By default the size specified in the font specification is used. Should be a relative size (e.g. 150%) to the parent font size.\n- `fontId`: When using a font: The id of the font. If not specified, the first font specified in font specification section will be picked.\n\nPossible additions under consideration are: \n- image path to high resolution image\n### File association\n\nIcons can be associated to folders, folder names, files, file extensions, file names and [language ids](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points#_contributeslanguages).\n\nAdditionally each of these associations can be refined for 'light' and 'highContrast' color themes.\n\nEach file association points to a icon definition.\n\n``` json\n    \"file\": \"_file_dark\",\n    \"folder\": \"_folder_dark\",\n    \"folderExpanded\": \"_folder_open_dark\",\n    \"folderNames\": {\n        \".vscode\": \"_vscode_folder\",\n    },\n    \"fileExtensions\": {\n        \"ini\": \"_ini_file\",\n    },\n    \"fileNames\": {\n        \"win.ini\": \"_win_ini_file\",\n    },\n    \"languageIds\": {\n        \"ini\": \"_ini_file\"\n    },\n    \"light\": {\n        \"folderExpanded\": \"_folder_open_light\",\n        \"folder\": \"_folder_light\",\n        \"file\": \"_file_light\",\n        \"fileExtensions\": {\n            \"ini\": \"_ini_file_light\",\n        }\n    },\n    \"highContrast\": {\n    }\n}\n```\n- `file` is the default file icon, shown for all files that don't match any extension, filename or language id. Currently all properties defined by the definition of the file icon will be inherited (only relevant for font glyphs, useful for the fontSize)\n- `folder` is the folder icon for collapsed folders, and if `folderExpanded` is not set, also for expanded folders. Icons for specific folder names can be associated using the `folderNames` property .\n  The folder icon is optional. If not set, no icon will be shown for folder.\n- `folderExpanded` is the folder icon for expanded folders. The expanded folder icon is optional. If not set, the icon defined for `folder` will be shown.\n- `folderNames` associates folder names to icons. The key of the set is the folder name, not including any path segments. Patterns or wildcards are not supported. Folder name matching is case insensitive.\n- `folderNamesExpanded` associates folder names to icons for expanded folder. The key of the set is the folder name, not including any path segments. Patterns or wildcards are not supported. Folder name matching is case insensitive.\n- `languageIds` associates languages to icons. The key in the set is the language id as defined in the [language contribution point](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points#_contributeslanguages). The language of a file is evaluated based on the file extensions and file names as defined in the language contribution. Note that the 'first line match' of the language contribution is not considered.\n- `fileExtensions` associates file extensions to icons. The key in the set is the file extension name. The extension name is a file name segment after a dot (not including the dot). File names with multiple dots such as `lib.d.ts` can match multiple extensions; 'd.ts' and 'ts'. Extensions are compared case insensitive.\n- `fileNames` associates file names to icons. The key in the set is the full file name, not including any path segments. Patterns or wildcards are not supported. File name matching is case insensitive. A 'fileName' match is the strongest match, and the icon associated to the file name will be preferred over a icon of a matching fileExtension and also of a matching language Id.\n\nA file extension match is preferred over a language match, but is weaker than a file name match.\n\nThe `light` and the `highContrast` section have the same file association properties as just listed. They allow to override icons for the corresponding themes.\n### Font definitions\n\nThe 'fonts' section lets you declare any number of glyph fonts that you want to use. You can later reference these font in the icon definitions. The font declared first will be used as by default if an icon definition does not specify a font id. \n\n``` json\n    \"fonts\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"martin-font\",\n            \"src\": [\n                {\n                    \"path\": \"./martin.woff\",\n                    \"format\": \"woff\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"weight\": \"normal\",\n            \"style\": \"normal\",\n            \"size\": \"150%\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"iconDefinitions\": {\n        \"_file\": {\n            \"fontCharacter\": \"\\\\E002\",\n            \"fontColor\": \"#5f8b3b\",\n            \"fontId\": \"martin-font\"\n        }\n    }\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10804/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":6}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10803","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10803/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10803/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10803/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10803","id":172475199,"number":10803,"title":"Electron
