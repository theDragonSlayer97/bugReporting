Use Code in Split View.\n2. Open a file (C# Monobehaviour) in the left view (file1.cs), and another in the second view (file2.cs).\n3. Create an error in file1.cs, and save. Then switch to file2.cs in the right view.\n4. Jump into Unity, and click on the error message in the console.\n\nYou'll now see file1.cs open another tab in the right view.
