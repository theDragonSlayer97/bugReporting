to this QA in issue 207 :\r\nQ: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/207#issuecomment-318012379\r\nA: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/207#issuecomment-321826340\r\n\r\n**My request :**\r\nWhen starting Code from its icon, or from the command line without file paths as argument : Restore the previous `window.restoreWindows` context, and ignore all sessions where Code was opened with a specific file by double-clicking in a file manager or from the command line with file paths.\r\nRight now, those sessions are not ignored, and replace the last `window.restoreWindows` context.\r\n\r\nSituation:\r\n- VSCode Version:\r\n```\r\nVersion 1.14.2\r\nCommit cb82febafda0c8c199b9201ad274e25d9a76874e\r\nDate 2017-07-19T23:26:08.116Z\r\nShell 1.6.6\r\nRenderer 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode 7.4.0\r\n```\r\n- OS Version:\r\n```\r\n\"uname --all\" output:\r\nLinux ladyluck 4.12.3-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Jul 22 15:32:02 UTC 2017 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Reproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nPreferences: `\"window.restoreWindows\": \"all\"`\r\n```\r\n`window.restoreWindows` context :\r\n```\r\nOne VSC window with a project folder opened. All files saved.\r\nOne VSC window with just a bunch of files opened. Some with unsaved changes.\r\nCtrl+Q to close all VSC windows and quit VSC.\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. **Reopening** VSC (as per the title of  issue https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/207) works as expected. Both windows are restored with all files.\r\n2. Ctrl+Q again.\r\n3. Then double-clicking a source file in the file manager, opens one VSC window with just the double-clicked file.\r\n4. Ctrl+Q again.\r\n5. Start VSC from its icon, and one window opened with just the one file (that was double-clicked from the file manager).\r\n6. I restored the initial 2 windows with Ctrl+N, followed by Open recent.\r\n\r\nAt step 5, starting VSC from its icon, I had expected that would first open the 2 VSC windows. And that the source file (double clicked from the file manager) would be added to one of the 2 VSC windows. And that that window would be pushed to the foreground.\r\nSimilar to what happens now when there are already VSC windows opened, and you then double-click a source file from the file manager.\r\n\r\nAdding the double-clicked file manager or command line file(s) to the 2 VSC windows is of course debatable. Some users might want a complete separation between whether Code was already started before the first file was double-clicked, and whether Code was still closed before the first double-click.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32337","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32337/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32337/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32337/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32337","id":249691689,"number":32337,"title":"Debug:
