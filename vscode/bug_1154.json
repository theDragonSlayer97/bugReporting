https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3ux8fs/announcing_typescript_17/cxo5ldn?context=3.\n\n> I just updated VSCode to the latest version (0.10.3) and reduced this problem to a small case, and I'm really confused:\n> 1. A simple internal module, a simple .d.ts referencing it. Everything works fine: http://i.imgur.com/O8uIQFT.png\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/O8uIQFT.png)\n2. I create a plain .js file. Even without writing to it or saving it again, I get Schrodinger's interface: http://i.imgur.com/siOf1AV.png\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/siOf1AV.png)\n\n> At this point, the errors about the interface file won't go away. After I close the .js file in the editor, close the folder, and reopen the folder, things go back to normal. But as soon as I open a plain .js file, they come back just like before. After the errors get triggered, I can close the .js file and they stay in the status bar. If I then add both the module and the .d.ts to the \"working files\" list, then remove .d.ts from it, the errors vanish again.\n\nWe're not sure what sort of interaction might be going on with the TypeScript language service, so we felt it would be better filed here.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1156","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1156/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1156/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1156/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1156","id":121382454,"number":1156,"title":"

To be honest I can't even figure out the rules, sometimes a search matches something and then I try something similar and it doesn't match.\nIn any case, it would be great if it could be improved to approach Atom's level of fuzziness. For example with my change-case plugin, I would expect a search for _case sep_ to find the a number of commands, but it doesn't.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1146","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1146/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1146/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1146/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1146","id":121320276,"number":1146,"title":"Tasks
