(truncated)|Version\r\n---|---|---\r\ncsharp|ms-|1.11.0\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe menu \"Los\" is not understandable. Is it a fate, or a lot, or a batch, or does it mean \"Let's go!\" Go … where? Was that \"Go\" in English? That would be \"gehen\" in German. Probably just a stupid as in English. It might be helpful to use the translation for \"Go to\" which would be \"Gehe zu\". Some commands in that menu are actually called \"Gehe zu (…)\".\r\n\r\nThe second command in that menu is \"Weiterleiten\" which means forwarding something to somebody. An e-mail message for example, that can be forwarded. From the surrounding commands I guess that you did not mean \"to forward\" but \"the direction forward\" which is \"vorwärts\" in German. The opposite of \"zurück\" (\"back\").\r\n\r\nAlso, the hotkeys are highly inconsistent. Some are positioned at the right end of the menu popup, in grey colour, but completely in English. Others are appended to the command text, left-aligned, in black colour, and partially translated (\"Ctrl\" was translated to \"STRG\" (correct would be \"Strg\") and arrow key names are still in English). These have brackets around them. Why does it look like somebody threw a bomb in there?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30770","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30770/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30770/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30770/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30770","id":243188676,"number":30770,"title":"allow disable of recent history in \"go to file\" command","user":{"login":"mfrost66","id":3818866,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3818866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66","html_url":"https://github.com/mfrost66","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfrost66/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":527005453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/quick-pick","name":"quick-pick","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-07-15T17:29:58Z","updated_at":"2017-07-16T17:26:05Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I'd like the ability to disable showing the \"recent history\" portion of the file list in the `go to file` command, or at least collapsed so I don't have to visually scan to find the files list. \r\n\r\nFor me, it quickly becomes both noisey (lots of false matches that I have to visually skip) and incorrect (debugger files, old files, etc).  \r\n\r\nI find myself clearing the history multiple times daily to limit the noise.

Do you have a question?

Add this snippet to any language (I used Batch but the language doesn't seem to matter)\r\n```json\r\n\"Test\": {\r\n\t\"prefix\": \"test\",\r\n\t\"body\": [ \"test ${1:replaceme}\" ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Open a fresh file in the snippet's language\r\n3. Type \"te\" and hit return to activate the snippet\r\n4. Type a value to replace the placeholder\r\n5. Hit return to go to the next line\r\n6. Repeat steps 2-5\r\n7. Repeat step 3\r\n8. Observe that your curser is now AFTER the placeholder and the placeholder isn't selected\r\n9. Optionally continue repeating and observe that previous placeholders become highlighted unexpectedly\r\n\r\nI expected that the snippets would continue to behave as they did for the first two lines. This issue also occurs when using a `CompletionItemProvider` in an extension to provide completions with `SnippetString`s. Note that if that there are any characters after the placeholder in the snippet, e.g. `\"body\": [ \"test ${1:replaceme}_\" ]`, the issue does not occur. \r\n\r\nEDIT: I tested this issue against version 1.15.0-insider, and the behavior is different, but it is still reproducible in the same way (fewer steps, actually).

I would actually prefer to reference it directly in the contributes section using something like what I have below, but the local path would need to be resolved by VS Code to the extension

VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.15.0-insider (47a49c7fb8138fd27e2a95259ae96e9ac49a65a5, 2017-07-14T07:44:53.821Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.15063\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhile working on a task provider for the Haxe extension, I noticed that trying to customize a task without a task definition in `package.json` causes an exception. Of course the fix is to provide a task definition, but it could probably still be handled a bit more gracefully.\r\n\r\nIt seems reasonable to assume that when implementing a provider, people don't usually create the task definition right away, but instead try to get some tasks running first. Also, it's easy to miss that anything is wrong at all if you never try to customize a task / don't know about that feature (_running_ the task works fine).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n'use strict';\r\nimport * as vscode from 'vscode';\r\n\r\nexport function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {\r\n    vscode.workspace.registerTaskProvider(\"test\", {\r\n        provideTasks: () => {\r\n            return [createTask(\"hello world\")];\r\n        },\r\n        resolveTask(task: vscode.Task): vscode.Task | undefined {\r\n            return task;\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction createTask(message: string): vscode.Task {\r\n    return new vscode.Task({\r\n        type: \"unknown\"\r\n    }, message, \"test\", new vscode.ShellExecution(\"echo \" + message));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Run the `test: hello world` task.\r\n2. Select \"Never scan the task output\", which attempts to custimize the task and produces an exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'properties' of undefined\r\n    at Object.e.from
