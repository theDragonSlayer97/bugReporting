a contributable application menu seems like a inevitable feature coming since the `menus.ts` is growing more and more and every feature has its part in there. We'd like to disconnect all of that and have contributions come in with menu items. For example, the whole Debug menu should come in via the debug part.\r\n\r\nFor this to happen, we've come up with the following plan:\r\n\r\n1. Create a `CommandService` in the Main process, which simply forwards command calls to the active window.\r\n2. Create a `MenuRegistry` and `MenuService` in the main process. Figure out how to work around the fact that it requires a `ContextKeyService` (make it optional?) and how to get sub-menus in there.\r\n3. Adopt the whole application menu from `menus.ts` into MenuItems. Create a new menu id for the Application menu. Should it be only 1? Should the `File` be one, the `Edit` be another, etc?\r\n4. Whenever each renderer contributes menuitems to a menu that _lives_ in the main process, we need to serialize those calls to the `MenuRegistry` over to the main process.\r\n\r\n@bpasero @jrieken
