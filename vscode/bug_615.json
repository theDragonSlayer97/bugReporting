VSCode Version: 1.8.0\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10.0.14393\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a project folder and create `func.js`, `main.js`, and `jsconfig.json` in it.\r\n\r\n`jsconfig.json`:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n        \"target\": \"ES6\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"file\": [\r\n        \"func.js\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`func.js`:\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction Test() {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n// ...\r\nTest.a = function() {\r\n    // ...\r\n    var k = require('n');\r\n    // ...\r\n    return 0;\r\n};\r\n// ...\r\nTest.prototype.b = function() {\r\n    // ...\r\n    var k = require('n');\r\n    // ...\r\n    return 1;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n`main.js`:\r\n```javascript\r\nTest.a();\r\nvar test = new Test();\r\ntest.b();\r\n```\r\n2. Open main.js, and move mouse on `Test` or `a()` at line 1, the ToolTip shows `any`, move mouse on any words, the ToolTip shows the sentence that have `any`. Also autocomplete do not show `a` when I type `Test.` and `b` when I type `test.`.\r\n\r\n3. Edit `func.js`, make lines which has `require` as comment, like :\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction Test() {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n// ...\r\nTest.a = function() {\r\n    // ...\r\n    //var k = require('n');\r\n    // ...\r\n    return 0;\r\n};\r\n// ...\r\nTest.prototype.b = function() {\r\n    // ...\r\n    //var k = require('n');\r\n    // ...\r\n    return 1;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n4. Open main.js, and move mouse on `Test` at line 1 and line 2, the ToolTip shows `function Test(): void`, but move mouse on  `a()` at line 1, the ToolTip still shows `any`, move mouse on any words at line 2 and line 3, the ToolTip shows the sentence that haven't `any`. For example, `test` shows\r\n```javascript\r\nvar test: {\r\n    b: () => number;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n5. Output `Test.a()` can get `0`, `test.b()` can get `1`. At Step 4, Visual Studio Code found the definition of `test.b()` as `Test.prototype.b` (move mouse on `b()` at line 3 and the ToolTip shows `(property) Test.b: () => number`), but not found the definition of `Test.a()` because move mouse on `a()` at line 1 and the ToolTip shows `any`. Also autocomplete show `b` when I type `test.`, but not show `a` when I type `Test.`.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nIf the definition of the method or prototype of function in JavaScript have method `require()` in it, Intellisense in Visual Studio Code cannot find the definition of \"that function, the prototype of that function, and the method of that function\" at another JS file.\r\nIf the definition of the method or prototype of function in JavaScript do not have method `require()` in it, Intellisense in Visual Studio Code can find the definition of \"that function, and the prototype of that function\" at another JS file, but still cannot find the definition of method of that function at another JS file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17338","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17338/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17338/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17338/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17338","id":195885075,"number":17338,"title":"Terminix support","user":{"login":"TheAifam5","id":2192274,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2192274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheAifam5","html_url":"https://github.com/TheAifam5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheAifam5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheAifam5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheAifam5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheAifam5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheAifam5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheAifam5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheAifam5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheAifam5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheAifam5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-12-15T18:53:32Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T13:12:05Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: VIsual Code Insiders 1.9.0 89bdb7c35a89535612d386199ee33e6bd74ee068\r\n- OS Version: ArchLinux\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

VSCode Version: 1.8\r\n\r\nHey guys! I had a discussion on Hacker News with @mjbvz about this new feature.\r\n\r\nI think the feature could be improved by copying what the extension [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense) provides.\r\n\r\nSome screenshots will speak for themselves. \r\n\r\nHere is the extension:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-15 at 11 20 11](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/591804/21234914/3e11a10e-c2ba-11e6-8e85-1b0d94a5299f.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-15 at 11 20 22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/591804/21234917/41bcbd34-c2ba-11e6-91ae-5feec9f62ce1.png)\r\n\r\nI didn't look at the code but I would bet that they detect when a string starts with `'./'` or `'../'` and then list the files and folders in the current or previous directory.\r\n\r\n**IMO it's perfect and it's exactly what I expect from a paths autocomplete.**\r\n\r\nFor comparison, here is the native feature:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-15 at 11 21 11](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/591804/21234921/44982bb0-c2ba-11e6-9182-d19daee0d5a2.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-15 at 11 24 41](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/591804/21234925/46be00d6-c2ba-11e6-9925-353f34f36cd8.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-12-15 at 11 24 47](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/591804/21234927/4897d030-c2ba-11e6-8074-cec1030b8401.png)\r\n\r\nMy thoughts:\r\n\r\n1) **Intellisense suggests a lot of things (paths, snippets, symbols in the current file, etc)!**\r\n\r\nOn this screenshot, the file contains few lines of code (it's the `./index.js` of the project) so the list of suggestions is relatively small. But I tried in another project, in a file with 300 LOC and a lot of symbols, and the list of suggestions was really too long.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion I was looking for was `components` which is the first folder of the project in alphabetical order. When I started typing, `components` was not in the first visible suggestions. Actually I had to type almost the full name of the folder, i.e. `'./compon'`, to get the suggestion.\r\n\r\n2) **The 🔧  icon is not really intuitive.**\r\n\r\nThe extension uses a file icon. You could display a folder ( 📁 ) or a file ( 📄 ) in function of the suggestion.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nHope these feedbacks can help.\r\n\r\nThanks for the amazing work! 🙂\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17330","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17330/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17330/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17330/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17330","id":195875592,"number":17330,"title":"Add setting to limit quick open results to current opened folder","user":{"login":"pharmmd-rich","id":16308798,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16308798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pharmmd-rich","html_url":"https://github.com/pharmmd-rich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pharmmd-rich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pharmmd-rich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pharmmd-rich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pharmmd-rich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pharmmd-rich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pharmmd-rich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pharmmd-rich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pharmmd-rich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pharmmd-rich/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":301186618,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/search","name":"search","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-12-15T18:09:44Z","updated_at":"2017-01-19T16:05:42Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Right now, quick open (Command/Ctrl P) searches outside the currently opened folder for files.

VSCode Version: 1.9.0-insider\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.12.2\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I love this editor, it's making me switch away from Sublime and vim.\r\n\r\nHowever, working on a very large code base (the Linux kernel), I have a workflow that is suboptimal. I heavily rely on the \"find in files\" feature, as the C/C++ intellisense can't go far enough to solve all the things I usually look for (think: nested macros and such), which is totally ok.\r\n\r\nSo, this is my typical workflow:\r\n\r\n1) CMD+Shift+F, enter the text to search and press enter\r\n2) I get many matches, and usually I need to scan through the matching occurrences (in preview mode in an editor) in order to fully understand the one I need (the line shown in the side bar is usually not enough). In Sublime (or vim), I can quickly open an editor showing the matching occurrences using F4/Shift-F4.\r\n\r\nIn Code, using the keyboard the two only options I can find are:\r\n\r\n- In the search side bar, press \"down\" until I highlight a match, and then I can open the file pressing \"enter\". However, this makes me lose the focus in the side bar, so it becomes super inefficient if I want to switch to the next matching file.\r\n\r\n- If, at the previous step, I press \"space\" instead of \"enter\", the file gets opened but I don't lose the focus, which is already much better, but less than ideal because to go to the next occurrence I still have to press first \"down\" twice and then \"space\" again, and the fact that it's not documented makes me a bit uncomfortable, as I heavily rely on this hotkey.\r\n\r\nIt seems like having hotkeys to jump to the next occurrence while in the side bar is definitely a common case for relatively power users. It's literally an operation I do hundreds of times a day, so every bit of efficiency I can gain is huge (and it's standard in Sublime and of course customizable in vim).\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17323","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17323/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17323/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17323/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17323","id":195861032,"number":17323,"title":"Debugging not working with v8 version 3.12.19.19","user":{"login":"CodeCloak","id":10749782,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10749782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeCloak","html_url":"https://github.com/CodeCloak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeCloak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeCloak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeCloak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeCloak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeCloak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeCloak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeCloak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeCloak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeCloak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-12-15T17:07:51Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T16:44:04Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.8.0\r\n- OS Version: Win 7 enterprise 64 bit\r\n- Node Version: 6.5.0 (Also tested with 4.1.2 and 4.6.0)\r\n\r\n\r\nHello, I work at Everi Games and we are evaluating Visual Studio Code as an editor to replace Webstorm (We script games in Javascript on top of a C++ engine using v8).
