a recent section in the `settings.json` file for overwrite `editor` defaults for specific languages.\r\nAn specific and isolated section just for that.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"[go]\": {\r\n    \"editor.insertSpaces\": false\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  \"[makefile]\": {\r\n    \"editor.insertSpaces\": false\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  \"[markdown]\": {\r\n    \"editor.wordWrap\": \"on\",\r\n    \"editor.quickSuggestions\": false\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  \"[yaml]\": {\r\n    \"editor.insertSpaces\": true,\r\n    \"editor.tabSize\": 2\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is a bit counterintuitive.\r\nIf you want to change something specifically related to Markdown, the logic will make you to check the markdown section. Because you want to change some behaviour related to that kind of files. The same applies to the rest of languages. That was my case. I didn't knew about this specific overwritting and I went a little crazy when I updated my default editor config `editor.wordWrap` and it was working in all files... but markdown ones. So I quick checked the issues here and, eventually, I found in the code that there is an specific override for markdown files... in a section apart.\r\n\r\nEven if you know about this section, it seems like a problem. Now, even if there isn't any overwritting at all for your specific language, you will need to check also that isolated section «just in case» there is something new overwritting anything that you aren't aware of.\r\n\r\nDon't you think that having all the settings about a language in the language section is a better approach? As example, something like this, for the Markdown section:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"markdown.styles\": [],\r\n  \"markdown.previewFrontMatter\": \"hide\",\r\n  \"markdown.preview.fontFamily\": \"'Segoe WPC', 'Segoe UI', 'SFUIText-Light', 'HelveticaNeue-Light', sans-serif\",\r\n  \"markdown.preview.fontSize\": 14,\r\n  \"markdown.preview.lineHeight\": 1.6,\r\n  \"markdown.preview.scrollPreviewWithEditorSelection\": true,\r\n  \"markdown.preview.markEditorSelection\": true,\r\n  \"markdown.preview.scrollEditorWithPreview\": true,\r\n  \"markdown.preview.doubleClickToSwitchToEditor\": true,\r\n  ...\r\n  \"[markdown]\": {\r\n    \"editor.wordWrap\": \"on\",\r\n    \"editor.quickSuggestions\": false\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note**: comments omitted for the sake of brevity.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21901","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21901/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21901/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21901/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21901","id":211714707,"number":21901,"title":"Directory context menu entry confusingly calls Visual Studio Code by the name \"Code - OSS\"","user":{"login":"sandersaares","id":9914262,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9914262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandersaares","html_url":"https://github.com/sandersaares","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandersaares/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandersaares/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandersaares/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandersaares/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandersaares/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandersaares/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandersaares/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandersaares/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandersaares/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-03-03T15:12:15Z","updated_at":"2017-03-03T15:26:49Z","closed_at":"2017-03-03T15:26:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"VSCode Version:\r\nVersion 1.10.1\r\nCommit 653f8733dd5a5c43d66d7168b4701f94d72b62e5\r\nDate 2017-03-02T00:33:15.706Z\r\nShell 1.4.6\r\nRenderer 53.0.2785.143\r\nNode 6.5.0\r\nOS Version: Windows 10 (14393.693)\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9914262/23556223/81eec03e-0034-11e7-9528-e788cbff02d2.png)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

When you make a selection and there are multiple instances, it's extremely hard to distinguish which one is actually selected. This image shows VSCode's standard Monokai theme. This is not a \"theme\" issue, users should be able to use any theme that is available in the marketplace. \r\n\r\n2. When you make a selection, matching instances shouldn't be highlighted at all. Being highlighted indicates that they are also selected, which is not the case. So when I double click on a single word to select it, all the matching instances get highlighted too, creating the appearance that they are all selected.\r\n\r\n3. The check that looks for matching instances should be _case sensitive_, so that when I select `contract`, a camel-case instance of `newContract` should not have that instance of contract highlighted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21898/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21897","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21897/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21897/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21897/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21897","id":211701872,"number":21897,"title":"Updating VS Code - not working on macOS Sierra","user":{"login":"Marshevskyy","id":6871431,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6871431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marshevskyy","html_url":"https://github.com/Marshevskyy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marshevskyy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marshevskyy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marshevskyy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marshevskyy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marshevskyy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marshevskyy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marshevskyy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marshevskyy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marshevskyy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-03T14:27:04Z","updated_at":"2017-03-03T15:43:04Z","closed_at":"2017-03-03T15:42:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

-> release CMD -> release SHIFT\" system will detect a keypress event of SHIFT key and change the input mode, which is very annoying in coding job\r\n\r\nI know this issue is related to webkit since google chrome has the exact same behavior, however vscode is deeply affected by it because there are many key combinations when coding, e.g. \"CMD + SHIFT + LEFT\" to select characters before cursor, this can randomly trigger the change of input mode, so is it possible this issue could be fixed in the scope of
