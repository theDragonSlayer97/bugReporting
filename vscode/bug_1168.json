was developing an extension and had to replace the text in my editor with text that was changed. For this, I was thinking about a reusable function as you can see here: https://github.com/SamVerschueren/vscode-set-text/blob/master/index.ts\n\nIt works when I test it locally, so that's good. But I am struggling with publishing it to npm.\n\nFirst of all, the type definition is written by hand, is there an easy way to generate it automatically? If I do it with the `--definition` flag, the exported type definition seems incorrect.\n\nSecondly, when installing the module, the type definition shows errors which means I can't import the method correctly with `import setText from 'vscode-set-text'`.\n\nIs there anyone out there that can help me with it or link me to documentation that helps me get this out the door?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/721","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/721/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/721/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/721/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/721","id":119099718,"number":721,"title":"dead

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85)\n\nIn the UI and in the `keybindings.json` file, VSCode represents OEM key codes using the US standard keyboard:\n- `VK_OEM_1` (0xBA) as `;`\n- `VK_OEM_PLUS` (0xBB) as `=`\n- `VK_OEM_COMMA` (0xBC) as `,`\n- `VK_OEM_MINUS` (0xBD) as `-`\n- `VK_OEM_PERIOD` (0xBE) as `.`\n- `VK_OEM_2` (0xBF) as `/`\n- `VK_OEM_3` (0xC0) as `\n- `VK_OEM_4` (0xDB) as `[`\n- `VK_OEM_5` (0xDC) as `\\`\n- `VK_OEM_6` (0xDD) as `]`\n- `VK_OEM_7` (0xDE) as `'`\n\n---\n\n**This means when VSCode renders in the UI a keybinding as `Ctrl+/`, it actually means `Ctrl+VK_OEM_2`.** \n- When using a US standard layout, `VK_OEM_2` is physically labeled as `/?` and sits next to the right hand side `Shift`, but \n- when using a Swiss German keyboard layout, for example, `VK_OEM_2` is physically labeled as `§°` and sits next to `1`.\n\n---\n\nThis makes life **quite difficult** for us who use non-US standard keyboard layouts (I'm using a Swiss German keyboard on my laptop).\n\n---\n\nThe only way to make this experience great for non-US standard keyboards is to be able to read the current set keyboard layout from the OS and then:\n- render these OEM key codes in the UI according to the configured keyboard layout.\n- register multiple default keybindings per action and per keyboard layout.\n-  **AFAIK, at this time, this is not possible in electron**.\n\n---\n\nIn the short term, **I would like to ask passionate non US standard keyboard layout developers to create and publish extensions** that overwrite the default VSCode keybindings with keyboard layout optimized variants. Such an extension is super easy to author, it would only consist of a `package.json` that [contributes keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points#_contributeskeybindings)\n\n---\n\n**Update 30.11.2015**: Electron renders the keybindings correctly in the native menu, now it is a question if it will provide API for the JavaScript side to do so too:\n\nUnder German (Switzerland), `Split Editor` gets correctly rendered in the menu as `Ctrl+ä`:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5047891/11470752/9ac20014-9760-11e5-9be5-0d55bedf9483.png)\n\nWhile the JS side renders it incorrectly as `Ctrl+\\`:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5047891/11470782/cfba5e92-9760-11e5-9343-6cb02c5f35d3.png)\n\natom/electron#3631 tracks the API request to
