issues is in regards to the ```problemMatcher``` in ```tasks.json```. In some cases, adding a capture group for `severity` which includes info/note causes some regex matches to be ignored.\r\n\r\nConsider the following regex which should match gcc/g++ compilation output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"problemMatcher\": {\r\n\t\"owner\": \"cpp\",\r\n\t\"fileLocation\": [\"relative\", \"${workspaceRoot}\"],\r\n\t\"pattern\": {\r\n\t\t\"regexp\": \"^(.*):(\\\\d+):(\\\\d+):\\\\s+(?:.*)?\\\\s*(warning|error):\\\\s+(.*)\",\r\n\t\t\"file\": 1,\r\n\t\t\"line\": 2,\r\n\t\t\"column\": 3,\r\n\t\t\"severity\": 4,\r\n\t\t\"message\": 5\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above regex matches all warning and error messages. However, if I modify the regex to capture all \"note\" information, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"regexp\": \"^(.*):(\\\\d+):(\\\\d+):\\\\s+(?:.*)?\\\\s*(warning|error|note):\\\\s+(.*)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen some of the error messages are skipped in the \"Problems\" window. This only happens when multiple files have errors matched by the regex.\r\n\r\nAttached is a minimum repro for Windows 10 (with WSL) and Linux. Requires g++ 4.9.\r\n\r\n[VSCodeWorkspace.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/1090295/VSCodeWorkspace.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is *not* a bug with the C/C++ plugin; the plugin is merely being

am developing an extension which runs a shell command on the active document.  For this to work I need to save the active document first.  I can do this using `TextDocument.save()`.  However, if the user has created a new, untitled document, then `save()` closes the document.  In addition, the document's fileName is not updated to reflect the save path.\r\n\r\nThis is related to #25729 but the workaround described there does not work for me because I do not control the creation of the untitled file, and there seems to be no way to get the file path after the save.  So I cannot use that to reopen the document or pass its file path to my command line.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository https://github.com/itowlson/vscode-sauve-qui-peut, or create a new repository and copy in the following code from https://github.com/itowlson/vscode-sauve-qui-peut/blob/master/src/extension.ts and hook it up to a command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nasync function withActiveDocument(action: (doc : vscode.TextDocument) => Promise<void>) {\r\n    const activeEditor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;\r\n    if (!activeEditor) {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const doc = activeEditor.document;\r\n    if (!doc) {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    await action(doc);\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nasync function trySave(doc : vscode.TextDocument) : Promise<void> {\r\n    if (doc.isUntitled) {\r\n        const saved = await doc.save();\r\n        vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Document ${saved ? \"was\" : \"was not\"} saved. Check document is still open.`);\r\n    } else {\r\n        vscode.window.showErrorMessage('Please test on an unsaved document');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(The problem still occurs without the asyncs and awaits, though it fails in a slightly different way if you inline the save call in the command handler instead of calling via `withActiveDocument`.)\r\n\r\n2. Run the extension in the Extension Development Host.\r\n\r\n3. Hit Ctrl+N to create a new untitled file.  Type some garbage into the file.\r\n\r\n4. Run the contributed command (e.g. `Ctrl+Shift+P > Sauve Qui Peut`).\r\n\r\n5. At the save prompt, enter a file name and hit OK.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour: The document remains open in the editor, and its fileName is updated to reflect the save path.\r\n\r\nActual behaviour: The document disappears out of the editor.  If the document object is inspected in the debugger, its fileName is still \"Untitled-1\".\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: Code 1.13.1 (379d2efb5539b09112c793d3d9a413017d736f89,

using Visual Code daily, so I would want one issue to be handled. When writing an HTML code in some online text editors when I put a &lt;p&gt; tag inside another &lt;p&gt; tag, I get a reasonable syntax error indicating that it is not right, because we can't give any CSS properties (just can't style) that inner &lt;p&gt; tag. But maybe for some reasons it doesn't give any kind of snytax error when I type in Visual Code. So I think that it would be great if this issue was taken into account by Visual Code Developers.

In the last week, I've been experiencing multiple errors (randomly: ENOTEMPTY, EPERM, EBUSY) during the building process of the app while Visual Code open.\r\n\r\nThe .meteor folder is included to the **files.exclude**; this is to prevent visual code to scan the files created by meteor during the building process (which would slow down the build process).

Please, correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nIssue also referenced: \r\n#https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/8801\r\n![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18633763/27351694-11f86648-55b3-11e7-99d3-338e58cca06a.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29132/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29131","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29131/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29131/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29131/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29131","id":237305277,"number":29131,"title":"Go to Definiton (F12)","user":{"login":"jbelusic","id":29581162,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/29581162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbelusic","html_url":"https://github.com/jbelusic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbelusic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbelusic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbelusic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbelusic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbelusic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbelusic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbelusic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbelusic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbelusic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":427411234,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/extension-candidate","name":"extension-candidate","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-06-20T18:36:33Z","updated_at":"2017-06-21T06:08:39Z","closed_at":"2017-06-21T06:08:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.13.1 (379d2efb5539b09112c793d3d9a413017d736f89, 2017-06-14T18:21:47.485Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\r\n- Extensions: none\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.
