In a demo.tex, type `eqnmultiline` which will insert a code snippet as follows:\r\n```\r\n   \\[\r\n        \\begin{array}{lcl}\r\n             foo & = & foo \\\r\n             & = & foo \\\r\n             & = & foo \\\r\n        \\end{array}\r\n    \\]\r\n```\r\nAnd I'm expecting a `\\\\` at the end of the three foo lines, which I use `\\\\\\\\` to escape. But the result is one `\\`  at each line. \r\n[Snippet Grammer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_grammar) says using `\\` to escape `\\`. So I'm wondering if this is a bug.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: \r\n**Correct** Sorry for not testing using suggested `code --disable-extensions` before because I missed that line in comment .
