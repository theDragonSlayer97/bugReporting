primary goal is to have awesome git messages through the power of templates + snippets. \n\nWe were looking to use git's commit templates for [better git commit messages](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/better-commit-messages-with-a-gitmessage-template), similar to [Angular's conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit). But we also love the super easy git integration directly in vs code. \n\nWe'd like to somehow combine the two. Currently, we can use our git commit template via the following steps: \n1. Stage the files in the git window using `ctrl+shift+G` and then the mouse (less than ideal, but that's a separate issue).\n2. Open up a command line quick-like with `ctrl+shift+C` and type `git commit`, which brings up the git commit msg editor. \n\nAccording to #3876, we could conceivably set up vscode to be the default git commit editor when typing the `git commit`, but that still seems klunky - not to mention the fact that gitmode isn't available to install. I was thinking of giving a vscode extension a go which would allow for snippets within the git commit message. But perhaps there is a better solution that we're not seeing.\n\nSo...\n- Is there already a good solution for this that we're not finding?\n- If we make an extension, would we have access to the git message editor to use snippets and to read the default git message template?\n- If we make an extension, would it be possible to use the primary text editors of vs code?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7829","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7829/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7829/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7829/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7829","id":160947461,"number":7829,"title":"Git submodule support","user":{"login":"stofte","id":1641710,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1641710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stofte","html_url":"https://github.com/stofte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stofte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stofte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stofte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stofte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stofte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stofte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stofte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stofte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stofte/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":296835379,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/git","name":"git","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":27,"created_at":"2016-06-17T18:24:17Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T17:39:02Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:\n  1.2.1\n- OS Version:\n  Windows 8.1 x64\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. git clone --recursive repo-with-sub-module\n2. code .\n3.
