I'll try to show it with one example.\n\nWhen you type `prop` in C#, then press `Tab` it will result to \n`public int PropertyName { get; set; }` and that's fantastic.\n\nBut if you type `for, if, while`, or any keyword that is both code snippet and c# known keyword, you cannot access the snippet by pressing `Tab`.
