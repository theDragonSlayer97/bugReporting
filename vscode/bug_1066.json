combination: `AltGr+L` (right Alt + L and no Ctrl key) is also working for this task, and this is a problem.\n\n`AltGr+L` on my keyboard reserved for a letter `ł`, I can rebind the key combination used by extension but this indicate that in general there should be a difference between `CTRL+Alt` and `AltGr`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3783","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3783/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3783/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3783/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3783","id":139090197,"number":3783,"title":"VSCode

Code does not report errors in `tsconfig.json`, and then silently drops the ball without telling the user. This is particularly annoying since some things might continue working, while others mysteriously stop.\n\nErrors in `tsconfig.json` come in two flavours – actual syntactical errors, but also unrecognized new properties. In particular the latter is annoying, for example when TypeScript adds new features such as `--allowUnreachableCode` (see #3428).\n\nMy suggestion would be to at least visibly and loudly report this, but preferably be more lenient about what's accepted (e.g. unrecognized properties).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3782","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3782/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3782/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3782/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3782","id":139034975,"number":3782,"title":"Test
