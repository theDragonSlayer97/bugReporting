So I just took a series of screenshots so that maybe you guys could figure out the pattern. It has not been causing any issues for me at all, except for seeming weird. Hopefully it doesn't affect anyone's code, but I know sometimes a seemingly-small problem can turn out to balloon later on, so I just wanted to help you catch it just in case it does! :)\n\n**Problem:** When collapsing blocks of code (in this case line # 253), the one in the photo collapses, but then offers me a \"minus sign\" to collapse an un-collapsable line (# 273). It seems to collapse the one line of whitespace after it (# 274), and that's it. But it is a closing brace.\n\n**Hypothesis:** Since I have an indented block of code (starting line # 275) beneath the property that I am defining on line # 253, I believe it is trying to alert me that I can close it. If so, and if issue is a feature not a bug, that feature is very confusing/unclear. (see Image 4)\n\nIf in fact my hypothesis is correct, may I suggest using a different icon to indicate the ability to collapse indented lines beneath an object (which really does make sense, but again, is unclear in the context of collapsing the code blocks above it), since it is not technically an encapsulated code block that is being collapsed.\n\n**Image 1**\n<img width=\"891\" alt=\"code
