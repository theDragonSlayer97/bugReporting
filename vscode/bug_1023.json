Extension provides a setting which specifies a path to a tool configuration file that ships in the extension's install dir.  \n2. We want to allow the user to override this path in either a user setting or a workspace setting.\n3. We would rather not require the user have to specify a hard-coded absolute path (C:\\foo\\bar...) when they override the setting at either the `user` level or the `workspace` level (.vscode\\settings.json).\n4. So how does an extension handle this situation?  Using a naked relative path e.g. `./ScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1` would be confusing because the meaning of `.` would likely change depending on which setting file is in effect (global, user or workspace).  \n5. I would prefer that our extension could ask VSCode to `expand` certain variables for us before sending the `settings path` to the extension (either during extension activation or when a user changes a settings file).  I would like to see these variables available: `${workspaceRoot}`, `${extensionRoot}` and perhaps `${home}`.  \n6. The primary scenario I want to see enabled is having a setting value like `\"${workspaceRoot}\\custom-settings.psd1`\" get translated to an absolute path by VSCode and that absolute path is then provided to the extension e.g. `\"C:\\work\\PowerShell\\MyNewModule\\custom-settings.psd1\"`.\n\ncc @daviwil
