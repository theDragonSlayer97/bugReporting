would be nice to have a watcher task as preLaunchTask in launch.json. At the moment this is not possible because the launch task will not start before the preLaunchTask ends.\nA long running preLaunchTask should have a regex similar to problemMatcher to wait for a specific text in the output window before executing the launch task.\nIn my scenario I'm running webpack dev server as a watcher task. I want this task to run if <kbd>F5</kbd> is hit and the preLaunchTask is not running. To delay the debugger launch it would be useful to test for a specific string in the output window `webpack: bundle is now VALID.`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6209/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6208","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6208/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6208/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6208/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6208","id":153757949,"number":6208,"title":"Read from OutputChannel in a vscode extension","user":{"login":"skolmer","id":2427106,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2427106?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolmer","html_url":"https://github.com/skolmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skolmer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":290465400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/api","name":"api","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-09T11:40:29Z","updated_at":"2016-05-10T06:25:21Z","closed_at":"2016-05-10T06:25:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I want to read logging information from the Tasks OutputChannel and show a status bar information based on this data.
