Intellisense completion will work fine for a little bit, then start coming up extremely slowly, and then will not come up at all.  Error checking is also extremely lagged.  After a little bit it will start working again.  It seems like Ominsharp is completely dying and restarting in the background.  It feels like switching files will cause it to happen more often.  It's not something that resetting Code seems to help with, and happens at least every minute so Code is completely unusable on this project.

to the docs [\"Autodetecting Gulp, Grunt and Jake Tasks\"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_autodetecting-gulp-grunt-and-jake-tasks), **`gulpfile.js` at project root** is loaded and tasks in that are listed automatically.\n\n`gulpfile.js`:\n\n``` js\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\ngulp.task('gulpfileTASK1', function() {});\ngulp.task('gulpfileTASK2', function() {});\ngulp.task('gulpfileTASK3', function() {});\n```\n\nVS Code Command `>Tasks: Run Task`:\n\n```\ngulpfileTASK1\ngulpfileTASK2\ngulpfileTASK3\n```\n\nThis autodetecting is disabled (`gulpfile.js` is ignored) if tasks are defined in `.vscode/tasks.json`, right?\n\n`tasks.json`:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"command\": \"something\",\n  \"isShellCommand\": true,\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"taskName\": \"tasksjsonTASK1\",\n      \"args\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"taskName\": \"tasksjsonTASK2\",\n      \"args\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"taskName\": \"tasksjsonTASK3\",\n      \"args\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nVS Code Command `>Tasks: Run Task` (tasks in `gulpfile.js` are not listed):\n\n```\ntasksjsonTASK1\ntasksjsonTASK2\ntasksjsonTASK3\n```\n\nIt seems that behavior above is right.\nBut if `gulp` is specified to the `command` above (`\"command\": \"gulp\"`), tasks in both files are listed.\n\nVS Code Command `>Tasks: Run Task`:\n\n```\ngulpfileTASK1\ngulpfileTASK2\ngulpfileTASK3\ntasksjsonTASK1\ntasksjsonTASK2\ntasksjsonTASK3\n```\n\nOf course the tasks in `tasks.json` are gulp tasks because `command` is `gulp`. `gulpfileTASK*` tasks should not be listed.\n\nWhen `--gulpfile` is specified, these tasks are listed even if `gulpfile.js` is another named and it is in outside of project root.\n\n`tasks.json`:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"command\": \"gulp\",\n  \"isShellCommand\": true,\n  \"args\": [\n    \"--gulpfile\", \"PATH/TO/OUTSIDE/OF/PROJECT/ANOTHER_NAME.js\"\n  ],\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"taskName\": \"tasksjsonTASK1\",\n      \"args\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"taskName\": \"tasksjsonTASK2\",\n      \"args\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"taskName\": \"tasksjsonTASK3\",\n      \"args\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nVS Code Command `>Tasks: Run Task`:\n\n```\ngulpfileTASK1\ngulpfileTASK2\ngulpfileTASK3\ntasksjsonTASK1\ntasksjsonTASK2\ntasksjsonTASK3\n```\n\nIt seems that the autodetecting is enabled always when `command` is `gulp` even if there is not `gulpfile.js` at project root.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1930/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1929","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1929/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1929/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1929/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1929","id":125959559,"number":1929,"title":"Add

from the inital issue (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extensionbuilders/issues/80)\n\n> Let's see this scenario:\n> - The cursor is placed on whitespace inside a method\n> - The user asks for completions by pressing `CTRL + Space`\n> - The language service is being asked to provide all suggestions\n> - The suggestion box pops up containing all 20k symbols\n> - The user types the character `f`\n> - **VSCode hangs for ~8 seconds** until the letter is displayed and the suggestion box shows only suggestions containing an `f`. (VSCode doesn't ask for suggestions twice. All the time is spent outside the language service. )\n> - typing the next letter is being processed faster but it's still slow. \n\n@joaomoreno fixed this issue on 2015-11-06 telling that there were too many event listeners. With the December update it has become slow again. VSCode hangs now for **~10 seconds** working on the same suggestion list. \nI really hope it's going to be fast again with the January update. It's not funny to work in huge projects now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1922","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1922/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1922/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1922/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1922","id":125932248,"number":1922,"title":"Intellisense

have the tasks.json file below.  I wish there was an integrated deploy task, and that we could natively have multiple top-level tasks defined that each can have their own command but according to various posts out there, we cannot and this kind of workaround is recommended.  But it isn't working for me.  \n\nYou can see that I'm asking to show the output, but when I run the build task via the keyboard shortcut or the <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd> menu, the spinner spins, the first command seems to get run (because I can see the output files get created) but the second doesn't run and doesn't generate any output to the output pane which VSCode makes visible.  The third never runs either.  If I move the `echo 42` to the first position then I'll see 42 in the output window _sometimes_ but it is inconsistent.  If `echo 42` is first and `tsc` is second, tsc does not get run.  The deploy.sh does generate output when run in the terminal, but even if it is first, it doesn't get run or generate output \n\nAlso sometimes, the busy spinner in the bottom left corner gets stuck in the spinning mode, but the \"Terminate Running Task\" does nothing to fix it.  I don't know if this is a task that is really still running, or just a UI that falls out of sync.  Restarting VSCode fixes it.\n\nI even tried wrapping the args like `\"args\": [\"\\\"echo 42\\\"\"]` because in the terminal `bash -c \"echo 42\"` and `bash -c \".\\Deploy.sh\"` work fine.  This seems to have no effect sometimes but other times I get \"bash: echo 42: command not found\" in the output pane.  I suspect there's some kind of delay in refreshing the tasks.json contents into VSCode's memory or something but I haven't really figured it out - I'm mostly just baffled.\n\n``` json\n{\n
