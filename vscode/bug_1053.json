to #4006 \n\nOS X\n\nThis is more of a discussion item mixed with a few issues. This also **only** applies to when Code is not already running.\n\nThere are many repercussions to spawning Code as a direct child of the cli code and we should maybe stay away from it and always spawn as an independent process.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22350/13747501/ce582760-e9f8-11e5-84fa-cf796edd3b09.png)\n\nHere are a few examples why:\n#### Move to background\n1. Launch `code-alpha -w`\n2. Hit <kbd>Ctrl Z</kbd> in the Terminal, which will send that process to the background\n3. Switch to Code's window, it will appear frozen, you can't do anything, spinny comes along\n4. Go back to terminal, run `fg` to bring Code back to life\n#### `SIGINT`\n1. Launch `code-alpha -w`\n2. Type a few characters to get a dirty buffer\n3. Switch back to the Terminal, hit <kbd>Ctrl C</kbd>\n4. Switch back to Code and hit `Cancel` when it asks you about the dirty files\n5. You immediately get an error from the shared process. What happened was that that `SIGINT` caused by <kbd>Ctrl C</kbd> propagated to all our process structure and killed most, except the renderer and its children. After the `Cancel`, the renderer and children became orphan processes.\n\nCheck whether using `detached: true` makes sense.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4947","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507415105","x-github-request-id":"DB37:366E:7930C7:FF80B7:59D9471D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1054>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1052>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d55f5d80cea3fdc48d5ac593dae51730\"","status":"200 OK"}}
