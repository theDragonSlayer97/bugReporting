I've tried renaming the extensions folder and the user config folder to prevent VSCode from loading them but that didn't seem to change anything.\r\n\r\nReverting back to `1.10.2` makes everything work fine again. Launching `code` / `/usr/share/code/bin/code` from the command line seems to work however. Only directly launching `/usr/share/code/code` doesn't work anymore.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I haven't been able to reproduce the problem when trying to install VSCode on a virtual machine, which makes me think the problem might be something I caused myself... but I can't seem to grasp what could do anything like this, since it only happened right after updating VSCode.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24250","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24250/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24250/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24250/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24250","id":220281855,"number":24250,"title":"Unclear error message in chrome debug","user":{"login":"kieferrm","id":4674940,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4674940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm","html_url":"https://github.com/kieferrm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-07T17:43:27Z","updated_at":"2017-04-11T03:27:32Z","closed_at":"2017-04-11T03:27:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"During the Angular test tour.\r\n\r\n1) install Chrome debug extension\r\n2) create chrome launch config\r\n```json\r\n    \"configurations\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"chrome\",\r\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n            \"name\": \"Launch Chrome\",\r\n            \"url\": \"http://localhost:3000\",\r\n            \"webRoot\": \"${workspaceRoot}\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n3) `npm start`\r\n4) start chrome and open page on `http://localhost:3000`\r\n5) launch the created launch config\r\n-> timeout\r\n\r\nWhen chrome is not running everything is fine.
