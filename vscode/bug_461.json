Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.10.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 EDU\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Selecting a page of code by using Ctrl + A\r\n2. Copying the selected codes by using Ctrl + C\r\n3. In Word, Paste (with source format), the whole background is there. \r\n4. In Google Doc, same thing. \r\n\r\nI can see the situation that you WANT to pick up background color, like usually when your color theme is dark, the syntax highlight will be light color. So if they are pasted without dark background, they would be hard to recognized. But it picked up all colored background regardless dark or light. So is that possible to make it pick up  highlight without background as default and make the background is an option for whoever needed? (I never need it tho)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21964","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21964/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21964/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21964/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21964","id":211862942,"number":21964,"title":"Perf:
