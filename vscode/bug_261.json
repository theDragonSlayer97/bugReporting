Install vscode as an administrator\r\n2. Launch vscode as a different (regular) user\r\n\r\nIt is currently not possible for an administrator to define mandatory and/or default settings that apply to all users/workspaces. This would be very helpful in a corporate/enterprise setting where we want users to have a consistent experience, or where the infrastructure demands certain configs (e.g. `\"update.channel\": \"none\"`).\r\n\r\nSuggestion:\r\na) Define an environment variable that points to a json file with mandatory settings, which override user/workspace settings.\r\nb) Define another environment variable that points to a json file with default settings, which get copied to the user settings file when a user launches vscode for the first time.\r\n\r\nIf suggestion a) is difficult to implement I will settle for b) and use an extension (e.g. [Fetch User Environment](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=michaelnewton.fetch-user-environment)) to manage the mandatory settings.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27972/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27971","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27971/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27971/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27971/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27971","id":233375073,"number":27971,"title":"Emmet:
