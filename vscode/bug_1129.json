was trying out Visual Studio recently and realized that it uses CSS Lint. As one of the creators of [stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint), I am writing to ask you to consider adding stylelint support, so Visual Studio users can take advantage of a more robust and active CSS linter. \n\nCSSLint was good for its time, but is limited and pretty much stagnant. With stylelint, we're trying to create a newer and better tool. stylelint is actively growing and very actively maintained; it is powered by [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss), a tool & ecosystem that is blowing up right now; and it has adopted many fantastic features from ESLint, like plugins, shareable configs, and custom reporters.  Because styelint uses PostCSS for parsing, it can handle any syntax that PostCSS can, which currently includes SCSS and potentially includes anything else, like Less and Stylus (when people build the parsers for them).\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about stylelint. Feedback on the project would also be appreciated.

thank you for great app.\n\nSo, I hope VS Code sets specified environment variables when it starts.\nI use a NodeJS Version Manager such as nvm, then a path to NodeJS is not added to `PATH` until nvm do it. (Also `NODE_PATH`, `NODE_HOME`, etc.)\nThat is, CLI of modules such as Gulp, Grunt, UglifyJS, etc. are not work as Task of VS Code. (VS Code can't find out these.)\n\nWhen I add to `PATH` a path to these CLIs such as `/path/to/nvm/v4.2.4` and call `code` command, these Tasks work fine. Or when I add a following line to `VS Code DIRECTORY/bin/code.js`.\n\n``` js\nprocess.env['PATH'] += require('path').delimiter + '/path/to/nvm/v4.2.4';\n```\n\nBut, When VS Code is started from launcher such as Windows Start Menu, these are not work because `Code.exe` is called directly.\n\nAs everyone knows, NodeJS is updated frequently. A better solution I think is that VS Code sets environment variables written in `settings.json` that was specified by user. Or user is given a chance such as \"Startup Script(or Command)\" to do something.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1895/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1894","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1894/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1894/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1894/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1894","id":125758776,"number":1894,"title":"Prevent code.cmd from being found in Start Menu search","user":{"login":"luchsamapparat","id":875017,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/875017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchsamapparat","html_url":"https://github.com/luchsamapparat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchsamapparat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchsamapparat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchsamapparat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchsamapparat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchsamapparat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchsamapparat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchsamapparat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchsamapparat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchsamapparat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-09T13:12:34Z","updated_at":"2016-01-09T13:19:33Z","closed_at":"2016-01-09T13:19:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Is there a way to prevent that the code.cmd is found when typing \"code\" in Windows 10's start menu?\n\nOf course both the \"Code\" shortcut and the cmd file open VS Code in the end.

`../config.json` should create json file in `./src/config.json` or path `./company/ford.ts` create `company` directory and then add `ford.ts` into that so finally we will have

related to:**\n- https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/6337\n- https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1032\n\n**Summary**\n`tsconfig.json` sometimes does not show up in VSCode's file list, nor does Typescript intellisense acknowledge it, despite its existence on disk. This behavior persists between VSCode restarts.\n\n**Behavior details**\nBegin on `branchA` with no changes. `branchB` has similar files to `branchA` including `tsconfig.json`, which is identical between both branches.\n\n```\ngit checkout branchB    // Checkout successful\ngit status              // shows no files changed.\n```\n\nVSCode gives me arcane errors about needing to specify the module flag for Typescript. `tsconfig.json` does not show up in the list of files in VSCode.\n\n```\nls                      // shows tsconfig.json\n```\n\nOpening a file explorer also shows `tsconfig.json`.\nI restart VSCode, `tsconfig.json` is still not listed in VSCode despite existing on the file system.\nI create a new `tsconfig.json` in VSCode. It lets me do it with no errors. `tsconfig.json` now finally shows up in VSCode. It's a blank file. Then:\n\n```\ngit status\n    On branch branchB\n    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/branchB'.\n    Changes not staged for commit:\n      (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n      (use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\n            modified:   tsconfig.json\n    no changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n```\n\nWeird, because `tsconfig.json` was unchanged before. Let me reset to the head again.\n\n```\ngit reset --hard HEAD\n   HEAD is now at 765b7b9 Some commit message\n```\n\nVSCode now updates `tsconfig.json` from disk properly and it's in the file list again.\n\n```\ngit status\n    On branch branchB\n    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/branchB'.\n    nothing to commit, working directory clean\n```\n\nOK, this is where I wanted to be in the first place.\n\nJust for good measure, I type some changes to let VSCode's Typescript intellisense do its thing. I delete the changes after a few seconds, and reassure myself with the following again:\n\n```\ngit status\n    On branch branchB\n    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/branchB'.\n    nothing to commit, working directory clean\n```\n\n`tsconfig.json` is still there. Good.\n\n```\ngit checkout branchA\n    Switched to branch 'branchA'\n    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/branchA'.\n```\n\n`tsconfig.json` is there. Looks fine.\n\n```\ngit checkout branchB\n    Switched to branch 'branchB'\n    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/branchB'.\n```\n\n`tsconfig.json` is again perfectly fine, as it should have always been. But I definitely witnessed the behavior detailed above.\n\n**Final thoughts**\nI can understand `tsserver.js` locking files causing problems, but not `tsconfig.json` completely disappearing from VSCode's file list _even after restarts_ when it is clearly there on the disk itself. It's like VSCode is completely ignoring `tsconfig.json`  _sometimes_.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1884","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1884/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1884/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1884/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1884","id":125663866,"number":1884,"title":"Status
