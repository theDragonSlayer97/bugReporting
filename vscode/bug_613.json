VSCode Version: 1.8\r\n- OS Version: Win10x64\r\n\r\nFirst of all thank you for this feature! No longer need I to nest projects and open multiple windows. But there is an inconvenience problem...\r\n\r\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/105338698/ShareX/2016-12/2016-12-16_17-10-28.gif)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Have a compound launch config with ['server', 'client']\r\n2. launch it\r\n3. restart 'server'\r\n\r\nDesired behavior: 'server' is still selected in target dropdown option list.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happens: 'client' gets selected\r\n\r\nWhy? Because the dropdown list removes the 'server' from the stack ->'client' becomes the only item so it gets selected -> new 'server' instance gets pushed into the list, but doesn't get reselected. If you restart once more - the same happens only with roles switched. They start to rotate.\r\n\r\nSo, if I'm used to restart via a hotkey - I normally don't look at what launch config is currently running - I just know it. If I'm now focused on the server-side development I probably want the selected target stay selected in the list because I want to restart it often. Without reselecting it manually every time.\r\n\r\nThank

VSCode Version: 1.8.0\r\n- OS Version: any\r\n\r\nImagine you have a language where you can have identifiers with spaces (for example T-SQL). \r\nIdentifiers with spaces are quoted, for example \"My Table\".\r\n\r\nI have a language server with code completion capabilities. When code completion is triggered, my language server returns a list of quoted identifiers, for example \"My Table\", \"Other Table\", etc.\r\n\r\nThen the user starts typing:\r\n- My -> completion list is narrowed down to one entry. This is done automatically by vscode in suggestModel.ts\r\n- Space -> completion is now cancelled by the suggest model. isDifferentContext returns true because it detects a space, [shouldRetrigger](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/6090d4b8ff89eefc91bdbec78dbd432a18a3562e/src/vs/editor/contrib/suggest/common/suggestModel.ts#L118-L121) returns false because it thinks it's a different line. But even if this line passes, re-triggering will happen only in automatic mode, but not in manual.\r\nAs a result, suggestion list is cancelled altogether and there is nothing one can do about it.\r\n\r\n@jrieken, what do you think about this scenario? Would it be possible to resolve this somehow? I can send more information from the language server, for example if \"My is typed, I know it's the part of identifier, so a subsequent space should keep filtering. Otherwise, if only My is typed, then space should probably cancel the suggestions as it does today. Then this would be similar to how Management Studio intellisense works.\r\n\r\nThis issue is quite annoying for our users because half of the identifiers in the codebase contains spaces
