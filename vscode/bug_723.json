VSCode Version: 1.6.1\n- OS Version: OSX 10.10.5\n\n**Feature Suggestion**\n1. The 'x' icon on the tab should be moved to the left (from right) so that its position is fixed relatively to the tab's origin (upper left corner), allowing users to close multiple tabs very quickly when the tab width are different.\n\n**How to Replicate the Issue**\n1. Create 8 dummy files with the file name length of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 characters.\n2. Open and view them all with VSCode, you should now have 8 tabs opened horizontally side by side with different tab width.\n3. Now starting from the left most tab, close each tab one by one VERY QUICKLY by clicking the 'x' icon on each tab.\n4. You will find that you have to reposition your mouse cursor on each tab in order to hit the 'x' icon, which is tedious. This is because the 'x' position is not fixed with relative to the tab origin (upper left corner).\n\n**Resolution**\n1. By relocating the 'x' to the left of the tab, the 'x' position is now fixed relative to the tab origin. You can close all tabs very quickly without having to reposition your mouse cursor when the tab width are different.\n2.

VSCode Version: all\n- OS Version: all\n\nHello,\n\nI'd like to know if it could be possible to add support for other CSS properties in the styleContributions code. Namely:\n- text-transform\n- text-decoration\n\n(and why not all the ones mentionned in http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_text.asp , but that might be overkill).\n\nFor example, I'd like to have support for capitalization via style in order to develop a syntax style that looks like the PICO-8 UI:\n\n![pico-8-code-300x298](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22177/19560911/b06c5466-96d6-11e6-8dd7-7dc4713e989a.png)\n\n(note that in the usual code, all text is actually typed as lowercase and displays as uppercase.)\n\nHowever the actual idea lies in the idea of supporting a slightly more extended set of css properties that could be customized via styles. This breaks the backward compatibility, though.\n\nI can provide a PR, if required.\n\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/services/themes/electron-browser/stylesContributions.ts#L120\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14082","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14082/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14082/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14082/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14082","id":184214912,"number":14082,"title":"Do
