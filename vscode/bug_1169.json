However I have one problem:\nWhen using ES6 features, like the arrow functions, I get the message \"This can only be used with ES6. Make sure to have a jsconfig.json-file which sets the target to ES6\".\n\nHowever I have a `jsconfig.json`-file in my root (the folder opened in Visual Studio Code), which contains:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"ES6\",\n        \"module\": \"commonjs\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe weird part is that I get it for some files, and not for others. Even if the files are in the same directory. Right now I have three files in the subdirectory `/app/bpm` names `bpm.js`, `bpmController.js` and `enterClick.js`. All three are written with ES6-functionality, but I only get the warning and red underlined text for `bpm.js`. \n\nUPDATE:\nI just restarted VS Code, and the red underline disappeared from `bpm.js` too. It was a new file I had created after the two others, however the red underline only went away after a restart.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/702","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/702/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/702/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/702/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/702","id":119013124,"number":702,"title":"[xml]
