My guess would be a zero length range is constructed on the line just after the start range for `content` but as we have `isWholeLine: true` on the decorations, the editor will color the line regardless. We should either a) Allow `IDocumentMergeConflictDescriptor.[block].content` to be empty or b) not inject the decoration if the `Range` has 0 length.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28367","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28367/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28367/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28367/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28367","id":234884000,"number":28367,"title":"[Language Server] \"Switch to document\" request handler should be added to the Document Request Handlers","user":{"login":"alexkrechik","id":5772406,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5772406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkrechik","html_url":"https://github.com/alexkrechik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkrechik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkrechik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkrechik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkrechik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkrechik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkrechik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkrechik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkrechik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexkrechik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-06-09T16:53:45Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T08:05:03Z","closed_at":"2017-06-15T08:05:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.13.0\r\n- OS Version: OSX 10.9.5\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nActually, there are no ability to do some action, when switch to some already opened document in Language Server.

This request doesn't have to do with IDE implementation._\r\n\r\nLet's say you have a boilerplate folder and that you're currently working on new projects (obviously all residing in a folder of their own), all using this boilerplate code as a starting point. These projects obviously have different code in them, but they are all founded on the boilerplate code you already worked on.  Suddenly you have the need to add features to that boilerplate code that you wish to implement in future projects, as well as the ones you're currently working on. You'd have to go back to that boilerplate folder, code the changes, and then do the same thing in all of the projects you're currently working on:  a complete hell.\r\n\r\nIt would be a great asset to have the ability to compare code from 2 different folders (project folders) so that we can assert how they differ, and therefore easily change what we need to in a way that helps to minimize code breaks.

[my conversion with vscode on twitter](https://twitter.com/VisualStudio/status/857683370435895296), I'll like to drop a request for/start a conversation around language support for Adobe ExtendScript. \r\n\r\nThe print industry (where I work) is incorporating more tech & automation, which often means scripting Adobe products like InDesign, Illustrator, & Photoshop. There is a dirth of support & tooling for Adobe's archaic version of javascript, ExtendScript, both from the community & Adobe itself. Right off the bat, their preferred `.jsx` extension gets confused with React/JSX.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the largest body of open source development in this space seems to be centered around this github org: https://github.com/ExtendScript/. Notable contributions from users like [Fabian MorÃ³n Zirfas](https://github.com/fabianmoronzirfas) & [bastienEichenberger](https://github.com/bastienEichenberger).\r\n\r\nAs someone just starting to dive in, I find Adobe's stock resources very difficult to consume. I've been hoping for a collection of official TypeScript typings for each environment so I could have intellisense autocompletion around the different environment globals and insight into the native object types. It's also very hard to go from writing esNEXT to the ExtendScript base of es3.\r\n\r\nDoes vscode have any language facilities for upgrading/downgrading a project/code window's referenced version of javascript? In other words, on a vscode window by window basis, can one switch from es2015 to es3? Or switch `/.jsx?$/` environments from browser (ECMAscript), to server (Node), to some other document type (Adobe ExtendScript, Google Docs scripting, etc.)?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Adobe needs to take the first steps towards enabling good DX and modern tooling. Perhaps issues like this & toolmakers like Microsoft can inspire some conversation or even break contact with Adobe?\r\n\r\n## TL;DR;\r\n- Adobe ExtendScript is ancient. It's based on es3 and has entirely different globals\r\n- Can vscode do anything to make the ExtendScript authoring experience better?\r\n  - Language environment switching for language version & env globals\r\n  - TypeScript typings for intellisense\r\n  - `.jsx` grammar (not React-style JSX)\r\n- Shot in the dark: can Microsoft use their voice to push Adobe to improve their automation tooling?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28352","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28352/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28352/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28352/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28352","id":234839966,"number":28352,"title":"Theming does not work","user":{"login":"johnroper100","id":9782943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9782943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnroper100","html_url":"https://github.com/johnroper100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnroper100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnroper100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnroper100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnroper100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnroper100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnroper100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnroper100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnroper100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnroper100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-06-09T14:14:18Z","updated_at":"2017-06-09T14:17:26Z","closed_at":"2017-06-09T14:17:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.13.0 (376c52b955428d205459bea6619fc161fc8faacf, 2017-06-08T16:43:13.058Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.15063\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|vscode-color|anseki|0.4.1|\r\n|path-intellisense|christian-kohler|1.4.2|\r\n|python|donjayamanne|0.6.4|\r\n|auto-close-tag|formulahendry|0.4.2|\r\n|auto-rename-tag|formulahendry|0.0.12|\r\n|Go|lukehoban|0.6.61|\r\n|cpptools|ms-vscode|0.11.4|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

Visual Studio and point them at the same folder.  Now a \"feature\" has been added to just switch to the existing Visual Studio.  I understand that there are split windows that I can use but this is not nearly as efficient for me as the two open studio sessions to the same folder.  My work around is to open the root folder in one session and the source folder in the second.  I would suggest that the check for an existing Visual Studio session needs to be removed as this is reducing the functionality.\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.  Open a folder with Visual Studio\r\n2.  press cntl-shft-n for a new window.\r\n3.  Open the same folder as the existing Visual Studio session.\r\n4.  The result is that the first Visual Studio Session is brought into focus and the new session is still blank.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28349/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28348","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28348/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28348/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28348/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28348","id":234832694,"number":28348,"title":"Hot

noticed that every window on startup has to go through IPC to the main side to ask for the backup folder location. I wonder why we are doing this? Wouldn't it be better we would create a window with the correct configuration and introduce a new `backupPath` property to send around?\r\n\r\nMy motivation for doing this change is to be able to restore UI state for windows that have dirty files but no folder associated. If we had the `backupPath` known upfront, we could use that one as UI state storage key because it is unique for each window that is opened.\r\n\r\n@Tyriar maybe you have a scenario that I did not see where we really need to go to the main side? I created a PR at https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/28350 which allows us to delete quite some code (e.g. backup IPC channels...)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28347","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28347/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28347/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28347/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28347","id":234831657,"number":28347,"title":"Breakpoint in Typescript stops debugger in Javascript (iOS Emulator)","user":{"login":"RobertGardner","id":1030572,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1030572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGardner","html_url":"https://github.com/RobertGardner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGardner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGardner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGardner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGardner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGardner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGardner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGardner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGardner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobertGardner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-09T13:45:40Z","updated_at":"2017-06-09T23:04:41Z","closed_at":"2017-06-09T23:04:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.13.0\r\n- OS Version: MacOS 10.12.5\r\n- XCode Version: 8.3.3\r\n- NativeScript Extension Version: 0.7.2\r\n- NativeScript CLI Version: 3.0.3\r\n\r\nI am writing a NativeScript app and running on XCode's iOS Emulator, using the NativeScript extension. When I debug, I can set a breakpoint in my TypeScript code, but when the debugger stops, it stops in the JS transpiled code and steps through that code. This happens on every app I try, including very small NativeScript \"HelloWorld\" samples.\r\n\r\nOn a clean Mac, I did a fresh install of VSCode, XCode, NativeScript and it debugged correctly in the .ts code. So there seems to be something strange about the installation on my Mac. I have completely uninstalled and reinstalled VSCode, XCode, and NativeScript on my Mac, but the problem still happens.\r\n\r\nAs suggested on other bug reports, I added \"trace\": \"sm\" to my launch config but I don't see any additional output in the debug console.\r\n\r\nThis has been happening on my Mac since I first started developing on this project, early this year, on older versions of VSCode and NativeScript.
