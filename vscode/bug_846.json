content will be opened into?\n\nI am trying to apply decorations to the provided content, but I haven't found a reliable (non-hack) way to get access to the opened editor. You can see my hack [here](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-git-codelens/blob/master/src/contentProvider.ts#L42)\n\nAlso is there any way to control the order of \"reference\" in the peek ui? I'm attempting to hijack that UI to provide git blame history but I can't control the order -- so it will be very confusing :)\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10378","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10378/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10378/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10378/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10378","id":170349957,"number":10378,"title":"Tabs vanish when using diff view","user":{"login":"buehler","id":1067213,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1067213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler","html_url":"https://github.com/buehler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buehler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":409283388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/caused-by-extension","name":"caused-by-extension","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-08-10T07:35:36Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T12:35:54Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T07:44:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: OS X 10.11.6\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
