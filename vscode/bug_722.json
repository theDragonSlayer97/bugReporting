for https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commit/b23229f65dd68c594915650e0e2aed722cdaa401\n\nI think you will run quickly into an issue where dirty files will not get restored in the way it works now because a user can decide to start code with a specific file to open or folder and you would not run into the `restoreEditor()` case and not reopen dirty files. \n\nI agree though that we should try to restore as much of the previous session state as possible to keep the user happy. \n\nThere are two cases:\n\n1.) the user just opens Code without passing in arguments. In that case the restoreEditors() call will restore all files and you are adding the untitled ones to have the complete picture.\n\n2.) the user opens code with a specific file in mind like so: `code.sh ~/Desktop/test-js/ ~/Desktop/test-js/package.json`. In this case we will not `restoreEditors()`. You will still need to massage the `filesToOpen` to include the backup files and you will also need to add the untitled files that contain dirty changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14130","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14130/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14130/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14130/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14130","id":184396834,"number":14130,"title":"A few error messages in my ts file","user":{"login":"zh-wowtv","id":18462946,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/18462946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zh-wowtv","html_url":"https://github.com/zh-wowtv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zh-wowtv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zh-wowtv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zh-wowtv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zh-wowtv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zh-wowtv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zh-wowtv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zh-wowtv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zh-wowtv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zh-wowtv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-10-21T04:26:11Z","updated_at":"2016-10-21T05:05:09Z","closed_at":"2016-10-21T04:47:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.6.1\n- OS Version: 10.11.6\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. `git clone https://github.com/bsliran/angular2-meteor-base.git demo`\n2.

VSCode Version: 1.7.0-insider\n- OS Version: Windows 8\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. bind `ctrl+down` and `ctrl+up` to `workbench.action.compareEditor.nextChange` and `workbench.action.compareEditor.previousChange` with `when` set to `textCompareEditorVisible`.\n2. open the git panel with some changes to view.\n3. _single_-click a file in the `CHANGES` list to select it and show its diff on the right.\n4. try hitting `ctrl+down` and/or `ctrl+up` to navigate the changes _while the git panel still has focus_.\n\nNavigating the file diff with `ctrl+down/up` used to work when single-clicking a file in the `CHANGES` list when this feature was first released. This broken sometime within the past several versions (I should've reported the regression sooner), and now you have to actually focus a file by double-clicking a `CHANGES` entry or manually clicking in one of the two displayed files on the right. This has become increasingly annoying enough that I finally remembered to make an issue about it :-)\n\nAnyway, please restore the previous behavior when you have a chance, as the `when` context name suggests it should merely be `visible` rather than `focused`! The feature was really nice and streamlined before, but has become a bottleneck now for us keyboard navigators. With the `CHANGES` list in continual focus, it was really nice to be able to `up/down` in the list to select files, and then `ctrl+up/down` to scan through their changes.\n\nThanks in advance!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14123","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14123/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14123/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14123/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14123","id":184345113,"number":14123,"title":"[typescript] VS Code won't use lib ES2015 type definitions","user":{"login":"ricokahler","id":10551026,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10551026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricokahler","html_url":"https://github.com/ricokahler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricokahler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricokahler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricokahler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricokahler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricokahler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricokahler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricokahler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricokahler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricokahler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-10-20T21:27:24Z","updated_at":"2016-10-21T19:46:42Z","closed_at":"2016-10-21T19:46:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm trying to use some ES2015 features (specifically `Object.assign`).\n\nSince typescript 2, [there is built in type definitions for ES2015 using the `--lib` option](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/What's-new-in-TypeScript#including-built-in-type-declarations-with---lib) and similarly, there is a `lib` `compilerOptions` key in the `tsconfig.json` file.\n\nI have the `lib` option changed to contain `es2015`.

VSCode Version: 1.6.1\n- OS Version: OSX\n\nRelated to #13623 . From that I learned that preview panes (virtual documents) have a 3 minute timer that clean ups unused virtual files. However, it appears as though this is attempting to clean up documents that are not closed, but simply not currently visible.\n\n[Open preview panes](http://imgur.com/MnaR597)\n\n[onDidCloseTextEditor triggering for a preview pane I have open](http://imgur.com/ZYhPbfW)\n\nThis is a problem because this means we can not trust this onDidCloseTextDocument event in order to know when to clean up data, meaning we have to hold on to data forever. Is this expected behavior? Is there a `vscode.window.visibleTextEditors` but for all open files so we can check to see if a html pane has actually been closed?\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open two html preview panes\n2. Wait for the three minute clean up to trigger and on did close document will trigger for a document you already have open but not visible.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14117","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14117/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14117/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14117/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14117","id":184316520,"number":14117,"title":"Settings

I did figure out that I can see the same error in the debug console. It would be better if there was a way to see the complete message in the error box. (ping @bgashler1 @stevencl on this one)\n2 - I would've expected to have caught this with the JSON validation of the file. We should introduce a squiggle line indicating that the keybinding object is missing a required `\"key\"` property. \n3 - The error message should indicate the line number where the issue exists. See the debug console error message below does not give me an indication where the problem is.

Studio Community Edition is a free editor and I work with it on desktop.\n\nSo the purpose of VS Code should be to open code files in server enviroments, or PC's without VS Installed.\nIt should be like notepad++ does but with full syntax support.\n\nIt is great but it still takes 10 seconds to start up on a fast PC. I think you should load less necessary features on demand.\n\nAlso I need to be able to start and debug a sln or csprj file. It just displays me inner xml, no run button.\nSo I get no useful feature of IDE.
