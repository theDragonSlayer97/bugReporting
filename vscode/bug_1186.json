pressing the mouse button down then holding control and then releasing the mouse button, VS Code jumps to the definition. This should only happen if you are holding down CTRL before the mouse down.\n\nOne of the problems this causes: When selecting text and copying/cutting/pasting it via CTRL+X/C/V you have to be sure to let go of the mouse button before you press CTRL.\n\nAnother issue with CTRL is that when navigating through recent files with CTRL+TAB and you go backwards in the list via CTRL+SHIFT+TAB, but then decide you actually didn't need to go backwards: You release SHIFT and get immediately thrown into the currently selected file. I think this should only happen when letting go of CTRL in that case.\n\nIn my opinion the Jump To Definition probably shouldn't happen regardless of modifier keys pressed when you have a text selection created with that mouse action.\n\n(this was reported in https://code.visualstudio.com/issues/detail/18527, but I guess github issues are the way forward, right?!)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/188","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/188/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/188/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/188/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/188","id":117777539,"number":188,"title":"Format action in XML files deletes spaces in content","user":{"login":"davity","id":1507332,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1507332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davity","html_url":"https://github.com/davity","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davity/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davity/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davity/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davity/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davity/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davity/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davity/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davity/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davity/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-11-19T09:48:39Z","updated_at":"2015-11-19T15:16:58Z","closed_at":"2015-11-19T15:16:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When you format an XML file, every group of more than one space is replaced by only one.
