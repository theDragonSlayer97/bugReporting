know this is an extreme case but I would be happy if this was fixed. I use [hyperdock](https://bahoom.com/hyperdock/) to bring the snapping window functionality that windows has to mac. Only vscode doesn't respect the snapping feature. I am not exactly sure after which update this issue started, but as far as I know it started after the titlebar got its custom look.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.8.1\r\n- OS Version: MacOS Sierra 10.12.2\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download [hyperdock](https://bahoom.com/hyperdock/) . It is free to try, you can download to reproduce the bug\r\n2. Snap other windows like your web browser etc to make sure it's working\r\n3. Try snapping vscode to a side. It won't work\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18971/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18970","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18970/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18970/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18970/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18970","id":202310318,"number":18970,"title":"Extension
