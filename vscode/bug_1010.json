VSCode Version: 1.0.0-alpha\n- OS Version: Windows10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Launch VSCode and open a folder which contains .ts project.\n2. Set configuration for launch.json (sourceMaps : 'true') and tasks.json.\n3. Perform build with CTRL+SHIFT+B and verify app.js is generated.\n4. Now set break point to app.ts and start debugging.\n5. Keep debugging with F10 and verify debug pointer.\n\nActual: Looks like debug pointer is not referring latest code and highlighting the blank line while debugging.\nExpected: Debugger should not highlight the blank line.\n\nYou can refer the sample project from : v-pavanp/ForTestingCode@ 551ea09 \n\n![debugpointer
