@jrieken \n\nWe'd like to avoid this:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22350/16307816/f2ca05b4-3962-11e6-8356-e93b20ad521d.png)\n\nFor that I'd like to close all extension resources when the viewlet goes away. I tried doing it through the `setVisible` call and through the `IEventService`... but both approaches fail when the sidebar simply closes: the extensions shouldn't go away on that situation. I need an event for when _another_ viewlet opens, and I couldn't find it.\n\n@bpasero need your help here.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8059","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8059/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8059/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8059/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/8059","id":161936966,"number":8059,"title":"refine

This is achievable in vscode and everything works brilliantly until you attempt to debug.\n\nIt doesn't seem possible in vscode currently to debug a web app under this setup (problems locating source code due to limitations in conf files), or to place breakpoints within the web app itself as well as class libraries to follow execution when debugging.\n\nThis seems like a pretty critical requirement for any mid-large sized project, and is a hurdle to being able to migrate to using vscode for projects (on a mac, in my case) from vs.net.\n\nI have been discussing this problem on stack overflow looking for possible solutions:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/37376415/debugging-in-vscode-with-multiple-dotnet-core-projects-under-one-solution \n\nAnd also in the comments here on a blog post about setting up multiple projects under one roof in vscode: \nhttp://forums.dotnetfoundation.org/t/referencing-another-project-in-net-core/1298/9\n\nWhere you can find more information on my attempts to achieve this functionality should it be helpful.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8051","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8051/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8051/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8051/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8051","id":161917942,"number":8051,"title":"Allow Windows cmd / Powershell to run as administrator","user":{"login":"jtsom","id":13488,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom","html_url":"https://github.com/jtsom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtsom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-06-23T13:05:31Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T19:59:36Z","closed_at":"2016-07-05T19:55:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code -

Using `shift + up` to select multiple lines rolls over into the code screen rather than scrolling the console. \n2. If I select a line and then manually scroll up through many lines while holding shift and then click the new line (10 or so lines higher - they don;t all fit on the screen) however, scrolling up and down shows them highlighted, copy and paste only shows the last 4 lines (presumably the only ones that were visible at one go).
