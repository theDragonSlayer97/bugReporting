VSCode Version: 1.8.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. In `a.ts`, export a function type:\r\n```typescript\r\nexport interface MyFunctionType {\r\n    (): string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. In `b.ts`, import the type and export a variable which implements it\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {MyFunctionType} from \"./a\";\r\nexport function MyFunction: MyFunctionType = () => {\r\n    return \"test\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3.
