That last isn't very clear on if it's supported but seems to imply that just adding the `/**  Some summary doc. */` should work, as I've done in the repro. \r\n\r\nConsider this a feature request if it's not implemented or tell me which to vote up, please. I really would like to provide some doc guidance for the shared components we have and have it show up there. Related: it'd be awesome to surface the specific JSX properties I specify at the top of the list so it's more obvious what the props are, not to mention showing right after `<MyComponent` + spacebar.  (Again, plz advise if this is an existing request.
