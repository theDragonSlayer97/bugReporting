So, what I would do mouse over the `Navigator` icon and it would open, then say I click on `Method`, it would then navigate to the correct line where that `Method` is defined. Once I moused off of the viewlet it would then close and my `Files` viewlet would come back (or whatever one I had opened prior to the mouseover).\n\n**Edit**\n\nThis would also be helpful when the
