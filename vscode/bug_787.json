Using a keyboard that has a keypad (large laptop in my case), try zooming with ctrl and the keypad plus/minus. This works in Firefox and many other applications as an alternative to the -/= keys between 0 and backspace on a US keyboard.\n2. I think this should be doable with custom keybindings ala https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/keybindings but I haven't quite managed to get that working. This might be a standard and useful enough binding for these keys that it would be worth making default though?
