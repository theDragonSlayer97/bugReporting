autofetch makes auth popups come up on many users' machines. These popups come out of nowhere and don't indicate that their existence is due to Code spawning `git fetch`. AFAIK it is not possible to detect whether a `git fetch` will cause a popup to appear, since it depends on the user's configuration.\r\n\r\nMany users have already expressed their will to have autofetch disabled by default simply because such a default enabled setting is _too magic_.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I keep getting ~10 issues per iteration in which I have to, yet again, explain the nature of the mysterious popup to surprised users.\r\n\r\nI intend to disable autofetch by default due to this. The consequence is, of course, that the incoming changes won't be automatically updated any more by default, unless you enable the setting.\r\n\r\nWe can also introduce a one-time popup which prompts the user if he wants to enable autofetch in case a successful sync has happened, which is a good sign that proper credentials are configured.\r\n\r\n@Microsoft/vscode,

up on #34597 and #34595, as part of #33555\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\n#33555 describes a few key issues with using code actions for refactorings. Along with these concerns, we'd also like to be able to do the following:\r\n\r\n- Sort code actions so that fixes for errors show up first\r\n- Group code actions by type / by the error they fix\r\n- Provide a better UI for code actions that tells users which actions address which problems in the code\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\nThis proposal subsumes the proposals of #34597 and #34595 and is based on discussions @kieferrm and I had. It is based on the following observations:\r\n\r\n- The semantics of when we want to show quick fixes vs refactorings is different. The automatic lightbulb does not make as much sense for refactorings\r\n- However the API and implementation of quick fixes and refactorings will be very similar. \r\n\r\nThis proposal extends the CodeAction API to let us differentiate between quick fixes and refactorings. Using this, we can then specialized the UX for each of theses\r\n\r\n**VS Code API Changes**\r\n```ts\r\n/**\r\n *  New enum that identifies the type of a code action\r\n */\r\nenum class CodeActionType {\r\n    // Standard type. Would be used for existing CodeActionProviders that return Commands\r\n    Default = 0 ,\r\n\r\n    // Fixes a diagnostic from the CodeActionContext\r\n    QuickFix = 1,    \r\n\r\n    // Perform a refactorng\r\n    Refactoring = 2\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * New interface that provides additional info about a code action \r\n */\r\ninterface CodeAction {\r\n    // Command the performs the action\r\n    // In later iterations we could change this to be a `string | WorkspaceEdit`\r\n    action: string\r\n    \r\n    // Title of the action \r\n    // The reason we don't just use the `Command` type here is that we will likely want\r\n    // to support `WorkspaceEdit` as a future option for action\r\n    title: string\r\n\r\n    // Type of the action\r\n    type: CodeActionType\r\n\r\n    // List of diagnostics this code action resolves\r\n    addresses?: Diagnostic[]\r\n   \r\n    // Identifier for the action, such as `\"extract method\"`\r\n    // This would be used for creating keybinding for specific code actions\r\n    id?: string\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Add a new `requestedTypes` field to the `CodeActionContext`\r\n */\r\nexport interface CodeActionContext {\r\n    readonly diagnostics: Diagnostic[]\r\n\r\n    // List of types to compute.\r\n    // Any code actions that are returned that are not in the list will also be filtered out by vscode\r\n    readonly requestedTypes: CodeActionType[]\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Update the `CodeActionProvider` to either return `Commands` or `CodeActions`\r\n */\r\nexport interface CodeActionProvider {\r\n\tprovideCodeActions(document: TextDocument, range: Range, context: CodeActionContext, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<Command[] | CodeAction[]>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Code action context menu UX changes**\r\nUsing the additional information provided by the new `CodeAction` interface, we would update the code action context menu to display the following:\r\n\r\n- Add a symbol next to next each code action in the context menu. These symbols would use the `CodeActionType` to differentiate types of code actions.\r\n- In the case of `QuickFix` code actions, also use diagnostic severity to display a different symbol for quick fixes for errors and quick fixes for warnings\r\n- Sort the code actions so that fixes for errors show up first\r\n- Surface information about the diagnostic that a code action fixes in the menu\r\n\r\n\r\n**Code action trigger changes**\r\nUsing the `CodeActionType`, we can now differentiate quick fixes and refactorings. We would then change when we show each type:\r\n\r\n1. The existing lightbulb / `editor.action.quickFix` would request code actions with `CodeActionType.Standard` and `CodeActionType.QuickFix`. Refactoring code actions would be filtered out.\r\n\r\n2. A new `editor.action.refactor`command  would request code actions only of `CodeActionType.Refactor` and display these in the context menu\r\n\r\n\r\n**Keybinding for code actions**\r\nIntroduce a new `editor.action.codeAction` command. This command would take an optional list of code action ids.\r\n\r\nWhen the command is triggered, it would request all code actions that are currently available, but only show those that match the requested `ids`. If only a single code action matches the id, it would be applied automatically\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to setup keybindings such as:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"key\": \"cmd+r cmd+e\",\r\n\t\"command\": \"editor.action.codeAction\",\r\n\t\"args\": [\r\n\t\t\"extract method\"\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4514","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"CA1A:366F:C2A239:17B5CE1:59D931B4","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=39>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=37>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"bc481687fcc398f8afd40ad3b6717903\"","status":"200 OK"}}
