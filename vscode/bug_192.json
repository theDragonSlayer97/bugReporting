I know this is a _personal taste_, but the new UI is taking too much atention while looking for commands. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I prefer the original UI (just a label) but I understand the new UI (apply the same UI from the Keyboard Shortcut editor). I didn't find any `User Setting` to choose the UI, but it would be great to have that, or maybe make some changes in the new UI to keep focus in the commands, not the keybindings.\r\n\r\nHere is a quick compare:\r\n\r\n![command-palette-keybinding-july-insiders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3781424/27799812-099ad244-5fed-11e7-9a55-d6057b9f84fc.png)\r\n\r\nThanks in

PR is to fix a problem I noticed when I created https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/29964 \r\n\r\nThe problem is visible in this video. Note: The same issue occurs when using code in the desktop, this recording is from when I was testing for Sourcegraph\r\n\r\n![demo](https://cl.ly/2j2U13143F1N/Screen%20Recording%202017-06-30%20at%2005.05%20pm.gif)\r\n\r\nNote how when I expand a folder we have children (a FileMatch) with an icon indicating they are expanded, but the children are not rendered. They get rendered if one collapses FileMatch and then expands. Note: the affected FileMatches are marked as auto expanded, which I believe is somehow related to the root cause of this bug.\r\n\r\nThe more generic explanation of the issue: If an item is auto-expanded but its parent is not, then when the parent is expanded the item's children are not refreshed. This fix we always recursively refresh. This fix seems a bit heavy handed and potentially a performance regression. So I'd like some guidance.\r\n\r\ncc @bpasero
