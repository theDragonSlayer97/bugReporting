https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/931\r\n\r\nHere's how things got this way:\r\n\r\n1. Windows API requires the `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN` flag when calling [`CreateFile`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363858(v=vs.85).aspx) on a hidden file if `CREATE_ALWAYS` is specified.\r\n2. Microsoft C run-time library never uses this flag, consequently `fopen` in `w` mode fails on hidden files.\r\n3. libuv follows MS CRT's behavior on Windows and fails with `UV_EPERM` when `uv_fs_open` is called with `O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC` (aka \"w\") on a hidden file.\r\n4. Node.js uses `uv_fs_open` to implement `fs.open` and thus fails with `EPERM` when trying to open a hidden file with `flags='w'`.\r\n5. Visual Studio Code opens the file with `flags='w'` when saving a file, which [fails on hidden files](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/931). We've gone full circle.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses `r+` when opening existing files and truncates them. We can't do it just for hidden files since Node.js doesn't provide an API to query the hiddenness of a file. We also can't do it for all files since `r+` fails if the file doesn't exist.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31732","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31732/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31732/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31732/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/31732","id":246601902,"number":31732,"title":"Remove

as:\r\n```\r\n[diff]\r\n  tool = vs_code\r\n[difftool]\r\n  prompt = false\r\n[difftool \"vs_code\"]\r\n  cmd = code --wait --diff \\\"$LOCAL\\\" \\\"$REMOTE\\\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a sample repository which contains: one new, one removed and one edited file. All those files are added to the index.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In an external console, just type: `$ git difftool --cached`\r\n2. An existing and modified files will display in two column diff - as expected.\r\n3. Added file will display as just opened file - nothing indicates it is a diff's window.\r\n4. Removed file displays also like opened file, but with strange name suffix (from Git?) - also hard to spot as diff.\r\n\r\n![diff-new deleted](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3832797/28753568-74b3807c-7536-11e7-9249-b50693419209.png)\r\n\r\nI would expect that new or removed files will be display with empty left or right column respectively. New file has not any previous version, so left side of diff is empty. Deleted file has not any future version, so current version (right side of diff) should be empty.\r\n\r\nAlso I do not understand why we have to run VS Code with a `--wait` flag for diff, and block Git until VS Code window was closed. Without the flag: `--wait`, Git could open multiple VS Code's tabs (with a flag: `--reuse-window`), so I could start difftool and then go for a coffee and then just see all changes without wait for open every instance of VS Code. But `--diff` without `--wait` does not work at all: modified files are displayed in separated tabs without the _diff view_ and new or deleted files behave as described in this issue.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31725","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31725/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31725/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31725/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31725","id":246575517,"number":31725,"title":"Not able to run test for .net core in vs code","user":{"login":"d-saravanan","id":20381669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/20381669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-saravanan","html_url":"https://github.com/d-saravanan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-saravanan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-saravanan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-saravanan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-saravanan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-saravanan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-saravanan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-saravanan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-saravanan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-saravanan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-07-30T10:25:45Z","updated_at":"2017-07-31T18:01:08Z","closed_at":"2017-07-31T18:01:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have the source code for aspnet security github repo.\r\n\r\nInstalled new version of VS Code\r\nTried to build > Succeeded\r\nWhen running test case, getting the following errror\r\n\r\n\r\nTesthost process exited with error: It was not possible to find any compatible framework version\r\nThe specified framework 'Microsoft.NETCore.App', version '2.0.0' was not found.\r\n  - Check application dependencies and target a framework version installed at:\r\n      \\\r\n  - Alternatively, install the framework version '2.0.0'.\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal tests: 0.

Imagine putting each file on your desktop in its own folder. That's what this feels like^^\r\n\r\nHere are some suggestions for customizations I would like:\r\n\r\nMake an option to completely disable grouping references a collapsed folder. So instead of having the list look like this:\r\n```\r\nFile1.cs                               (1)\r\n   some reference\r\nFile2.cs                               (1)\r\n   another reference\r\n   third reference\r\n```\r\nI would prefer it if it looked like this:\r\n```\r\nsome reference                  File1.cs (19)\r\nanother reference               File2.cs (13)\r\nthird reference                 File2.cs (47)\r\n```\r\nThen I would be able to just browse using only the arrow up and down keys, without thinking about what files to expand first.\r\n\r\nI also wish there was a non-inline mode for it. \r\n\r\nThere are many cases where I'm not interested in seeing or browsing the code of all the references. I just want to know, does x file have references to it or not.  And the window shows up, in line. pushing the code down I'm looking at, and showing new code which I'm not interested in seeing is super annoying.\r\n\r\nA mode where it would casually show up to the right as a list would be great. And instead of drawing the preview in line, it would open a new tab as soon as I've clicked the arrow down/up key, and use that tab as the preview window as I browse the list. Hitting escape would then close it, and take me back to where I came from. And hitting return open the tab for real.\r\n\r\nThe list showing up to the right would also improve the overview a great deal as you would be able to view take up all the space vertically and view more of the list at once.
