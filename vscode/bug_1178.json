I tried the very first public release of VCS, I was able to both zoom in and out from the initial zoom.\n\nMy personal preferred zoom level is around 90%; I like content to be as dense as possible as long as I can still read the fonts, that way I can fit more windows/information on a screen at at time.\n\nAn update from a few months ago changed it so I could only zoom in, but not zoom out past the default zoom level.\n\nNow that the source code is available, I've looked into why that happens and found this comment in [src/vs/workbench/electron-browser/actions.ts#L169](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/bff376d1388d40050aaabf9ec96101a427b506de/src/vs/workbench/electron-browser/actions.ts#L169):\n\n```

because it results in blurryness\n    }\n...\n}\n```\n\nI'm opening this issue to track this issue (I did not find any existing open issues tracking this specific problem), because I'd really like to see it resolved so I can use 90% zoom level.
