it supports all use cases, the current solution seems far from optimal, especially considering the architecture changes it creates and its implementation.\n\nWe started off the story by saying _we want to support disabling extensions globally and per workspace_. We figured out user settings were not the best place for that since workspace settings are usually checked into SCM. At the same time we decided that we want the files to be manually edited by the user. That excluded the storage service. A new concept was needed of global storage (`extensions.json`) that the user could edit by hand.\n\nThis introduced a [new method](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/node/storage.ts#L199) in the storage service which creates a bit of debt. Its implementation is also _way_ far from optimal: it's filled with synchronous IO calls. We definitely don't want to do that.\n\nLater this week we decided to do UI for disablement. This drops the requirement for having the files be user-editable. We don't need this new storage concept anymore.\n\nI suggest to take a step back and simply store the disablement state in the `IStorageService` available to the renderer, removing the newly introduced storage concept.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13733","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13733/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13733/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13733/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13733","id":182980911,"number":13733,"title":"Hot

It seems goods, but\n- The file1.php have no information I needed then I close this file and intended to open file2.php in the folder /path/path.
