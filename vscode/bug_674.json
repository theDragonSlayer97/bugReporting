It's always the \"--type=watcherService\" process. It even happens with --extensions-disabled\r\n\r\ntop output:\r\n```\r\n  PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND     \r\n29275 ivo       20   0 2546512 1,579g  33836 R 115,3 10,1   2:36.30 code  \r\n```\r\n\r\nps output:\r\n```\r\nivo      29275  115 10.1 2588532 1667120 ?

There's no need to watch these files and watching all of them could very well cause the problem.\r\n\r\nAfter removing tmp/ entirely the problem disappeared. After filling tmp/ again with about 20 copies of itself (resulting in appr. 400.000 files), the problem reappeared. And after removing the issue is gone again.\r\n\r\nThis happens even with \r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"files.exclude\": {\r\n        \"tmp/\": true\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nConclusion: could it be the watcherService ignores `files.exclude` and tmp/ folders in general and will happily attempt to monitor 400K+ files?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15571","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15571/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15571/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15571/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15571","id":189731641,"number":15571,"title":"getting

Motivation\r\nI was looking for extension that enables working with `node_modules` in way that looks like it done in Visual Studio:\r\n![solution explorer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15427508/20345514/c3ba8c8c-abf7-11e6-87d8-fc679412749b.png)\r\nAnd I haven't found any. Then I investigated `vscode API` and realized that there is no way provided for extending File Explorer, so I can't create such extension also.\r\n## What this feature offers?\r\nThis API could be useful for providing a way to restructure appearance of files and folders in File Explorer in order to organize it in more useful way depending on platform. It also could be used for extensions that change file appearance e.g. makes one folder-like group from `file.ts`, `file.js`, `file.d.ts`, `file.js.map`.\r\n## Implementation ideas\r\nI'm not very familiar with `vscode API` for now, but it seems that it could be reached by adding API for registering function that looks like this:\r\n```TypeScript\r\nTransformFolderStructure(structure: IFolderStructure): IFolderStructure\r\n```\r\nwhich would be called by vscode, when folder structure changed. And because of that this function has same return type as argument type, we are able to apply several transform functions, where each one uses result of previous. So in most cases different extensions that uses this API wouldn't conflict.\r\n## P.S.\r\nIf this idea doesn't conflict with plans of vscode team, I would love to participate in its implementation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15564","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15564/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15564/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15564/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/15564","id":189660821,"number":15564,"title":"Include

real line in half – the way moving up/down in the editor treats those wrapped lines as real lines anyway, so the implementation is at least consistent.\r\n\r\nIf the day comes where this movement
