install type definition files. Currently we try to pick up npm from the PATH. There are a number of cases where we end up not being able to find a npm executable on the PATH\r\n\r\nVScode 1.13 adds a new `typescript.npm` setting that you can use to  explicitly tell VSCode/TypeScript where npm is installed\r\n\r\n\r\n## Prep\r\n- Make sure npm is not on your PATH\r\n\r\n  One option for this is to simple rename or move the npm executable. Try running `which npm` to see where your npm executable currently is\r\n\r\n- Clear the typings cache\r\n\r\n  This is located at `~/.cache/typescript/` on linux, `~/Library/caches/typescript` on mac and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\TypeScript` on windows: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40941447/where-are-automatic-type-acquisition-typescript-definition-files-saved\r\n\r\n- Make sure you don't have other VSCode instances running that may try to repopulate the typings cache\r\n\r\n- Test that npm cannot be found\r\n\r\n  Boot up vscode. Create a new js file with the contents `const $ = require('jquery')`. You should see a warning  about missing npm. There should be no intellisense for jquery.  If you get intellisense on the jquery import, either npm is still on your path or the cache has not been cleared\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Set `typescript.npm` to point to a valid npm executable somewhere on your system.\r\n- Open a js file with some imports that are known to have typings, such as `const $ = require('jquery')`\r\n- You should now see a message in the status bar about acquiring typings.\r\n- Check that you get intellisense on the imports\r\n- Try adding some other imports and ensure you get intellisense for those as well.\r\n- Try changing `typescript.npm` to different values and triggering typings installs again\r\n\r\nAlso confirm that you cannot set `typescript.npm` in a workspace. It should only be allowed as a user setting","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27694","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27694/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27694/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27694/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27694","id":232473971,"number":27694,"title":"Empty
