vscode,\r\n\r\nI wanted to ask about MacOS Sierra's tab support for applications - from Apple marketing, we hear that tabs for applications should \"just work\".\r\n\r\nFor some applications, when multiple windows are open, the option appears in the menu bar under Window -> Merge All Windows. It would be awesome to manage multiple Code windows in this way, if the implementation is a config change or similar.\r\n\r\nThis is slightly related to #396, but ultimately serves a different purpose.\r\n\r\nEDIT: While using the application, I realized that Cmd+Opt+Shift+N is actually able to create a new tab today - perhaps there is no extra work needed after all!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15478/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15477","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15477/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15477/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15477/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15477","id":189189502,"number":15477,"title":"Support
