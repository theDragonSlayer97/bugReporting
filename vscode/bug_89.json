Ručne je potreba presunúť kurzor do správnej pozície. V prípade niektorých suggestií to radí nezmysli, ako napr. \"<img <source>\".\r\n\r\nProsím opravte to, ať to funguje ako vo verzii 1.11, prípadne ešte lepšie to fungovalo v staršej verzii kde aj po \"<script src=\"\"><|\" suggescia bola </script>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[translate to EN from CZ/SK] : [by Google Translator]\r\n\r\ndescription:\r\n\r\nIn version 1.11, everything works correctly, in the case of Emmet confirmation or \"suggestions\", the cursor moves to the highlighted area (target cursor).\r\n\r\nBut in newer versions it does not work anymore, the newer version the worse ... for example emmet confirmation creates a new line instead of confirmation. You need to manually move the cursor to the correct position. For some suggestions, it does not seem like, \"<Img <source>\".\r\n\r\nPlease fix it to work as in version 1.11, or even better it worked in an older version where even after \"<script src =\" \">
