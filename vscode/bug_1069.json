have a few mocha tests that need to exercise some ES6 code which is normally targeted for the browser. I'm using babel through webpack to manage packaging this up on the fly using [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html). In order to support running the tests in node I've opted to use the `--compilers js:babel-core/register` option with mocha to allow dynamic compiling of the ES5 tests and their imports. I've followed advice given for other related issues by trying to precompile the source, ensuring I have source maps enabled, and setting `outDir` as needed in the `launch.json` file but I'm still not getting good results. I've also made sure that my [path doesn't contain any spaces](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3667). I've also tried various forms source maps (inline, both, true, ...). Eventually when letting the test run through an error is hit but error shows is a line that appears to be the transpiled code as opposed to the original source.\n\nMy launch configuration:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"name\": \"Test\",\n    \"type\": \"node\",\n    \"request\": \"launch\",\n    \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha\",\n    \"stopOnEntry\": false,\n
