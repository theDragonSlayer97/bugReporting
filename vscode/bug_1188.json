use VS Code daily at work and at home since the very first preview release and I love it.\n\nI do have a major concern though about the way the differents files are shown in the 'Working Folder' view : they're all formatted in the same, plain way, and it is actually quite hard to distinguish what is what when looking at it (especially folders vs files). In a previous release, I recall the folder names were bold. It was better but nonetheless not enough.\n\nI think this image below can describe pretty well what I suggest:\n![folderview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3266897/11257610/fe34751c-8e52-11e5-9a98-7d7302611ddf.png)\nThe same solution is opened in both Code and full VS, and obviously the latter works way better with icons and varying font weight.\n\nWould it be possible to achieve a similar look with Code ? I don't know about reusing the full VS assets since it might be a problem with licensing and stuff though. I gave a look at the new extension API but it specifically states that it doesn't allow for DOM manipulation, so I guess it's a no-go.\n\nIf it's not in the priorities of the dev team (I understand there are way more important stuff to work on in the short term), would you accept a PR that would bring such a feature ?\n\nThank you for your time and your awesome work,\nJabX\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/123/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/122","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/122/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/122/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/122/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/122","id":117704638,"number":122,"title":"Regression:

Arch Linux with Gnome/Gtk+ 3.18.\n\nIn versions 0.9.2 and below, VS Code ignored the text scaling factor in Gnome 3 and rendered its UI text at 100% scale instead of 125% as I had set. (The text scaling factor can be set with gnome-tweak-tool.) To compensate, I set the editor text size to 17, which worked fine.\n\nAs of 0.10.1, VS Code now seems to respect the text scaling factor.
