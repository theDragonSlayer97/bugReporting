would be very helpful for somebody attempting to sync config files between multiple machines if VSCode supported some system for having multiple config files included at a time.\r\n\r\n### Benefits:\r\n\r\nImagine a config folder structure like this on a developer's mac:\r\n```\r\n- settings.json -> ~/Drive/dotfiles/settings.json\r\n- settings.local.json -> ~/Drive/dotfiles/settings.my-mac.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then like this on a developer's linux desktop:\r\n```\r\n- settings.json -> ~/Drive/dotfiles/settings.json\r\n- settings.local.json -> ~/Drive/dotfiles/settings.my-arch.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing symlinks, then, a developer would be able to have specialized configuration files for each computer, while keeping the vast majority of options synced between both.\r\n\r\n### Implementation:\r\n\r\nI can think of two simple ways to implement this with as little friction as possible.\r\n\r\n1) An `editor.includeConfig` option in the main `settings.json` \r\nThis might be a JSON array, with support for various different config files. It could also just be a single field. \r\nWhether or not the option should be recursive is up to the VSCode team.\r\n2) VSCode searches for all config files in the directory matching `settings[.foo].json` and includes those.\r\n\r\n### Conflicts:\r\nIf going with option (1) above, conflicting config entries should take precedence the later they appear in the `includeConfig` array.\r\n\r\nIf going with option (2), the main `settings.json` file should take precendence.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17634/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17633","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17633/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17633/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17633/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17633","id":196825335,"number":17633,"title":"add
