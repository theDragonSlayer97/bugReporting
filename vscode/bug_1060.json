more complex key chords, it would be incredibly helpful to have \"suggested\" completions, based on the first element of the chord. For example, consider the following complicated workflow:\n1. You type `CMD + K`\n2. Visual Studio Code waits for the next key of the chord (but doesn't tell you what valid options could be typed)\n3. User forgets or doesn't know the shortcut he wants, so he hits `ESCAPE` \n4. User hits `F1` to search for the desired command and keyboard shortcut\n5. User hits `ESCAPE`\n6. User executes keyboard shortcut\n\nInstead, what should happen is that VS Code should show the users all of the key chords (or perhaps most commonly used commands _by that specific user_, based on telemetry data), that could possibly be pressed.\n\nThis would have the following benefits:\n- Significantly improve the user experience\n- Ease the learning of new keyboard shortcuts\n- Tailor the Visual Studio Code environment to each user (optional)\n\nCheers,\nTrevor Sullivan\nMicrosoft MVP: PowerShell\nhttps://trevorsullivan.net\nhttps://twitter.com/pcgeek86\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3969/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3968","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3968/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3968/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3968/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3968","id":139943421,"number":3968,"title":"Missing \"focus\" command to focus on the project","user":{"login":"pcgeek86","id":466713,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/466713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcgeek86","html_url":"https://github.com/pcgeek86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcgeek86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcgeek86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcgeek86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcgeek86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcgeek86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcgeek86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcgeek86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcgeek86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcgeek86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-03-10T16:35:48Z","updated_at":"2016-03-11T06:13:16Z","closed_at":"2016-03-11T06:13:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"There's options for _View: Focus into Side Bar_ and _View: Focus on Working Files_, but there isn't any option for _View: Focus into Open Project_.

is an odd set of circumstances, but it causes v10.10 to crash (on Windows), and it didn't in 10.8, so I'll report it anyway. I was experiencing a lot of crashes while developing autocomplete in an extension, and found that it boiled down to this:\n\nIf an extension provides a _LanguageConfiguration_ with a _wordPattern_ that can match an empty string (eg `/\\w*/`), and it then registers a _CompletionItemProvider_ that provides no completion items (an empty array): the intellisense will show \"Loading...\" for about 10 seconds, then vscode will crash.\n\nHere's example code ([full sample attached](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/167431/abc-completionitems.zip)). This extension creates a new language \"abc\" with extension \".abc\".\n\n``` ts\nimport * as vscode from 'vscode';\nimport { TextDocument, Position, CancellationToken, CompletionItem, languages } from 'vscode';\n\nconst languageConfiguration: vscode.LanguageConfiguration = {\n    wordPattern: /\\w*/\n}\n\nexport function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) \n{\n    context.subscriptions.push(\n        languages.setLanguageConfiguration('abc', languageConfiguration));\n\n    context.subscriptions.push(\n        languages.registerCompletionItemProvider('abc', new CompletionItemProvider()));\n}\n\nclass CompletionItemProvider implements vscode.CompletionItemProvider {\n    provideCompletionItems(\n        document: TextDocument, position: Position, token: CancellationToken)\n        : CompletionItem[]\n    {\n        return [];\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBoth conditions must be true: if the completion provider provides at least one result then it's shown without a problem. If the wordPattern is a valid one then the intellisense shows \"No suggestions.\" for an empty array without problem.\n\nI think it can also cause crashes with a hover provider too but I haven't pinned that one down.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3962","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3962/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3962/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3962/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3962","id":139923973,"number":3962,"title":"Collapse all and close all icons too similar","user":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":296838217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/ux","name":"ux","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"stevencl","id":1704059,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1704059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl","html_url":"https://github.com/stevencl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"stevencl","id":1704059,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1704059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl","html_url":"https://github.com/stevencl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevencl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-10T15:36:43Z","updated_at":"2017-04-11T18:36:14Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Currently the 'collapse' and 'close all files' icons are very similar.

in the background (see details in the Output npm pane)\n•Set a breakpoint in app.js at the line (or app.ts):\n\nvar app = express()\n•Set a breakpoint in routes\\index.js (or routes\\index.ts) at the line that begins with\n\nres.render('index'\n•F5 to start debugging\n◦Ensure the browser launches (http://localhost:1337)\n◦Ensure both breakpoints are hit\n◦Ensure the url loads successfully \n\n•Walk through the “Profiling” and “Start your profiling session” sections in the Profiling docs, and verify things look as they do in the screenshots ◦ https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/wiki/Profiling#profiling \n◦https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/wiki/Profiling#start-your-profiling-session\n\n•Walk through the “Browsing/Installing new npm packages in the GUI” section ◦ https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/wiki/Npm-Integration#browsinginstalling-new-npm-packages-in-the-gui \n◦Try different VS themes, and make sure things are readable and nothing looks out of place.\n\n•Walk through the Test Explorer documentation: ◦https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/wiki/Test-Explorer#test-explorer\n\n•Browser/Node.js-side editing ◦Create a new directory named “hello”, and right click to add a new javascript item “item1.js” to the directory\n◾Verify that the directory display name changes to “hello (node)”\n◾Verify that Ctrl + Space in item.js produces a completions list with “process” in it. \n◾Right click the directory, and select “Set as Content (Browser code)”\n◾Verify that the directory display name changes to “hello (browser)”\n◾Verify that the build action of the item.js file is now set to “Content”\n◾Add a new javascript file, “item2.js” to the directory, by right clicking the directory and using “Add New Item”\n◾Verify that the directory name is still set to “hello (browser”)\n◾Ctrl + space in the “item2.js” file that has opened, and verify that “document” appears in the completions list\n◾F2 to change the name of the directory, and verify that the edit label is “hello”\n◾Type a new directory name - “goodbye”\n◾Verify that the name of the directory is “goodbye (browser)”\n\n•Right click the project, Add new item, select the “Dockerfile” item template, and verify that the file is generated successfully.\n•Interactive window ◦Open the Node.js Interactive Window using Ctrl+K, N\n◦Run  .npm install azure --save-dev  \n◦Verify that the output is readable and doesn’t include any odd characters once the command finishes executing \n◦Verify that a new entry has appeared in the  npm > dev  node in Solution Explorer and there are no errors/warnings\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3959","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3959/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3959/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3959/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3959","id":139908428,"number":3959,"title":"taskService.run

upgrading to 0.10.10, my Intellisense is now extremely inconsistent and laggy. It happens with most auto-complete attempts, but is most easily reproduced by this [excerpt from another comment I made](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3791#issuecomment-194300157):\n\n> When I hit ctrl+space on \"trycatch\" to get the snippet intellisense option, it will consistently lag about 10sec. Ctrl+space thereafter will be immediate as long as I don't edit anything. But if I hit spacebar just after trycatch (to move the cursor off of the symbol), then left arrow (to return to the end of \"trycatch\"), and then ctrl+space, there will be the 10 second lag again.\n\nThere are some possibly related issues that might help. At first I thought it was related to [this javascript issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3791), but it appears not to be the case. Since it is only lagged and not completely failed, I don't think it is related to [this Typescript issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3889), but it could be. It also resembles [this other Format Code issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3652), but again in my case it does not completely fail. Perhaps because [my project](https://github.com/ibgib/stackGib) is not as large and theirs is possibly just extremely lagged to the point of crashing. \n\n@egamma suggests in [this comment](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3791#issuecomment-194774281) that is the files glob that may be the culprit. We're going to look into this further as I was not aware it was considered an Atom-specific practice, but I would think it unlikely to be the problem as it worked previously without problems and that there are multiple other issues regarding Intellisense problems after the upgrade.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3957","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3957/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3957/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3957/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3957","id":139890518,"number":3957,"title":"[folding]
