After reading [the docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense), however, I still don't understand why my suggestions are so awful.\r\n\r\nFor example, in my TypeScript files I have MANY instances of the word `this` but when I type `t` the highlighted suggestion is `to` despite the fact that `to` is used absolutely nowhere in my file. I have many instances of `console.log` but I have to type `conso` to even get a `console` suggestion and even then it NEVER offers the appropriate `console.log` as a snippet. When I type `log` I get a `log()` function snippet despite no usage of that function by itself.\r\n\r\nI type `c` and the highlighted suggestion is `col` for no apparent reason. Again, I have zero instances of `col`. If I type `con` why is stuff like `ConstrainDOMString` (which I don't use) prioritized before `console.log`?\r\n\r\nI type `a` and I see obscure terms like `AssignedNodesOptions` but no `Array`! I have to scroll the suggestion list to see `Array`.\r\n\r\nYou're probably getting the picture now. There's so many irrelevant completions and snippets that popup that I often just manually type my variable names. Intellisense feels broken like it's not intelligently doing anything but a simply context-free dictionary lookup. Sublime Text 3 had better \"intellisense\".\r\n\r\nHere's a simplified example of this issue:\r\n<img width=\"902\" alt=\"no intellissnse\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1066961/21466756/990fbdca-c99a-11e6-942e-193087e10873.png\">\r\n\r\n`col` is NOT an intelligent suggestion in that context.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17796/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17795","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17795/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17795/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17795/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17795","id":197459578,"number":17795,"title":"[Feature Request]: Filters","user":{"login":"ToxiCore","id":19375915,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19375915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToxiCore","html_url":"https://github.com/ToxiCore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToxiCore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToxiCore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToxiCore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToxiCore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToxiCore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToxiCore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToxiCore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToxiCore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToxiCore/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-12-24T11:31:47Z","updated_at":"2016-12-24T15:59:42Z","closed_at":"2016-12-24T15:59:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Please add the feature to add **filters for directories** inside the editor.\r\n\r\nIt may be done by creating some _meta file_ (thats also not listed in the file-tree) which contains the information what type of files to show and what not:\r\nFor **example** I want to exclude files from showing up by the suffix.
