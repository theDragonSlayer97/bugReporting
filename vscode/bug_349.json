[x] Linux - @chrmarti \r\n- [x] Mac - @isidorn \r\n- [x] Windows - @sandy081 \r\n\r\n**Size: 3**\r\n\r\n**Summary**\r\nTS 2.3 adds new optional checking for JavaScript files. This can be enabled on a per file basis by adding a `// @ts-check` command to the top of the file, or for an entire project using a setting or a `jsconfig`/`tsconfig`\r\n\r\n**Setup**\r\n- Clone or create a simple javascript project with no jsconfig or tsconfig\r\n- Open the project in VSCode\r\n- Make sure you are using TS 2.3.1. Run the `Select TypeScript Version` command and use VSCode's version of TypeScript\r\n\r\n# Scenarios\r\n\r\n**`// @ts-check`**\r\n1. Open a JavaScript file\r\n2. There should be no errors displayed\r\n3. Add `//@ts-check` to the top of the file\r\n4. This may cause errors to start being shown. If there are no errors, try introducing one. Two easy ones: incorrect function arguments based on JsDocs or accessing an undefined property on `this` inside a class\r\n1. Examine these errors and make sure they make sense. \r\n1. There should also be code actions to suppress the individual errors. Ensure these work \r\n1. Removing the `// @ts-check` flag should hide these errors again\r\n\r\n**Using a setting**\r\n1. Set `\"javascript.implicitProjectConfig.checkJs\": true` in the workspace / user settings.\r\n1. Restart VScode to make sure the project has been loaded properly by TypeScript\r\n1. This should enable javascript checking for all js files in a project even without `//@ts-check`. The setting only applies to js files that are not part of a `jsconfig` / `tsconfig` project\r\n1. Try introducing errors into various js files\r\n1. Try adding `//@ts-nocheck` to the top of a file to disable error checking in the file\r\n1. Try creating a simple `jsconfig.json`. This should disable error checking for all files that are included the project defined by the `jsconfig.json`\r\n\r\n**Using a `jsconfig`**\r\n1. Now create a `jsconfig.json` in the root of the project with the contents:\r\n    ```json\r\n    {\r\n         \"compilerOptions\": { \"checkJs\": true }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n1. Restart VScode to make sure the project has been loaded properly by TypeScript\r\n1. This should enable error checking in all js files in the project, even without `//@ts-check`\r\n1. Try introducing errors into various js files\r\n1. Adding `//@ts-nocheck` should disable error checking in a file\r\n\r\n**Using a `tsconfig`**\r\n1. Rename `jsconfig.json` to `tsconfig.json` and set the contents to:\r\n    ```json\r\n    {\r\n         \"compilerOptions\": { \"checkJs\": true, \"allowJs\": true }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n1. Restart VScode to make sure the project has been loaded properly by TypeScript\r\n1. Perform the same basic checks as with the `jsconfig.json`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Multiple settings**\r\nTry combining some of these scenarios together and creating mixed project types. Ensure that error checking shows up or not when expected. The basic summary of when it should be applied:\r\n\r\n1. Error checking should always be opt in.\r\n1. `// @ts-check` and `// @ts-check` should always take precedence\r\n1. If a file is part of a `jsconfig` or `tsconfig` project, that config takes precedence over the `javascript.implicitProjectConfig.checkJs` setting\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25321","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25321/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25321/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25321/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25321","id":224224766,"number":25321,"title":"Fix

VSCode Version: 1.11.2\r\n- OS Version: Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise\r\n\r\nI've created some language specific snippets for an extension and one of them does not display the description in the

of \"if\".  For some reason, the \"if/else_if/else statement\" snippet's description is not listed and defaults to the top of the intellisense list (since it's blank):\r\n\r\n![snippets](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9040032/25399430/0ca8ffc4-29b5-11e7-857e-ce0f0b5027e1.jpg)\r\n\r\nChanging the order of where the snippet is in the list of other snippets or text of the description of the snippet does not resolve the issue.  However, if I add a User Snippet for just the if/else_if/else statement snippet, it then works and both snippets (the language and user specific snippets) display their description).\r\n\r\n![snippets2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9040032/25399710/da4c6fc4-29b5-11e7-91bf-611d90855f1b.jpg)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.   Create a language specific snippet with the above code.\r\n2.   Type \"if\" in a blank document and review the intellisense options.  The description of the \"if/else_if/else\" snippet will not be displayed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25317","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25317/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25317/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25317/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25317","id":224220938,"number":25317,"title":"scripts/npm.sh

You can either run \"the build\" using `ctrl`+`shift`+`b`, or you must explicitly select a task to run.  In Atom and Eclipse, you can hit `F9` to re-run your last build.  This is very handy, and easily what I want to do 80%-90% of the time, just re-run my last build/task command.  However, vscode does not appear to allow you to map any hot-key to the last build/task command.  So if I want to run task `foo`, I would, effectively, have to type `task foo` into the command pallet every time. Things would go a lot faster if I could just type `task foo` into the command pallet just once, then hit a hot-key to repeat the last

Can you please provide the `${relativeFileDirname}` variable?  Also, it would be very helpful to add a variable like `${outputDirname}` and `${relativeOutputDirname}` which would specify the build output directory defined by the `task.json`, globally and overridden by each task in the task array. This way problem matchers can specify something like `\"fileLocation\": [\"relative\", \"${outputDirname}\"]`. If not defined, it can default to the same value as
