The editor was unable to search the include path even after about an hour. Copying just the source files into a new directory and opening it in VS Code resolved the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: Code 1.10.2 (8076a19fdcab7e1fc1707952d652f0bb6c6db331, 2017-03-08T13:56:35.908Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.4.0\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|jsx|TwentyChung|0.0.1|\r\n|vscode-eslint|dbaeumer|1.2.7|\r\n|vscode-instant-markdown|dbankier|1.1.0|\r\n|python|donjayamanne|0.6.0|\r\n|cpptools|ms-vscode|0.10.3|\r\n|latex|ms-vscode|0.1.3|\r\n|cmake|twxs|0.0.17|\r\n|vim|vscodevim|0.6.5|\r\n|debug|webfreak|0.17.0|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
