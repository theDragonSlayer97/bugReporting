Do you have a question?

Open a sample file in a tab (e.g. test.txt)\r\n2. Open the details of an extension in its own separate tab.\r\n3. Scroll down the page of details (use case: editing user settings for that extension, finding out more information, etc.)\r\n4. Switch back to the file (test.txt)\r\n5. Switch back to the extension details.\r\n\r\n**Result:** Extension page reloads and brings the user to the top of the page. This is especially frustrating when you are trying to tweak the settings of an extension by referring to the documentation available on their page and it is not at the top of the document, and are switching back and forth between the tabs.\r\n\r\nI can provide a video if needed, but hopefully the steps above are enough to verify the behavior and potentially fix it.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33817/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33816","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33816/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33816/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33816/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33816","id":255116669,"number":33816,"title":"Folders and files not available in Explorer","user":{"login":"prezzz","id":1976291,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1976291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prezzz","html_url":"https://github.com/prezzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prezzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prezzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prezzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prezzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prezzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prezzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prezzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prezzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prezzz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-09-04T21:03:07Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T11:44:14Z","closed_at":"2017-09-07T11:44:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.15.1 (41abd21afdf7424c89319ee7cb0445cc6f376959, 2017-08-16T18:07:25.676Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.15063\r\n- Extensions: none\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

build.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAccording to [the documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/themes-snippets-colorizers#_textmate-theme-rules) for TextMate scope selectors, VSCode supports the syntax for excluding matching scopes:\r\n> `entity.name.method - source.java` matches all scopes that start with `entity.name.method` but not if a parent scope matches `source.java`\r\n\r\nThis functionality is used in at least one built-in theme that I could find:\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/c00bdb74ee665cccfc5c4e41520893bb19ef61e5/extensions/theme-monokai/themes/monokai-color-theme.json#L316\r\n\r\nBut it seems that this syntax makes the selector with ` - ` in it invalid, and VSCode doesn't apply the given rule to anything at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Put this rule for syntax highlighting in the settings. Confirm that comments turn yellow at least in some files.\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"editor.tokenColorCustomizations\": {\r\n        \"textMateRules\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"scope\": \"comment\",\r\n                \"settings\": {\r\n                    \"foreground\": \"#FFFF00\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Change the line with the scope selector to: \r\n`\"scope\": \"comment - source.js\",`\r\nExpected result: comments that changed their color after step 1 remain yellow in all files except in `.js`.\r\nActual result: all comments reset to a color defined by the current theme.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions:
