was trying inlined sources with remote debugging and noticed some issue with sourcemaps. I went back to try out regular sourcemaps with remote debugging and hit issues as well. \n\n**Basic scenario**\nGet the repro from [here](https://gist.github.com/SofianHn/14f261fe62789c6e4453). \n\nOn machine A (MAC)\n- cd ~/src/tmp\n- tsc\n- node --debug app.js\n\nOn machine B (Windows)\n- cd c:\\src\\tmp\n- tsc\n- configure remote debugging \n  \"address\": (A IP Address),\"remoteRoot\": \"/Users/Sofian/src/tmp\", \"localRoot\": \"${workspaceRoot}\"\n\nActual: I am attaching correctly, I am able to debug but that only works for .js not the .ts files. \nExpected: I should be able to debug in my ts source.\n\n**Advanced scenario**\nthis is even cooler. \n\nOn machine A (MAC)\n- change tsconfig by adding `\"inlineSources\": true`. \n- uncomment debugger from https://gist.github.com/SofianHn/14f261fe62789c6e4453#file-app-ts-L9 \n- node --debug app.js \n\nOn machine B (Windows)\n- cd c:\\src\\\n- mkdir test\n- code . \n- configure the debugger to an attach profile without specifying local and remote root. \n\nActual: the debugger connects the sources are streamed, even without having them in the local machine. But when I change the debugger profile to allow sourcemaps, I can't get the debugger to stream the TS sources. \n\nExpected: It will be super cool if actually the debugger can stream the TS sources. I was able to get it to do this locally by deleting the TS sources without deleting the sourcemaps, it did the right thing by opening a read only TS file. That can be very helpful for debugging live websites. \n\nEither way, this is really cool :) \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2472/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2471","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2471/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2471/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2471/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2471","id":129271022,"number":2471,"title":"It's not possible to step into the code when not running","user":{"login":"SteveALee","id":618922,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/618922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveALee","html_url":"https://github.com/SteveALee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveALee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveALee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveALee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveALee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveALee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveALee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveALee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveALee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveALee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":291057332,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/verified","name":"verified","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-01-27T21:15:54Z","updated_at":"2016-02-26T10:29:24Z","closed_at":"2016-01-28T10:26:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"F10 or F11 do not function to step into the code when in the debugger is not running.
