 keymaps are similar to themes and icon themes. You get them from the marketplace, can install many, but only one is active at a time.

Also, the message to disable other extensions that happen to have set the `Keycaps`-category is easy to dismiss leaving me without an explicit action to configure the active keymap-extension.
