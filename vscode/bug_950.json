VSCode Version: 1.2\n- OS Version: Windows 10.0.10586\n\nThe immediate issue is spacing around anonymous generator functions but there may be other formatting options to consider with later version of ecmascript standards.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nSay I have:\n\n``` javascript\nvar foo = function () { };\nvar bar = function* () {};\n```\n\nand I want them both to be:\n\n``` javascript\nvar foo = function() { };\nvar bar = function*() {};\n```\n\nI would want to add this setting to my user and/or workspace settings:\n\n``` json\n\"javascript.format.insertSpaceAfterFunctionKeywordForAnonymousFunctions\": false\n```\n\nWith this set, if I trigger vscode autoformatting, it only results in:\n\n``` javascript\nvar foo = function() { };\nvar bar = function* () {};\n```\n\n*Note: The anonymous function formatted correctly but the anonymous generator function remains untouched.\n\nI'm not sure what the desired solution here is.\nShould anonymous generator functions be treated as regular anonymous functions? (my gut says no).\nShould another `javascript.format` option be added? (preferred)\n\n``` json\n\"javascript.format.insertSpaceAfterFunctionKeywordAndStarForAnonymousGeneratorFunctions\": false,\n\"javascript.format.insertSpaceAfterGeneratorFunctionStarForAnonymousGeneratorFunctions\": false\n```\n\n``` javascript\n//  true,  true: function * ()\n//  true, false: function *()\n// false,  true: function* ()\n// false, false: function*()\n```\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in vscode v1.2 release, there is now the option to \"auto-fix\" eslint errors.  Could we maybe add to the auto-formatting the option to also trigger linting fixes?\n\n``` json\n\"javascript.format.eslint\": false, true, \"beforeAutoFormat\", \"afterAutoFormat\"\n```\n\nIn which case it would autoFormat, lint, lint then autoFormat, or autoFormat then lint.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7263","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7263/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7263/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7263/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7263","id":158757294,"number":7263,"title":"Allow
