When I open file in shared folder, it always throw some error.\r\nSome is because there is no `tsconfig.json` in `shared`, some is because `shared` cannot find proper `typings` (they are in frontend and backend).\r\n\r\n2. Compile frontend and backend will be successful\r\n3. This problem may be because vscode regard `shared` as a individual project, and will find its `tsconfig.json` and `typings` seperately.\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**\r\n1. Support mark a folder as `shared folder`, do not show error in that folder.\r\n2. Error in that folder should be threw by frontend/backend watch task.\r\n3. Support run multiple tasks parallelly (so that can run frontend/backend watch task at the same time)\r\n4.
