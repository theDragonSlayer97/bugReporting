assume this will become a \"wontfix\" because this is no longer the preferred syntax, but I work in an old Perl codebase which uses the single quote package delimiter here and there, and it really messes with Code's syntax highlighting.

there,\n\nThis happens in 10.8, and it also happened in the last one before that.\n\nHow to reproduce;\n- Create a new extension via \"yo code\". I went with a TypeScript extension.\n- Replace the command implementation with something like this:\n\n```\n     let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.sayHello', () => {\n\n        var editor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;\n        if(!editor) {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        var output = vscode.window.createOutputChannel(\"regex test\");\n\n        var count = 0;\n        for(var i=0; i < editor.document.lineCount; i++)\n        {\n            var line = editor.document.lineAt(i).text;\n\n            if(line.match('vscode')) {\n                console.log('Line matches: ' + line);\n                output.appendLine(line);\n                count++;\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        output.show();\n\n        vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Found ' + count + ' matches');    \n    });\n\n```\n- Press F5 to open a new Code window with the extension running as part of it.\n- Paste some text into the window, where some lines will match. I just pasted the source code from the first window into the new one.\n- Run the extension - F1 then hello, and press enter.\n\nAt least on my machine, this correctly finds the expected lines. The console log output is called only once per line.\n\nHowever, in the OutputChannel, I see something strange. Let us for clarity say that this was the expected output:\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n```\n\nThen this would be the actual output:\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n```\n\nIn other words, it duplicates all the output lines except for the first one.\n\nI created a new test project to reproduce this and it behaved the same way.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2856","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2856/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2856/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2856/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2856","id":132495839,"number":2856,"title":"[json]

It has to be re-applied after each version update, which is why i am asking if you could just add .EJS to the list of extensions/aliases for HTML.\n\n**VSCODE_DIR**:\n    win: \n    c:\\Program

\"**.ejs**\" to extensions array and add \"**ejs**\" to aliases array.\n\nhere is a copy of how my package.json file looks after the change (on version 0.10.8 - older versions use a different file scheme):\n\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"html\",\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"publisher\": \"vscode\",\n    \"engines\": { \"vscode\": \"*\" },\n    \"contributes\": {\n        \"languages\": [{\n

Thank you guys for developing such great tool! :-)\n\nMy development environments are OSX and Windows. I just found an inconsistent behaviour between them. Would you like to take a look, please? Thanks.\n\nMy launch.json file is as follows, which is used to launch electron app using electron executable instead of node executable.\n\n``` json\n        {\n            \"name\": \"sample app\",\n            \"type\": \"node\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/test/app`.js\",\n            \"stopOnEntry\": false,\n            \"args\": [\n            ],\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\n            \"runtimeExecutable\": \"${workspaceRoot}/electron.exe\",  //  <----it points to Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron under OSX\n            \"runtimeArgs\": [\n            ],\n            \"env\": {\n            },\n            \"sourceMaps\": true,\n            \"outDir\": null\n        },\n```\n\nThere are some debug prints in app.js:\n\n``` javascript\n// app.js\nconsole.log('this is for debugging');\n```\n\nThen I press F5 to launch it. It works well under OSX: 'this is for debugging' message is dumped into DEBUG CONSOLE in vscode.\nHowever, there is nothing in DEBUG CONSOLE under Windows platform - except the first message indicating the debugging started:\n\n```\nc:\\VisualStudioCode\\electron.exe --debug-brk=7145 -test\\app.js \n```\n\nVS code is at latest 0.10.8 version(this issue also found in 0.10.7). Both Windows 7 64bit and 10 64bit have this problem.\n\nDid I miss something? Any suggestions/tips/workarounds, please let me know. I've been in this trouble for serveral days. Thanks very much.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2842","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2842/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2842/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2842/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2842","id":132423301,"number":2842,"title":"\"Go to Definition\" can't run when method declarations","user":{"login":"lv7777","id":8572307,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8572307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lv7777","html_url":"https://github.com/lv7777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lv7777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lv7777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lv7777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lv7777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lv7777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lv7777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lv7777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lv7777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lv7777/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-02-09T13:47:44Z","updated_at":"2016-02-11T11:19:37Z","closed_at":"2016-02-11T11:19:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"``` javascript\nlet foo= function(){\n}\nfoo;\n```\n\nabove code can right,but\n\n``` javascript\nlet obj;\nobj.foo= function(){\n}\nfoo;\n```\n\ncan't f12\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2841","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2841/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2841/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2841/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2841","id":132412081,"number":2841,"title":"Cannot Start Omnisharp [ERROR] Error: spawn cmd ENOENT","user":{"login":"sorab2142","id":3336237,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3336237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorab2142","html_url":"https://github.com/sorab2142","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorab2142/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorab2142/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorab2142/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorab2142/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorab2142/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorab2142/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorab2142/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorab2142/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sorab2142/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-02-09T12:51:07Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T12:55:32Z","closed_at":"2016-02-09T12:55:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Trying to open a Unity3d solution (sln).
