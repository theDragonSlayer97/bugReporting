VSCode Version: 1.7.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 8.1\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new VSCode extension\r\n2. Define commands in the package.json for \"Toggle Bold\", \"Toggle Italics\", and \"Toggle Bullets\", complete with icons.\r\n3. Add these commands to the \"editor/title\" menu\r\n4. Load Code with this extension installed\r\n5. Note that the order of icons is changed, with the Bullets icon between Bold and Italic.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16612667/20369687/22fd6304-ac20-11e6-89c7-69c529751e47.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, the ordering of items is strictly by the name of the command. However, this is less than ideal, as it looks strange having Bold and Italic separated. I considered changing the names of the commands to control order, but this would look strange when presented to the user.\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue with [my extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mdickin.markdown-shortcuts). I ended up removing the Bullets icon until I can define the order.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15595","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15595/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15595/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15595/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15595","id":189879338,"number":15595,"title":"Crash upon startup, fresh install, no extensions.","user":{"login":"ghuntley","id":127353,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/127353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghuntley","html_url":"https://github.com/ghuntley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghuntley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghuntley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghuntley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghuntley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghuntley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghuntley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghuntley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghuntley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghuntley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":293389403,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/freeze-slow-crash","name":"freeze-slow-crash","color":"eb6420","default":false},{"id":287991608,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/important","name":"important","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-11-16T23:12:37Z","updated_at":"2017-01-16T23:25:39Z","closed_at":"2016-11-17T05:22:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n- VSCode Version:\r\n```\r\n› code --version\r\n1.7.1\r\n02611b40b24c9df2726ad8b33f5ef5f67ac30b44\r\n```\r\n- OS Version:\r\n```\r\n› uname -a\r\n> macOS Sierra 10.12.1\r\n> Darwin ghuntley-macbookpro.local 16.1.0 Darwin Kernel Version 16.1.0: Thu Oct 13 21:26:57 PDT 2016; root:xnu-3789.21.3~60/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64\r\n```\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCrashes when launching from GUI and also when launched from CLI\r\n\r\n```\r\n› code --list-extensions\r\n<nothing>\r\n› code --verbose ~/Desktop\r\n[warn] kq_init: detected broken kqueue; not using.: Undefined error: 0\r\n[warn] kq_init: detected broken kqueue; not using.: Undefined error: 0\r\n[warn] kq_init: detected broken kqueue; not using.: Undefined error: 0\r\n[warn] kq_init: detected broken kqueue; not using.: Undefined error: 0\r\n[main 10:11:13] Sending env to running instance...\r\n[main 10:11:13] Sent env to running instance.

Note that the return statement in lngLatToXY contains two divisions. This seems to trigger the highlighting for regular expressions and it looks like this:\r\n\r\n![regex-highlight](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2836207/20361314/677ff0b8-abf4-11e6-96e6-9644755fcf15.png)\r\n\r\nBecause of the parentheses that are used in the math operations (note that 3 are opened but only 2 are closed between the two /) the regex highlighter thinks the regex continues on to the next line across many lines until it reaches the next / in the next function. Although it's not valid TS, if I close the paren the style then stops at the second / like so:\r\n\r\n![regex-highlight-fix-not-a-fix](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2836207/20361318/6c0187b4-abf4-11e6-9fd4-da5184317921.png)\r\n\r\nThis is not a regex and should not be colored as one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15581","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15581/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15581/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15581/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15581","id":189809636,"number":15581,"title":"Diff
