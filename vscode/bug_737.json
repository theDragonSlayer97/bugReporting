issues impact users that try to run VS Code against slow network drives.

] we remove folders from the recent folders list when they do not seem to exist even though they are ([13699](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13699))\r\n- [x] when opening an already opened file, we open it to detect the encoding (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21604)\r\n- [x] we close an editor when we detect a file delete event (this can happen from faulty file events) (#11642)\r\n- [x] we prevent saving when we think the contents on disk are newer (which seems to happen sporadically on network drives)
