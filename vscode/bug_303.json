7.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 17.04\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Open SVG file with improper formatting (no line breaks, bad tabbing and spacing, etc.)\r\n2. Press Ctrl-Alt-I (in Ubuntu) or the similar commands for other OSes (see list below)\r\n\r\n**Expected:** \r\n\r\nSince SVG is essentially the same as HTML, it should be formatted in a similar way to HTML. The keyboard shortcuts should work with SVG files.\r\n\r\n**Workaround:** \r\n\r\n- Rename the SVG file to `[Filename].html` \r\n- Open the file in the editor \r\n- Press the appropriate keyboard shortcut to format the \"HTML\"\r\n- Rename the file back to `[Filename].svg`\r\n\r\n**Shortcuts for various OSes:**\r\n\r\n    VSCode on Windows - Shift + Alt + F\r\n    VSCode on MacOS - Shift + Alt + F\r\n    VSCode on Ubuntu - Ctrl + Alt + I\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26694","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26694/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26694/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26694/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26694","id":228858879,"number":26694,"title":"Continue
