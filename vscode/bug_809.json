you register an extension command by defining it in the `package.json` and also registering it within your code.\n\nMy request is to remove commands from needing to be defined in `package.json` contributions and make them definable and registerable only within your code.\n\nThis would open up the door for new functionality and flexibility and dynamic extension command registrations. For example being able to register a command on the fly only for specific languages.\n\nThe other part of this request is to be able to unregister commands so that they do not show up in the command palette anymore. I don't see a way in the API to unregister commands.\n\nAgain, a use case for this would be unregistering a command that is language specific. For example if you have a command you want available only for the HTML language. The way you would accomplish this:\n1. Make your extension activate on the `\"onLanguage:html\"` activationEvent.\n2. Register your extension command in your code so now its available for HTML language\n3. When you switch to a different language, your extension deactivates, you code could deregister the command in you code, so now its no longer available for other extensions\n\nSo now you have an extension command that is limited only to a certain language. This is just a simple example but I imagine there are many other use cases that would come from being able to dynamically register/deregister commands on the fly without needed them to be hardcoded in `package.json`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11505","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11505/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11505/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11505/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11505","id":174921986,"number":11505,"title":"Javascript Intellisense not working","user":{"login":"webglider","id":751875,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/751875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/webglider","html_url":"https://github.com/webglider","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webglider/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webglider/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webglider/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webglider/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webglider/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webglider/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webglider/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webglider/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webglider/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-09-03T23:01:40Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T17:13:17Z","closed_at":"2016-09-06T21:07:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04\n\nI followed all the instructions on the Intellisense for JS setup page.

Turn on _QuickSuggestions_\n2. Try with vs. without `acceptSelectedSuggestionOnEnter`\n\nTo preface... I had to turn off `acceptSelectedSuggestionOnEnter` (by setting `\"editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter\": false,` in my settings.json file) because my fingers are trained to type enter regardless of what is on the screen, apparently they figure the computer is reading my mind, or some such (yep personifying fingers). Anyways, Sometimes I would hit enter because I wanted to use the suggested option, sometimes I wanted a new line and to ignore the option. IDEALLY my behavior is to mouse down and press enter.\n# `\"editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter\": false`\n- [tab]\n- [down] .... => [tab]\n- [down] ..... => [up]...-1 => [tab]\n# `\"editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter\": true`\n- [enter]\n- [ideal]\n- [down] .... => [tab]\n- [down] .... => [enter]\n- [down] ..... => [up]...-1 => [tab]\n- [down] ..... => [up]...-1 => [enter]\n# **IDEAL**\n- [tab](rather - as it is now ,where it is configurable via `keybindings.json`)\n- [down] .... => [tab]\n- [down] .... => [enter]\n- [down] ..... => [up]...-1 => [tab]\n- [down] ..... => [up]...-1 => [enter]\n\nI tried doing this via `keybindings.json` using:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"key\": \"down enter\",\n    \"command\": \"acceptSelectedSuggestion\",\n    \"when\": \"editorTextFocus && suggestWidgetVisible\"\n}\n```\n\nBut that only works for the first entry, afterwards it is pointless and it ruins any other downwards movement. Without a way to know that I am presently in the context or _focus_ of the suggestion dropdown, there is no way for me to know that **Enter** is a valid submission key.  Ideally if there was a `SuggestWidgetFocus` I could do this with a simple\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"key\": \"enter\",\n    \"command\": \"acceptSelectedSuggestion\",\n    \"when\": \"SuggestWidgetFocus\"\n}\n```\n\nor maybe if necessary?\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"key\": \"down\",\n    \"command\": \"SuggestWidgetFocus\",\n    \"when\": \"suggestWidgetVisible\"\n},{\n    \"key\": \"enter\",\n    \"command\": \"acceptSelectedSuggestion\",\n    \"when\": \"SuggestWidgetFocus\"\n}\n```\n\nTo me this would be useful. If others think so - and the workload is not incredible to do, I would GREATLY appreciate this , as always!
