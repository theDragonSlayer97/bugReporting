While it's not entirely clear to me what that means it is somewhat cumbersome to repeat the ids there again, esp if I have created them programmatically. Chances are high I will add some sort of properly on my tasks for that and therefore I'd propose we make the API like that. Something like `[ShellTask|ProcessTask]#kind` which is an enum spelling out different task kinds\r\n* [x] Var-args like this `constructor(name: string, commandLine: string, ...problemMatchers: ProblemMatcher[]);` look nice but put in a corner wrt to evolving the API. You won't be able to add another parameter easily \r\n* [ ] There is `Task#identifier` but there is no obvious reason why.

VSCode Version: 1.10.2 and 1.11.0\r\n- OS Version: All\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install the C++ (cpptools) extension or some other extension that has a code action that calls showTextDocument.\r\n2. Do command C/Cpp: Edit Configurations to cause the c_cpp_properties.json file to be created/opened. With other extensions, you need to open the target file of the showTextDocument for the code action.\r\n3. Open a C/C++ file that has text #include \"nonExistantFile\" on lines 1-36 (or the file that is the source of the code action).\r\n4. Click on the code action lightbulb for the #include line and select \"Add include path to settings\", which will cause an open/ShowTextDocument to occur.\r\n\r\nBug: The code action lightbulb appears on the target document (c_cpp_properties.json) on the same line as the source document. Let me know if you guys suggest some workaround, such as closing the document before showing it. The bug doesn't repro if the target file is dirty (or not open previously). The lightbulb goes away after switching documents.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19859882/24409829/36493af0-1386-11e7-9b0b-f72479ddb0d7.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23432","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23432/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23432/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23432/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23432","id":217571991,"number":23432,"title":"missing
