hash\r\n\t\t\tnext()\r\n\t\t})\r\n\t})\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\nIssue: go to definition and go to implementation redirect me to `d.ts` files, not to implementation of method or function.\r\n\r\nGif VSCode (with issue demo):\r\n\r\n![sublime-go-to-def

Implemented myself. Simple example:\r\n\r\n![vscode-issue-go-to-def gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20873402/27774648-bfd2586e-5f4a-11e7-9f42-760f25401a14.gif)\r\n\r\nI also find this issue: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19672 but it's closed for some reason. It's strange for me because I think \"Go to Definition\" and \"Go to Implementation\" is basic/must have feature in all IDEs.\r\n\r\nOther related

this PR replaces PR #22918 to address issue #2187.\r\n\r\nI noticed that @Tyriar had essentially created a \"simple find widget\" to use in the terminal which was much simpler to reuse than trying to refactor the full \"find widget\".\r\n\r\nI refactored that out into a reusable widget (SimpleFindWidget) and updated the terminal to use it (TerminalFindWidget).\r\n\r\nI then created a WebviewFindWidget to be used by the webview to interact with the native webview find api. To respect the layering contract, I had to make the existing WebviewEditor into an abstract class and extend it in the correct layer so it could have access to the webview. HtmlPreviewPart and ReleaseNotesEditor now extend from that new WebviewEditor implementation and therefore both have access to the new find widget.\r\n\r\nExtensionEditor also now leverages the simple find widget to enable searching through readmes and release notes within the extension editor view.\r\n\r\nFinally, I improved the styling of the simple find widget by adding \"overflow: hidden\" to the containers that use it so that it can properly be animated in.\r\n\r\n**Caveat:** I don't know what HtmlEditorZone is so I didn't test that.\r\n\r\nHere are gifs of it in action:\r\n\r\nThis is the find working in a markdown preview:\r\n![simplefindpreview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2957173/27770047-6675ea40-5f38-11e7-8c4b-91c7dc838865.gif)\r\n\r\nThis is the find working in
