**Quad What???? - What is the goal, you ask?**\r\n>> ** To have quick access to more than 40-100 commands with 3-4 different button click combinations - this is powerfull **  <<\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to request a feature for vs code - I've worked in many programs, also several 3d programs. In 3d we really need to access many functions, same as in vs code.\r\n\r\nIn these 3d programs there is something called a \"Quad menu\". Its equal to right click menu, just with 4 x times more space/actions you can trigger. See it here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Uc52rUtuc\r\nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/DDP5K.png\r\nhttp://jamiesjewels.typepad.com/.a/6a0134897dc259970c014e8c176c8d970d-pi\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n\r\n- Customize every action-item in the quad menu for your own needs.\r\n- Right click to get to the default quad menu (1).\r\n- Click Ctrl+Rightclick, now a new quad menu will pop up with other options and more commands (2).\r\n- Click Ctrl+shift+Rightclick, now a new quad menu will pop up with other options and more commands (3) etc...\r\n- can also be opened from hotkeys like F9 / customize your own keys.\r\n- At the right side of each item in the menu, there is a custom options icon.. this can open additional options for the item.\r\n- additionally, there could be numbers from 1-10 next to each item. clicking 5 on the keyboard will trigger item 5.\r\n\r\nSuddenly you have visual representation of more than 40-100 commands, all categorized. \r\nYou properly forgot most of them, but with this you can access them anytime. - and visually so you wont forget them. Will this help you be more productive?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?  \r\n\r\nExample I created an in Photoshop:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19984581/24357531/428d7782-12fe-11e7-9e99-c750c9527f6d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n
