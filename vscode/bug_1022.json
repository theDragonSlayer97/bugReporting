upon the feedback and development of the File Peek extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=abierbaum.vscode-file-peek) I have a few ideas for refinements for the Peek View.  See also: #3178 for the original discussion.\n- Allow disabling \"escape\" in peek window.  When showing a file in the \"peek\" view, if the user presses escape in either view, the peek window goes away. This isn't great with this use case because someone may naturally press escape to clear the selection in one of the windows\n- Allow user to manually adjust the size of the peek window by dragging a splitter at the bottom of the peek window.\n- Allow disabling the double click behavior inside the click window. (if you double click it opens the peeked file in the editor, replacing the current file) This doesn't work very well if the user just wants to double click to highlight a word inside the peek editor\n\nI know what I am asking about is a bit different than what the peek view was probably intended to support. I am effectively using it as a \"picture-in-picture\" type view to open a sub-editor inside another editor so the developer can see and edit multiple related files in context. I haven't see any editor implement this before but it seems like a pretty interesting way to allow code editing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5119","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5119/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5119/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5119/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/5119","id":147138768,"number":5119,"title":"[Coffeescript]

VSCode Version: 0.10.12-alpha (251829217a4b023830e508fba0274ad660908c22)\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. open files from the typescript repository (best with d.ts files from lib folder)\n2. wait until you see a dialog popping up and the extension host going down (see animation)\n\nThis was likely introduced by https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commit/bac28cc23d17839eb0715790a462ace853597a83. Luckily the windows dialog points me to an assertion in the weak that causes this (https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-weak/blob/master/src/weakref.cc#L221). \n\nNow I notice that there are many more assertions in that library, each of them will cause the extension host to crash. Since I try to update to Electron 0.37.x, I see the extension host crash in a very similar way (though I am not presented with the nice dialog pointing me to where it crashes).\n\nWe should talk about finding a better solution to virtual document recycling. On a separate note, I am not sure why each document has to go through node-weak if we only use it for virtual documents cleanup?\n\n![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/900690/14402633/fbd488b2-fe3b-11e5-9794-dbf13174cb41.gif)\n\n@jrieken @alexandrudima

VSCode Version: 0.10.11\n- OS Version: OS X\n\nThe cancellation token passed to `vscode.ReferenceProvider#provideReferences` appears to not get cancelled ever - and in particular, not get cancelled when the Find References panel is closed by the user.\n\nSince Find References can require an expensive compute operation to be needed, this is particularly unfortunate.  In the `vscode-go` extension, this user command spawns a process which can in pathological cases take more than a minute (and use 100% of multiple cores).  A user can easily do Find References multiple times (because they see no results being returned), causing multiple of these processes to be spawned.\n\nAre there any documented semantics for the cancelation token's passed to these higher level language service APIs?

I have been bouncing between RubyMine and VisualStudioCode (Almost 100% in VisualStudioCode now) and I will say, the file organization in RubyMine for compiled Typescript .ts files is awesome.\n\nIt would be a great feature if you had the option to have a .ts file fold down. In RubyMine, after a typescript compile occurs and you don't have a specific output path set in your tsconfig.json, the .ts contains a dropdown arrow, where the compiled .js.map and .js files are underneath the .ts file.\n\nThis cleans up the directory tree and makes it much easier to navigate files.\n\nBasically, if a .ts file is present in the folder, and a .js and .js.map file is present with the same base file name, you could put them underneath the .ts file.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5092","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5092/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5092/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5092/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5092","id":146904632,"number":5092,"title":"clicking readme on the install menu closes installation pane","user":{"login":"NikosEfthias","id":9097437,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9097437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikosEfthias","html_url":"https://github.com/NikosEfthias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikosEfthias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikosEfthias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikosEfthias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikosEfthias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikosEfthias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikosEfthias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikosEfthias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikosEfthias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikosEfthias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-08T11:38:27Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T08:28:07Z","closed_at":"2016-04-08T14:19:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:1.8.2\n- OS Version:ubuntu 15.10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. ctrl +shift + p open the pane\n2. type ext install\n3. search for extensions and click one of their readme button\n4. the pane will close after clicking\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4978","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507415105","x-github-request-id":"D7C9:3670:ABFA99:1BC09A8:59D9468B","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1023>;
