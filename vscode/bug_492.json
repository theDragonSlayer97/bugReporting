Sorry in advance.\r\n\r\nHere's the question again:\r\n\r\nI was recently added to a syntax theme repo to help maintain after the original maintainer has gone rogue.\r\n\r\nThe issue I'm having is that I'm unable to push to the extension marketplace. How would I go about getting access if I have no contact with the original maintainer?\r\n\r\nAllow me to quickly answer what I'm sure will be the first question asked:\r\n\r\n> \"How were you added as a maintainer without contact to the original maintainer?\"\r\n\r\nThe theme is a repository within a github organization containing repos across many different editors. The organization owner granted me contributor access, however he does not have push access to the vscode marketplace either.\r\n\r\nRepo: https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21015/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21014","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21014/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21014/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21014/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21014","id":209255042,"number":21014,"title":"Bring back vertical splits!","user":{"login":"calloncampbell","id":4095080,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4095080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calloncampbell","html_url":"https://github.com/calloncampbell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calloncampbell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calloncampbell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calloncampbell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calloncampbell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calloncampbell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calloncampbell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calloncampbell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calloncampbell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calloncampbell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-02-21T19:55:09Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T16:10:53Z","closed_at":"2017-02-21T21:54:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.9.1 (f9d0c687ff2ea7aabd85fb9a43129117c0ecf519, 2017-02-09T00:26:45.394Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\r\n- Extensions:\r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|azuretoolsforvscode|bradygaster|1.2.1|\r\n|vscode-svgviewer|cssho|1.3.1|\r\n|net-core-project-manager|ksubedi|0.3.6|\r\n|vscode-JS-CSS-HTML-formatter|lonefy|0.2.2|\r\n|mssql|ms-mssql|0.2.1|\r\n|csharp|ms-vscode|1.7.0|\r\n|PowerShell|ms-vscode|0.9.0|\r\n|azurerm-vscode-tools|msazurermtools|0.3.4|\r\n|vscode-icons|robertohuertasm|7.2.0|\r\n|guides|spywhere|0.6.1|\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
