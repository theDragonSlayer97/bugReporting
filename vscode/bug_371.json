time, VSCode process for Preview gets lots of memory (up to 1GB), updates of preview slow down and its process starts to use whole CPU core (25% on 4-core).\r\nClosing the Preview kills the process with lots of memory and substantial CPU usage.\r\nSometimes it returns for a brief moment to the beginning of the file even though I'm editing at the end of it.\r\n\r\n Other parts of VSCode work as usual.\r\n\r\nThe file I'm editing does not have anything strange inside - few tens of headers, lots of text (mostly long lines) and lots of short formatting - it's documentation.\r\n\r\nScreeenshot
