trying to do C code development using WebFreak001's gdb debugger extension. _Regardless_ of whether and how preLaunchTask fails, Code always tries to launch the application. I tried pretty much every type of error and variations of arguments in the json files, and it _always_ tried to launch my target app (gm).\n\nThis is on Ubuntu 14.04LTS. Originally I was doing make as the prelaunch task, and Code was launching even if the make had errors. The following code demonstrates the problem without using make.\n\nHere is my launch.json:\n\n```\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Debug\",\n            \"type\": \"gdb\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"target\": \"gm\",\n                        //\"arguments\": \"-d '' -i gm.ini.stdtest\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\n                        //\"terminal\": \"\",\n                        \"preLaunchTask\": \"returnv\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nHere is my tasks.json:\n\n```\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"command\": \"returnv\",\n        \"args\": [\"1\"],\n    // The command is a shell script\n    \"isShellCommand\": false,\n    // Show the output window only if unrecognized errors occur.\n    \"showOutput\": \"silent\"\n    //\"problemMatcher\": \"$tsc\"\n}\n```\n\nIt doesn't really matter if gm or returnv even exist (Code will still try to launch gm if returnv is not found), but anyway here is returnv.c . If it's compiled and Code finds it, I can tell that it's running properly from the printout in the Output window.\n\n```\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n    printf(\"argc=%d argv[1]-'0'=%d\\n\", argc, *(argv[1])-'0');\n    exit(*(argv[1])-'0');  // exit with return code given in 1st arg\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3894","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3894/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3894/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3894/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3894","id":139472078,"number":3894,"title":"[Handlebars]

upgraded to 0.10.10 this morning and immediately the TypeScript language support broke.\n\nNo squiggly hints for broken code, no Intellisense completion.

This suggests that VSCODE is indeed starting the TypeScript service and it is probably not failing (it worked in 0.10.9).\n\nDowngrading fixed the issue for me for now, but I'd like to help diagnose the problem or find workarounds if possible.
