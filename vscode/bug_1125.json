the Find widget, the \"Previous match\" and \"Next match\" buttons have labels which include their associated keybindings in parentheses. The \"Replace\" and \"Replace All\" buttons in the Replace Input box don't display keyboard shortcuts.\n\nI looked into this a bit before creating an issue, and the solution isn't the simple \"look up keybinding --> add to label\" approach that I hoped for. It looks like Replace and Replace All don't actually have keybindings defined. Instead, the keys are hardcoded into the `_onReplaceInputKeyDown()` method of [findWidget.ts](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/85de39a54d78de5d247b57d1e2c50cc81192212e/src/vs/editor/contrib/find/browser/findWidget.ts#L284-L292).\n\nI would like to see Replace and Replace All get configurable keyboard shortcuts. The defaults would come from the existing hardcoded values, so the core functionality would be unchanged. With configurable keyboard shortcuts it would be easier to display them cleanly on the Replace and Replace All buttons, and we get some flexibility as a free bonus.\n\nI would like to implement this and submit a PR, but wanted to document and perhaps discuss the issue first to make sure that sort of contribution would be OK. Some comments in #406 brushed up against what I'm suggesting here, but I didn't find any other potential duplicate issues.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2003","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2003/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2003/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2003/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2003","id":126606955,"number":2003,"title":"why

using Angular 2 and TypeScript I noticed that editing `template` strings of components in TypeScript files are not working as one expect. There is not autocomplete for tags and other usual HTML editing features. \n\nFor example\n\n``` ts\nimport {Component} from 'angular2/core';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'my-app',\n    template: '<h1>My First Angular 2 App</h1>'\n})\nexport class AppComponent { }\n```\n\nOf course it's because the type definition has declared `template` as a String and no part of VSCode knows that it's an HTML string.\n\nMy proposal is to define a `HTMLString` type where it's basically just string but helps tooling in cases like this.\n\nIf it was possible to do this, then we can define `CSSString`, `JavaScriptString`, `SCSSString` and so on...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2000/reactions","total_count":32,"+1":32,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1999","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1999/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1999/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1999/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1999","id":126574996,"number":1999,"title":"find
