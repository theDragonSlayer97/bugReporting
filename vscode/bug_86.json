Verify that this is added to the initial launch.json that is created if a project folder has none. Make sure that the correct workspaceFolder is passed to `provideDebugConfigurations` in the 0,1,n-folder workspace configurations. \r\n- implement `resolveDebugConfiguration` by massaging the passed launch config and verify that it is passed to the correct debug adapter.

Create or open a file of any type compatible with VS Code that uses text, preferably .md or .txt but other file types work.\r\n2. Insert text mixed with white space to ensure proper wrapping behavior.\r\n3. At the end of the line, for the last character before wrapping would occur, insert a comma (`,`), a question mark (`?`), or an ampersand (`&`).\r\n4. Follow that character with one of the above listed characters or with a double quotation mark (`\"`) or single quotation mark (`'`) or a space (` `) with no other characters between.\r\n\r\nExpected result: The entire chunk of punctuation wraps as though it were a single word.\r\nActual Result: The second punctuation mark wraps as though the previous mark was whitespace.\r\n\r\n![wrapping](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31398891/29760298-480a0a4e-8b77-11e7-8fc9-0d39c3860c03.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is particularly annoying when writing dialogue

It only occurs when I start typing. I suspect it is the autocomplete dropdown helper, due to the delay until it appears.\r\n\r\nEdit 1: Also, it only happens on some files, for some reason. They all have the '.h' extension and have no more than 500 lines.\r\n\r\nEdit 2: I decided to change to name of the file, and it no longer has this problem. Another thing I noticed is that the the git lines on the side (green and blue) take several seconds to appear (the file only has 100 lines) whereas in other files is almost instant. Perhaps something to do with the git visualisation, since the problem is on the renderer process.\r\n\r\nEdit 3: I commited the changes and that file no longer has issues, so definitely something to do with git. Before the problems what I did was copy a folder I had to name+\"2\", and I started recoding on the file from the original folder. Somehow it messed up with git, perhaps because the diff could just be a rename (the code on the copied folder was kept the same) but then the original file was being modified as well.

to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. I'm unsure when this appeared, but I had installed Eslint extension and went to put the ESLint settings in my json.settings\r\n2. At which point I noticed, when going back and forth testing my eslint configuration, this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfile: 'vscode://defaultsettings/settings.json'\r\nseverity: 'Warning'\r\nmessage: '$ref '/definitions/jspmDefinition' in {1} can not be resolved.'\r\nat: '1,1'\r\nsource: ''\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm myself unsure whats happening here. When I load with no extensions, yes, it does not reproduce, but adding the extensions one by one doesn't seem to reproduce either. From what I can tell, when I actually double click on that error, it takes me to the settings.json  location in vscode:// and at the top and bottom of the file, above the curly braces, there is a opening bracket '[' and closing bracket ']' respectively. I imagine that’s whats throwing that error. I have attempted to try and just edit that file, and it appears I can't. I can't seem to find it either (For the record, I'm on a Mac, 10.12.6)\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: No","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33221","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33221/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33221/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33221/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33221","id":253183252,"number":33221,"title":"JSDoc for a chain assignment functions and objects don't work","user":{"login":"VitorLuizC","id":9027363,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9027363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitorLuizC","html_url":"https://github.com/VitorLuizC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitorLuizC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitorLuizC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitorLuizC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitorLuizC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitorLuizC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitorLuizC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitorLuizC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitorLuizC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitorLuizC/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":286886536,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-27T19:16:03Z","updated_at":"2017-09-20T13:30:31Z","closed_at":"2017-08-28T17:37:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.15.1 (41abd21afdf7424c89319ee7cb0445cc6f376959, 2017-08-16T17:15:57.756Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.7.0\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\nExtension|Author (truncated)|Version\r\n---|---|---\r\nEditorConfig|Edi|0.9.4\r\nvscode-wakatime|Wak|1.1.13\r\nvscode-icontheme-nomo-dark|be5|1.3.2\r\nmarkdown-preview-github-styles|bie|0.0.2\r\nvue-peek|dar|1.0.2\r\nvscode-eslint|dba|1.2.11\r\nGo|luk|0.6.63\r\ntypescript-javascript-grammar|ms-|0.0.23\r\nvetur|oct|0.9.5\r\nvscode-spotify|shy|2.0.0\r\nlanguage-stylus|sys|1.7.3\r\n\r\n(2 theme extensions excluded)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
