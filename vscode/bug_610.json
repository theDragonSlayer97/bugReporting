most of the codebase (examples linked below), the services, parts, etc which depend on workspace context declare that through the dependency injection system, and always read workspace from the WorkspaceContextService (versus some cached instance state). This change replaces hard wires with getter method calls on the injected WorkspaceContextService, and prefers always using these method calls to read workspace.

Create an empty directory\r\n2. Add a single `.ts` file with the following text.\r\n3.  ```ts\r\n    declare module 'commonjs' {\r\n        export = class { };\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    declare module '' {\r\n        import commonjs from 'commonjs';\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n    Note that no errors are displayed\r\n3. Create a file named tsconfig.json\r\n4. Note that the following error is reported `Module ''commonjs'' has no default export.`\r\n\r\nThe example code is deliberately contrived to provide a minimal repro, but the behavior itself is observable across source and declaration files whenever there is no tsconfig.json file present. \r\nThis is also the case in subdirectories of the open directory when a parent directory contains a `tsconfig.json` file _excluding_ the file containing the incorrect code.\r\n\r\nIf a `tsconfig.json` file is added, even if its contents are invalid JSON, the error is correctly reported.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17479","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17479/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17479/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17479/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17479","id":196260396,"number":17479,"title":"vscode

vscode desktop Toggle Terminal presents `CTRL+\\` as the shortcut, which is the equivalent of the US layout ``CTRL+` ``), when pressing it, instead the Split Editor is activated.\r\n\r\nThe Split Editor is actually configured to use the `CTRL+\\` shortcut on the US layout, but on the PT layout the equivalent is `CTRL+~`, which *also* causes the same action.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that while the equivalent key on the current layout is considered, the original key is still mapped, which causes a mapping collision after, in this case Split Editor is declared first, which binds to `CTRL+\\` and `CTRL+~` simultaneously, and Toggle Terminal then can't use `CTRL+\\`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Use a Portuguese-Portugal keyboard layout. (reported in Ubuntu as layout: 'pt,us',)\r\n2. With the default keybindings configuration, both `CTRL+\\` and `CTRL+~` activate workbench.action.splitEditor, and neither activates workbench.action.terminal.toggleTerminal.\r\n3.
