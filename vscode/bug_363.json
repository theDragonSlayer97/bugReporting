relation to https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/682, I've been encountering some scenarios where the debugger hangs. However, I've reached a point in my VSCode session where the debugger simply will not start at all. Nothing new is showing up in the VSCode PowerShell Extension logs, when I attempt to start the debugger, so I am suspicious of VSCode itself having a transient error state in the debug adapter interface.\r\n\r\nI've already tried restarting the PowerShell session, and PowerShell 6.0 is currently showing as active in the status bar, but no matter what, I can't start the debugger. I've tried opening different files to start the debugger, but no file will allow me to invoke the debugger. In fact, I can't even call the `Debug: Start Without Debugging` command from the Command Palette. The entire VSCode debugger seems to be hung. \r\n\r\nAt the top of the VSCode window, the debug commands are visible, but are greyed out, and cannot be clicked on.\r\n\r\nI opened the VSCode Developer Tools and found the following items in the console logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Extension Host] powershell.exe started, pid: 72202, exe: /usr/local/bin/powershell\r\nmessageService.ts:126 Linter pylint is not
