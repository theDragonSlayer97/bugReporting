is the description of my findings. If it's not complete I can add what's needed. \n- VSCode Version: Code 1.6.1 (9e4e44c19e393803e2b05fe2323cf4ed7e36880e, 2016-10-13T16:21:53.542Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\n- Extensions: alefragnani.Bookmarks-0.9.2, christian-kohler.path-intellisense-1.1.0, donjayamanne.githistory-0.1.0, Ionide.Ionide-FAKE-1.1.0, Ionide.Ionide-fsharp-2.8.8, Ionide.Ionide-Paket-1.3.2, mohsen1.prettify-json-0.0.3, ms-vscode.csharp-1.4.1, ms-vscode.PowerShell-0.7.2, ms-vscode.Theme-1337-0.1.2, robertohuertasm.vscode-icons-3.0.7\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Get Ionide-fsharp addon\n2. Create .fsx file (in CRLF mode)\n3. Enter valid F# multi-line value, for example:\n\n``` fsharp\n\"(* some text\non multiple\nlines in comment*)\"\n```\n1. Select typed text\n2. Press Alt-Enter -> which is bound to command FSI: Send selection\n3. See FSI terminal opens and prints out the selected text\n\nThe problem is that when file is in CRLF mode - terminal outputs extra lines, when in LF mode - terminal outputs the same text that was sent to it. \n\nI tracked it down in the Ionide-fsharp plugin to make sure that it is not the plugin messes things up. \nHere's selected text:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3036330/19832186/301f0cec-9e1d-11e6-965c-73e2912f49be.png)\n\nNext the point in code where the text gets sent to Terminal object (which is `fp` on the screen):\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3036330/19832194/56db0552-9e1d-11e6-904a-4a98dd5fd3cb.png)\n\nThe `msg_1` variable is evaluated to \"            @\\\"(\\* starts\\r\\n            let x = 10\\r\\n            *)\\\" \\n;;\\n\"\n\nThis is what gets echoed:

change the file to LF mode and perform same actions I get correct result:

provide API support to lock arbitrary ranges in the editor; i.e. make them read-only so the user and extensions cannot change the text within the region. This feature is supported by emacs (see [inhibit-read-only](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Read-Only-Buffers.html) and [this](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/76531/emacs-make-portion-of-buffer-readonly)). And it is useful for the extension I am writing for the Coq Proof Assistant: where editing a line that has already been interpreted causes the interpreter to roll back its state (potentially losing many minutes, sometimes an hour or so, of processing).\n\nNow that I've made the request, I do have reservations about it being abused by extensions. So I think it would be prudent to also give the user the option to manually unlock any region and to globally disable the feature.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14699/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14698","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14698/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14698/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14698/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14698","id":186093150,"number":14698,"title":"import completion should not triggered by dot","user":{"login":"unional","id":3254987,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3254987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/unional","html_url":"https://github.com/unional","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unional/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unional/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unional/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unional/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unional/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unional/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unional/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unional/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unional/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-29T18:23:49Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T18:46:25Z","closed_at":"2016-11-02T18:46:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.6.1\n- OS Version: Windows Server 2012 R2\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n```\n// type the following\nimport { something } form '[cursor here]\n\n// then type in a dot (\".\")\n```\n\nexpected: no completion.

saw a couple SO questions where a user mentioned errors they saw while debugging, but could not say which extension was responsible for the debugging. Someone should be able to figure it out, but I noticed that there isn't really good traceability from launch config to extension and vice versa. And you could have 5 extensions installed for X, with two different debuggers, and it's not obvious which you're using to debug. Example:\n\nHere's my launch config, which extension am I using?

Alternatively, if you closed VSCode, and then launch it normally without opening a file, it WILL restore your previous session. (I can make a video if my steps to reproduce are unclear).\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nUse the following User settings\n\n```\n// Place your settings in this file to overwrite the default settings\n{\n\n    \"workbench.editor.enablePreview\": false,\n    \"window.openFilesInNewWindow\": false,\n    \"window.reopenFolders\": \"all\"\n}\n```\n1. Open a few files in new tabs\n2.  Close the window\n3. Double click any file (.txt, .js, .html) from Windows explorer and open it with VSCode.\n4. You will notice that your past tabs are cleared and your only tab is the file you opened\n\nThis ONLY happens if you launch VSCode by opening a new file (IE double clicking file in explorer, or right click open with, etc), if you simple click on VSCode it will restore your previous session.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14675/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14674","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14674/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14674/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14674/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14674","id":186002376,"number":14674,"title":"Provide
