injections is a feature of IDEs like Webstorm and PHPStorm that auto-detects when a language is use inside another language and then shows syntax highlighting for that _injected_ language. VS Code currently supports this in a few places:\r\n- `<style>` tags in HTML get CSS highlighting\r\n- `<script>` tags in HTML get JS highlighting\r\n- HTML in a PHP file outside of `<?php ?>` gets highlighting\r\n- Javascript React gets XML highlighting\r\n\r\nBut there are many other contexts where this would be helpful, that are currently not supported and impossible to all hardcode:\r\n- `style` attribute in HTML contain CSS\r\n- String literals in languages like PHP often contain SQL, see #1361. PHPStorm supports this for PHP, but Webstorm for example does not support this for NodeJS. It should really be supported in any language.\r\n- String literals often contain HTML in Javascript or PHP\r\n- HTML event attributes contain Javascript, like `onclick=\"event.preventDefault()\"`\r\n- Countless HTML attributes in the Angular framework have Javascript-like expressions in them, like `ng-if=\"ctrl.items.length > 0 && someOtherValue\"`, but also the mustache syntax `{{ ... }}`.\r\n- `<script type=\"text/ng-template\">` contain Angular templates which is nothing but HTML. This pattern of templates in script tags exists in many of the major client side MVC frameworks.\r\n- Javascript has RegExp literals. In other languages like PHP, RegExps are passed as strings. This is also the case in tasks.json problem matchers for VS Code (RegExp inside JSON string)\r\n\r\nAll of these examples currently don't get colored. It would be awesome if VS Code was able to automatically detect languages in any context (like string literals, HTML attributes and tags) by some language patterns, like `< >` tags for HTML/XML and keywords like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, etc. for SQL. Languages added by extensions should of course also be detected.\r\n\r\nThis would be one of the best features VS Code could offer.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1751/reactions","total_count":87,"+1":81,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1750","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1750/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1750/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1750/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1750","id":124621638,"number":1750,"title":"Proposal:

`insertSpaces = auto` is set and you create a new file, pressing the tab key will insert spaces rather than a tab character.  This is a problematic default because it means there is no easy way to actually get the first tab into the file so the `auto` can start learning what the file's indentation mechanism is.  If you want space indent, you can simply press the space bar a few times to start the learning process.  In order to start a new file with tab indentation though you (currently) need to go find another file with a tab in it, copy the tab, and paste it into the new file.\n\nI recommend having the fallback behavior for an empty file be that the space bar inserts spaces and the tab key inserts tabs.  This way both camps (spaces and tabs) have the ability to reasonably start new files when in auto-mode.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1746","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1746/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1746/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1746/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1746","id":124608231,"number":1746,"title":"vscode
