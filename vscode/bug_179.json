Template strings have variables still in green, like the rest of the string.  Properties on variables are just white, like the variables, not purple like they used to be.\r\n\r\nKeywords are like `class`,` extends` and `new`, are still the same, methods are still orange, booleans are still pink.  It used to be that the keyword `this` was the only white text and now it is red like `global`, `window`, and `Promise`.\r\n\r\nNot sure what happened, but I was very used to this theme and now I feel like I am reading something very unnatural.  I hope it is just a bug, and not that this will be the decision to eliminate those distinctions above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30428/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30427","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30427/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30427/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30427/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30427","id":242182357,"number":30427,"title":"I'm going to have to downgrade from 1.14 - Hangs every 10 - 15 minutes.","user":{"login":"mdenson-dayspring","id":1828232,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1828232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdenson-dayspring","html_url":"https://github.com/mdenson-dayspring","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdenson-dayspring/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdenson-dayspring/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdenson-dayspring/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdenson-dayspring/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdenson-dayspring/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdenson-dayspring/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdenson-dayspring/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdenson-dayspring/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdenson-dayspring/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2017-07-11T21:01:35Z","updated_at":"2017-07-12T14:06:24Z","closed_at":"2017-07-12T14:06:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Upgraded to 1.14 when it available today.
