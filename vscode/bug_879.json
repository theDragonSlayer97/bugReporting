Instead, the 'going to the declaration' should only apply the least amount of scrolling that is necessary to see the function declaration.\nThis means, that, if the function is already visible (just the user does not see it immediately), there should not be any scrolling applied, but just the jumped-to function declaration highlighted.\nAs it is currently, the scrolling is very irritating to the eyes of the user because he loses orientation, when in fact the jumped-to function declaration was just ten lines from the call site.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Write a simple function A\n2. Call that function from callsite C, which is just 15 - 20 lines away from A's declaration\n3. Make sure that both A's declaration and C are visible in the editor area and there is sufficient lines to scroll up/down\n4. Ctrl+LMouse click on C\n5.

VSCode Version: 1.3.1\n- OS Version: Windows 10.0.10586\n\nFrequently when I open a repository in VSCode and do some kind of operation from the command-line in [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/), such as `git rebase`, `git commit`, etc. I will get this error message:\n\n```\nfatal: Unable to create 'C:/Users/James/Code/git/coreclr/.git/index.lock': File exists.\n\nIf no other git process is currently running, this probably means a\ngit process crashed in this repository earlier. Make sure no other git\nprocess is running and remove the file manually to continue.\n```\n\nSometimes this conflict will mess up local changes I've made (e.g. once it caused Git to skip 2 commits while I was rebasing), which means I had to force-pull everything from the remote and start all over again.\n\nThe thing that's kind of strange about it is when I do a `rm .git/index.lock`, most of the times the file will no longer be present; it appears spontaneously _only_ when I try to run a Git command from the terminal. Re-running the command once or twice seems to get rid of the error most of the time; however sometimes the `index.lock` file stays and I have to manually remove it.\n\nUnfortunately, I wasn't able to get a consistent repro for this since it seems to only occur randomly when VSCode is open on the repository; but it's never happened after I closed the editor. (I haven't noticed any pattern even though this has been happening to me for months.) Nevertheless, it would be greatly appreciated if someone could take a look into this, even though I can't tell what's causing it.\n\nThanks! :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9402","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9402/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9402/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9402/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9402","id":165956424,"number":9402,"title":"VSCode Debug C++, breaking point not working","user":{"login":"freedomabcd","id":8486181,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8486181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/freedomabcd","html_url":"https://github.com/freedomabcd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freedomabcd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freedomabcd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freedomabcd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freedomabcd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freedomabcd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freedomabcd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freedomabcd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freedomabcd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freedomabcd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-07-17T02:08:18Z","updated_at":"2016-07-17T13:46:31Z","closed_at":"2016-07-17T13:46:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:1.3.1 \n- OS Version:Ubuntu 14.04\n\nI debug an C++ project onUbuntu 14.04.

Create a new Cocos2x-JS project following steps on: https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x\n   For example: cocos new -l js WebGame\n2. Open project folder in VS Code.\n3. Setup default jsconfig.json which doesn't exclude anything.\n4. Ctrl+Space (autocomplete) and Cmd+Click (go to definition) don't work.\n5. In ./main.js, try Cmd+Click on cc.view or cc.director. VS Code finds an empty reference to cc in Base64Images.js (var cc = cc || {};) and then can't find anything else in cc like cc.view or cc.director etc...\n\nOn opening the same project folder in webstorm, both ctrl+space autocomplete and cmd+click go to definition work as expected. So the problem is not with project or code structure etc.\n\nThe Visual Studio team has been working on improving support for Cocos2dx C++ projects.\n  https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/07/12/cocos2d-x-visual-studio-android-project/\n\nIt will be great if VS Code can support intellisense for large javascript projects like Cocos2dx
