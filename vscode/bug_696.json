really want to switch to VSCode but it's missing an essential editor action. Many editors have an \"auto-indent\" action which automatically indents the current line—or a selection of lines if multiple lines are selected—to the appropriate indentation when used.\r\n\r\nThis is **not** the same as a normal indent: Auto-indent should indent the line immediately to the correct indentation (to the best of the editor's ability, of course) upon use, rather than requiring multiple uses to reach the expected level. If the current line is indented too far, auto-indent should deindent the line appropriately.\r\n\r\nThis is **not** the same as Format Selection: Auto-indent only indents/deindents, it does not preform any other formats. Additionally, auto-indent can be activated without a selection; the target line is inferred from the cursor's position. Auto-indent should work without a formatter, as indentation can be computed the same way as a new line's indentation.\r\n\r\nI find it much more efficient to bind `tab` to the `auto-indent` action, and use `⌘[`/`⌘]` to manually adjust indentation.\r\n\r\nAuto-indent in Sublime Text:\r\nhttps://coderwall.com/p/7yxpdw/auto-indenting-on-sublime-text-3\r\n\r\nAuto-indent in
