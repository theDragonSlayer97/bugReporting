The keyboard layout is ANSI US. I speculate the layout is correct though, as VMWare and Parallels both handle the keyboard properly. Actual keyboard is a Logitech Wave.\n\nOddly enough, Numpad + and - are fine (numpad_add and numpad_subtract). It's the numbers that are not correct. In the capture window, they report 0, 1, 2... rather than numpad0, numpad1, etc.\n\nHere are a couple of the bindings I had set up and were working on the Mac on 1.0 that no longer work with 1.1.x.
