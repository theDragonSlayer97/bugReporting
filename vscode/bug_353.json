to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux (edit: and run `npm install`)\r\n2. Open the new repo folder with vscode.\r\n3. Edit the file src/components/connectAdvanced.js.\r\n4. Hover your mouse pointer over the string `'invariant'` on the line that says `import invariant from 'invariant'`.\r\n5. Press F12 or otherwise activate the `Go to definition` command.\r\n\r\nIn step 4, I expected to see a tool-tip displaying the path to my local `node_modules` directory inside of my repo. Instead, I was shown a path to the global `node_modules/@types` directory on my system.\r\n\r\nLikewise in step 5, when I pressed F12 vscode opened a `index.d.ts` instead of opening the local `node_modules/invariant/index.js` file.\r\n\r\nKnowing the types that vscode is using to display Intellisense is not really useful to me because they almost never match the version of the code that I'm actually working with.

because you'll encounter https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/12364. This build will work: https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/v8.0.0-nightly201703249ff7ed23cd/\r\n\r\nVerify:\r\n- You can set column BPs with shift+f9\r\n- The BPs go to a reasonable column and the debugger stops in that spot\r\n- You can set multiple column BPs on a line\r\n\r\nIf it seems like the BP ends up on a weird column, you can check with Chrome devtools. The blue marks inline are valid BP locations.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/323878/25307722/c0729158-275a-11e7-9fcd-267fa7b0a25f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso test with Node < 8. The column BP behavior is kind of undefined there. Sometimes a BP will go to the next line or a confusing spot, just based on what v8 decides to do. But we have to detect whether it supports a certain API so just sanity check it that you don't see errors or totally broken behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25193","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25193/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25193/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25193/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25193","id":223585579,"number":25193,"title":"intergraded
