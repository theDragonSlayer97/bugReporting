The snippet CAN be triggered by the menu path View > Command Palette > Insert Snippet and scrolling to the bottom of the list where the Prefix and Description are listed.\r\n\r\n**Additional Information:**\r\n\r\nI have a user snippet file for both HTML and JS files as well, and those snippet files appear to be working as designed.
