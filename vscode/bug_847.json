Now that doesn't work.\n\nIf this was an intentional change, it would be nice if the behavior was configurable via a setting.\n\nEDIT: I'm also having trouble with `ctrl+D` not working in other

it possible that you can make the end pattern invalidate the start pattern in the syntax files?\n\nfor example i am trying to add support to php for php 7 and to be more flexible in the formatting:\n\n``` php\npublic function\nWhatever():\nBool { }\n```\n\nbecause of what appears to be limitations of the syntax engine i cannot quite get this fully pulled off though. the problem seems to be that i cannot tell the difference between a call and a define unless the function name is on the same line as function. it seems to be completely unable to check the line before the current line using any of the regex tricks i can devise.\n\nthis lead me to attempting to invalidate the start pattern by using the end pattern. e.g., if end pattern ends with : or { then its a define, else its a call. the problem is that the end pattern does not invalidate the start pattern. so the start pattern will begin highlighting, and if the end pattern is invalid it will break the rest of the file.\n\nthis could be done via an additional option to the json for that pattern as to not break all your syntax files, assuming it is possible at all.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10355","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10355/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10355/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10355/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10355","id":170229509,"number":10355,"title":"[json]

However, I expect it to show language options. This is what the documentation says will happen, as
