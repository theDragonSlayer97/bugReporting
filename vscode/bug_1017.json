VSCode Version: 1.0\n- OS Version: OS X 10.11.4\n\nI just upgraded my VSCode to 1.0 release. Since it supports Traditional Chinese now, my default language was set to `zh-tw` so that some of comments in the newly added config file is in Chinese.\n\nAs you can see in the following screenshot, a Chinese character \"。\", which is equivalent to the period \".\" in English, was matched as part of valid URL, and it caused VSCode direct to a incorrect URL.\n\n![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/W6v2B3J.png)\n\nI have a working fix for this issue, the naive solution is to check if `chCode` in `src/vs/editor/common/modes/linkComputer.ts` is greater than **128**, which means a non-ASCII character. Why to match only ASCII character? Because when you copy a URL from most of web browsers to clipboard, it will be automatically converted into ASCII-only string.\n\nAlso, I came up with another idea to modify the `_cachedResult` to let it cache all the `CharacterClass` result of ASCII characters (0~127). In this way, we only need to modify the default case of the switch clause in the state machine.\n\nWhich solution is more preferable? Please give me some advice then I can submit the patch ASAP.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5267","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5267/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5267/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5267/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/5267","id":148437863,"number":5267,"title":"Update copyright year to 2016","user":{"login":"henkmollema","id":1521207,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1521207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkmollema","html_url":"https://github.com/henkmollema","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkmollema/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkmollema/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkmollema/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkmollema/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkmollema/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkmollema/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkmollema/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkmollema/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkmollema/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2016-04-14T17:58:02Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T08:49:26Z","closed_at":"2016-04-22T08:23:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/pulls/5267","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/5267","diff_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/5267.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/5267.patch"},"body":"The copyright in the about window still shows 2015:\n\n> Copyright (C) 2015 Microsoft.

Create a variable with the identifier of `variation` on `this` or an object's prototype.\n\nExpected result: Highlighting is the same as any other variable.\nActual result: The `var` part of `variation` will be highlighted differently, even though it's part of an identifier name because (_I believe_) there's no preceding `var` on the same line. For example, `var variation = 0;` results in proper highlighting.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1019478/14532242/3f917d62-0215-11e6-9ea6-f3e8d13da25b.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5252","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5252/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5252/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5252/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5252","id":148382421,"number":5252,"title":"using includes() on an Array is shown as an error.
