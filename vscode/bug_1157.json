I've added portable class library and configured gulp-tasks for LESS and TypeScript. So far the project setup works/runs on VS2015. Now Then I cloned my repo on the Mac and tried starting development on the same thing using VSCode but stuck on several points. Some of them may be related to .Net Core, others to EF7 and some of them to VSCode.\n\nSo I try to understand all these things but need some help / input with. Hopefully someone can bring some light in so I can fix my project to get it run/develop on Win/VS2015 and OSX/VSCode.\n\nVSCode related problems:\n- Is it a goal to switch between VS2015 and VSCode back and forth? Means can I open the entire src folder with multiple assemblies in it and get a correct developer experience?\n- Debugger of VSCode does not recognise the already fully configured solution/commands? Should it do that?\n-  When starting the debugger (\"Launch\") I get the error \"spawn mono ENOENT\" without anymore info. What does this mean? A issues with \"Mono\"? I guess the problem comes from the launch.json but I your not find what to fill in there for my ASP.Net 5 app. The commands are already configured in project.json. Shouldn't I just pick them from a list within the VSCode Debugger?\n\nMy repo can be found here: https://github.com/DiveConditions/DiveConditions\n\nCheers, Marc\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1066","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1066/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1066/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1066/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1066","id":120732794,"number":1066,"title":"alt-gr

JavaScript editor does not well support the common pattern of a for loop with a loop variable called 'i'.\n\nWhen writing a JavaScript for loop a common pattern is \n- type 'foo' and chose the for loop template\n- the template comes up with the complete structure and suggests \"index\" as the name of the loop variable.  \n- 'i' is a common loop variable name.  If the user types i to replace index, the code completion engine suggests the 'if' control structure. \n- of course, if you hit enter that inserts an if structure in the middle of the first line of the for loop \n- if you hit any other key to dismiss the 'if' suggestion, that punts you out of the template completion and you have to manually change all of the array names, etc.\n\nThe template completion needs more context to know that a variable name is being entered so a control structure is not a good suggestion.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1056","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1056/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1056/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1056/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1056","id":120692059,"number":1056,"title":"Support

found a minor issue with typescript debugging. When executing a typescript program, breakpoints placed on the first line of static methods are moved to the closing brace of the method. \n\nFor example:\n\n``` typescript\nimport fs = require('fs');\n\nclass MyClass {\n  public static doSomethingStatic(): void {\n    let a: boolean = fs.existsSync('a');\n    let b: boolean = fs.existsSync('b');\n    let c: boolean = fs.existsSync('c');\n  }\n}\n\nMyClass.doSomethingStatic();\n```\n\nBreakpoints on line `b`, `c` work as expected, but putting a breakpoint on line `a` does not work: the breakpoint gets moved to the closing brace `}`.\n\nThe problem is not present in non-static methods.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1046","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1046/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1046/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1046/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1046","id":120602640,"number":1046,"title":"Support
