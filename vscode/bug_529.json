a biggie, but it may at least help people running into the same issue;\r\nTLDR; Quick fix is to disable ``` editor.fontLigatures```.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: Code 1.9.0 (27240e71ef390bf2d66307e677c2a333cebf75af, 2017-02-02T08:23:30.856Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.3.0\r\n- Extensions:\r\n(confirmed not dependent on extensions)\r\n\r\nSince one of the recent updates (2 days ago or so), when ``` editor.fontLigatures``` is enabled, and certain letter combinations are replaced by a ligature, the cursor will become out of sync, that is to say, the actual cursor is several characters behind. This affects only the selected line. Please see screenshots for clarification.\r\n\r\nNotice where my cursor is (note: \"fi\" in \"files\" is replaced with a ligature, and takes up the space for one character)\r\n![before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1612079/22617070/e2b5ba46-eabb-11e6-888c-cc98eca740e2.png)\r\n\r\nAfter I try to enter a dash to separate the words, it ends up here.\r\n![after](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1612079/22617069/e2b27282-eabb-11e6-9eb8-126044cec615.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. set ``` editor.fontLigatures``` to ```true```\r\n2. make sure your ```editor.fontFamily``` has ```Menlo``` first, for example's sake.\r\n3. Create a new (javascript) file, and enter ```let files = []; //this is a comment``` into it. You'll notice very clearly that as soon as the ligatures kick in, the cursor will be out of sync with the actual location.\r\n\r\nAgain, not a game-breaking bug, but it's a bug nonetheless.\r\nOther than that, I'm very satisfied with vscode.

to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open terminal (using zsh in my case)\r\n2. write `cd <tab>` or `cd sth<tab>` (where sth finds no match)\r\n3. Notice the duplicate `cd` and the first cd cannot actually be removed, it's only visual.\r\n\r\n_Note:_ this also occurs in non git directory\r\n\r\n![kapture 2017-02-03 at 23 41 07](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1972567/22615799/d0899b04-ea6a-11e6-830c-eb0294b91fd1.gif)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19901","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19901/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19901/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19901/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19901","id":205322724,"number":19901,"title":"Initial cursor location in terminal is wrong","user":{"login":"tleunen","id":1972567,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1972567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tleunen","html_url":"https://github.com/tleunen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tleunen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tleunen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tleunen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tleunen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tleunen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tleunen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tleunen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tleunen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tleunen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":286886536,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-04T04:39:44Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T19:56:25Z","closed_at":"2017-02-06T19:56:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.9.0 (27240e71ef390bf2d66307e677c2a333cebf75af, 2017-02-02T08:23:30.856Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.4.0\r\n- Extensions:\r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|EditorConfig|EditorConfig|0.3.4|\r\n|vscode-css-modules|clinyong|0.1.2|\r\n|vscode-eslint|dbaeumer|1.2.2|\r\n|docthis|joelday|0.3.10|\r\n|debugger-for-chrome|msjsdiag|2.5.1|\r\n|stylelint|shinnn|0.22.0|\r\n|vscode-react-native|vsmobile|0.2.5|\r\n|ReactSnippets|xabikos|1.2.0|\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
