[x] Windows @SofianHn\n- [x] OS X @joaomoreno \n- [x] Linux @jrieken  \n\nWe added a new command line option `--wait` that makes sure the command only returns after the Code window is closing. This is useful in scenarios where you want to use Code as editor for other tools (e.g. Git)\n- verify the command line option makes the command line only return when the window closes or the application exits\n- verify this works both when Code is not yet running as well as when Code is running\n- play around with configuring Code as editor for git to see how this works (see below)\n- verify you get coloring for `git commit` message, `git add -p` patches and `git rebase` interactive\n\n**Configure Code for Git**\nThere are some areas where it makes sense to use Code for Git\n- `git config --global -e` allows you to edit git config with Code\n- `git rebase HEAD~3 -i` allows to interactive rebase using Code\n- `git commit` allows to use Code for the commit message\n- `git add -p` followed by <kbd>E</kbd> for interactive add\n- `git difftool <commit>` allows to use Code as diff editor for changes\n\nFrom the command line run `git config --global -e` and make sure to have the following entries\n\n``` ini\n[core]\n    editor = code-alpha --wait\n[diff]\n    tool = default-difftool\n[difftool \"default-difftool\"]\n    cmd = code-alpha --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE\n```\n\nNote: you will need `code-alpha` on the `PATH` (you can use F1 to install)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4006/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4005","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4005/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4005/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4005/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4005","id":140149896,"number":4005,"title":"[folding]

The tab changes to 2 chars immediately, But once you move your cursor to the left side document, it will revert back real quick.\n\n![vscode-tab-broken](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/876920/13697624/97708ae0-e7a9-11e5-8d01-50a03253c2bb.gif)\n\nThe biggest disappointment is no matter what I set in `setting.json`, a tab is always 8 spaces in the final output.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3999","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3999/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3999/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3999/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3999","id":140124978,"number":3999,"title":"[Explorer] Project tree structure is broken when opening multiple projects and switching projects from status bar.","user":{"login":"v-pavanp","id":17735796,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17735796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp","html_url":"https://github.com/v-pavanp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2016-03-11T08:49:25Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T06:57:37Z","closed_at":"2016-03-24T06:57:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OS: Windows10\nBuild#: 0.10.12-alpha\nNode: 4.1.1\n\nSteps:\n1.

It should be reasonably fixable in the tooling.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3985","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3985/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3985/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3985/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3985","id":140057011,"number":3985,"title":"[VSCodeEndGameTesting-Aditi][Search][Ember] Searching a large folder causes unresponsive window when running Ember serve","user":{"login":"vsccarl","id":12900364,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12900364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl","html_url":"https://github.com/vsccarl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsccarl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-11T01:17:30Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T22:47:26Z","closed_at":"2016-03-11T07:57:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Using Ember-cli server\nSteps:\n1.

would be nice if extensions could tell vscode to put those CSS color blocks in custom file formats.\n\nFor example I have a function returning all ranges of CSS color codes in my document and just passing that into some function would be all it needs to do.\n\nMaking this a proper API would also make it easier if changes are added to the color block like a future option to make it round or a color picker (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/625).\n\nBasically this could be exported for plugin use:

because I need to keep track of used colors, remove them and store every different color as separate TextDecoration object which becomes quite hard to
