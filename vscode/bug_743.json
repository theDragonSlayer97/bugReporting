Open test.html from the provided .zip file.\n2. Try folding the first div (class=\"bars\")\n3. It seems that folding does not work when the code is not formatted correctly and it will stop at the first problematic element as demonstrated on the following screenshot.\n   ![problematic-fold](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2611068/19269108/2a041060-8fc1-11e6-8027-ee2b9e897bef.PNG)\n\nMaybe that is expected but I think that it makes it difficult to work with random html files which might be an everyday life for some people. I would expect that the whole div is collapsed no matter what the formatting of the child elements is. Not sure if other people expect the current behavior. Ideally there might be an option that dictates different folding modes for HTML.\n\nI hope that this is not a duplicate but I couldn't find this exact issue in the list.
