ways:\r\n\r\n`workspace.asRelativePath(workspace.rootPath)` does not return '' or './'\r\n\r\nok, so the documentation says \r\n> ...or when the path * is not a child of that folder, the input is returned.\r\n\r\nI'll give that part of it a pass, as the root is technically not a child.\r\n\r\nIt does, however, return a modified string, instead of the input: the input's drive backslash is returned as a forward slash.\r\n```\r\nconst wksRoot = workspace.rootPath;  // e:\\foo\r\nconst rel = workspace.asRelativePath(wksRoot) // e:/foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not specific to the root, however.  Any \\ gets converted to /\r\n\r\n`const rel = workspace.asRelativePath('D:\\\\BAR\\\\FOO') // d:/bar/foo`\r\n\r\n\r\nexpected behavior is to actually return the input as specified, so the following code would be valid:\r\n```\r\nconst rel = workspace.asRelativePath(testPath);\r\nif (testPath === rel) { // do non-relative path things }\r\n\r\n```\r\nhaving to do a separate test for (testPath === workspace.rootPath) is not ideal, either.   How is this intended to be handled for the multi-root feature?
