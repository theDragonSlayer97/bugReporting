I have mapped a shortcut to invoke the `Emmet > Wrap Lines with Abbreviation`  command, but then have to type the mnemonic.\r\n3. The is by design and fine, but I'd like to create a complete shortcut for this entire class.  I can't figure out how to construct a snippet or command to wrap the selected lines with `ul>li*|t`.\r\n\r\nCan someone please point me in the right direction?  If needed, I'll create an extension for this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32791","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32791/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32791/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32791/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32791","id":251293750,"number":32791,"title":"Type aliases not respected when auto-implementing a TypeScript interface","user":{"login":"robpaveza","id":1490290,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1490290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpaveza","html_url":"https://github.com/robpaveza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpaveza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpaveza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpaveza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpaveza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpaveza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpaveza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpaveza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpaveza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robpaveza/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291055694,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/typescript","name":"typescript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":286886536,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-18T16:18:12Z","updated_at":"2017-08-18T18:19:53Z","closed_at":"2017-08-18T18:19:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

Open two actual C# files in Visual Studio Code.\r\n2. Press Control + F to find something in one of the open files. Please note at roughly which line you are looking at.\r\n3.

I think it's because of the extra lines it adds (like the references).
