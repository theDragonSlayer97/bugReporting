That is pretty good, but I think this is insufficient: I have encountered a few times where trailing whitespace was _required_ because of various reasons, and thus enabling automatic removal makes me a bit uncomfortable because it would mess up with those cases.\n\nI think it'd be beneficial if there was an option to display trailing whitespace instead.\n\nThe way this would work is by displaying the trailing whitespace in red. It is important to only display the trailing whitespace when the cursor is _not_ positioned after the trailing whitespace: you do not want to see the scary red box when you hit Enter to start a new line and the new line is autoindented. The trailing whitespace is then clearly visible at any time and can be dealt with immediately.\n\nOther, more mature editors do this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/283","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/283/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/283/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/283/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/283","id":117909857,"number":283,"title":"ESLint works when ESLint extension is installed.
