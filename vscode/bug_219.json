VSCode Version: 1.13.1\r\n- OS Version: macOS Sierra\r\n\r\nSummary of issue:\r\nI am trying to use TextEditorEdit replace to replace random text with text including newlines.

Restart vscode\r\n4. _Workspace has recommended extensions_ message appears\r\n\r\nIf a user already has all the recommended workspace extensions installed and enabled, they don't need to access the marketplace to install them - only if the extensions are disabled or not installed\r\n\r\nSelecting `Don't show again` isn't ideal, as you wont get notified when extensions you don't have are added\r\n\r\nEdit: `Don't show again` is also a global setting and not per workspace and appears to be irreversible","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29218","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29218/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29218/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29218/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29218","id":237680835,"number":29218,"title":"VS Code does not open when a file is double-clicked in file explorer","user":{"login":"jeopal","id":23180454,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/23180454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeopal","html_url":"https://github.com/jeopal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeopal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeopal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeopal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeopal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeopal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeopal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeopal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeopal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeopal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-21T22:18:41Z","updated_at":"2017-06-22T04:28:00Z","closed_at":"2017-06-22T04:28:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.13.1 (379d2efb5539b09112c793d3d9a413017d736f89, 2017-06-14T18:21:47.485Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.15063\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|xml|DotJoshJohnson|1.9.1|\r\n|csharp|ms-vscode|1.10.0|\r\n|PowerShell|ms-vscode|1.4.0|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
