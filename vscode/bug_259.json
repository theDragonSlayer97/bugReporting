Press down or up arrow\r\n\r\nWhen performing the steps above, _sometimes_ (about 60% of the time) the cursor moves down in the page, at seemingly random distances. Sometimes it moves to the bottom of the page, sometimes just a few lines. This seems to only happen when having a block of code folded. I'm using the Atom layout, and working in Ruby. Is there another shortcut bound to those key presses? I don't think that that's likely as using `ctrl-tab` and `shift-cmd-]` has the same effect.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28015","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28015/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28015/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28015/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28015","id":233479815,"number":28015,"title":"Add support template function","user":{"login":"Lmathewli","id":19689037,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19689037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lmathewli","html_url":"https://github.com/Lmathewli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lmathewli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lmathewli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lmathewli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lmathewli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lmathewli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lmathewli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lmathewli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lmathewli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lmathewli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":427411234,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/extension-candidate","name":"extension-candidate","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-06-05T02:26:35Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T15:56:00Z","closed_at":"2017-06-05T15:56:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Such as xxx.vue template**\r\n`<template>\r\n  <div class=\"\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<!-- Add \"scoped\" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->\r\n<style lang=\"stylus\" rel=\"stylesheet/stylus\">\r\n</style>\r\n`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4293","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"8C8E:3670:A48E7B:1A8230C:59D935AF","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=260>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=258>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"b73eece5a83303c61293ead339288ff0\"","status":"200 OK"}}
