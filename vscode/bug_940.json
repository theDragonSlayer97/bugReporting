Second, I suggest that lack of reference style documentation on the schema for `tasks.json` masks design flaws, particularly when `tasks.json` contains multiple tasks.   \n- VSCode Version: 1.2.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nBug:  It seems surprising behavior that `taskName` of the individual task selected is automatically inserted as an argument when running the command.    It's best illustrated with the following `tasks.json` which attempts to use `npm run prepublish` as the build command.\n\n```\n{\n    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\n    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"command\": \"npm\",\n    \"isShellCommand\": true,\n    \"args\": [],\n    \"showOutput\": \"silent\",\n    \"tasks\": [\n        {\n        \"taskName\": \"build\",\n        \"isBuildCommand\": true,\n        \"args\": [\"run\", \"prepublish\"],\n        \"problemMatcher\": [\"$tsc\"]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a project with  `.vscode/tasks.json` set as above, and open in VSCode\n2. press Ctrl+Alt+B.\n\nExpected: I expected this to run the following command:\n\n```\nnpm run prepublish\n```\n\nObserved result: the `taskName` of `build` is unexpectedly inserted as an argument in the command, resulting in the following error:\n\n```\nnpm ERR! Windows_NT 10.0.10586\nnpm ERR! argv \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\nodejs\\\\node.exe\" \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Burt_\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\npm\\\\node_modules\\\\npm\\\\bin\\\\npm-cli.js\" \"build\" \"run\" \"prepublish\"\nnpm ERR! node v4.4.5\nnpm ERR! npm  v3.9.5\nnpm ERR! path c:\\my\\ts-npm-module\\run\\package.json\nnpm ERR! code ENOENT\nnpm ERR! errno -4058\nnpm ERR! syscall open\n...\n```\n\nWorkaround: this version of `tasks.json` seems to work:\n\n```\n{\n    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\n    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"command\": \"npm\",\n    \"isShellCommand\": true,\n    \"args\": [\"run\"],\n    \"showOutput\": \"silent\",\n    \"tasks\": [\n        {\n        \"taskName\": \"prepublish\",\n        \"isBuildCommand\": true,\n        \"args\": [],\n        \"problemMatcher\": [\"$tsc\"]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nRelated Question:  is the 'version' element of tasks.json intended to allow semantic versioning of the schema used?  Is there any version-specific documentation on these schemas?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7566","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7566/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7566/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7566/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7566","id":159796464,"number":7566,"title":"\"Open

pretty fantastic, and a couple humorous events events in the Microsoft timeline, to build my case:\n- November 20, 1985 - Windows 1.0 is released and changed the world\n- August 24, 1995 - Windows 95 was released and changed the world\n- Sometime in 1997 - Boston is born, later to be released as Visual Studio, and changed the world\n- January 1999 - Simple Managed C (SMC) was started\n- September 5 2000 - Balmer announces his love for this company and changed the world https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04FOUQpnGsc\n- January 2002 - SMC (now C#) v1.0 is released and changed the world\n- March 6 2008 - \"Developers, Developers, Developers!\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oioj24KQRvM and changed the world\n- March 18 2014 - `Roslyn.Says(\"Hello World\"); //and changed the world` https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/commit/3611ed35610793e814c8aa25715aa582ec08a8b6\n- November 13, 2015 - VSCode is public! https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commit/8f35cc4768393b25468416829e980d7550619fb1 and changed the world\n- Currently - Visual Studio and VSCode are advertised together - https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/visual-studio-homepage-vs.aspx and visual studio code is changing the world\n\nSo much went into the creation of VSCode and I admire the work that has lead up to it, but VSCode apparently has no means of running asp.net csproj projects. Rather than create a new launch.json file in order to do so, shouldn't there just be an import capability?\n\nIf the reply you are currently thinking of starts with: \"Well this is open source software, scratch your own itch\", does that mean that Microsoft is essentially abandoning the existing countless C# projects?  Every event in the timeline above (even the Ballmer ones) starting at 1999 and afterward involved either directly or indirectly C#, it'd be nice if we could simply import our existing projects.\n\nAfter all: \"developers, developers, developers\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7560","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7560/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7560/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7560/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7560","id":159779965,"number":7560,"title":"[Feat]

of the nice things Sublime has over VS Code is workspaces and projects, Sublime allows to set a workspace with configs for it, as well as saving those to load the workspace later.\n\nHowever the feature i want to reccomend is projects, Sublime is great in that regard since the projects are kind like the workspaces, just that they are remembered and is very easy to change between projects with a few keystrokes.\n\nCurrently VS Code doesn't have those concepts so i'm forced to open the top folder that contains all the projects i'm working / had worked on, that's a lot of folders to see, i like clean development environment so it would be a great addition to be able to set projects with just the folders or projects i need, and easily change between projects.\n\nLastly when i mean change between projects i don't mean like the workspaces of Sublime that we need to change by searching the workspace config file in the root of the workspace or wherever you saved it, i mean like Sublime projects that remember the last ones that were used and with a keyboard shortcut allow to see a list of those and quick change between them.\n\n**Sumary:**\n- Add support for multiple base folders in same window.\n- Add support for a project manager that allows to save the previous item as a project for easy dev env restoration.\n- Add an easy way to switch between projects recently used.\n\nI think this would make VS Code even better, any thoughts about this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7560/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7559","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7559/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7559/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7559/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/7559","id":159770777,"number":7559,"title":"Add
