Go to the Search sidebar\r\n2. Turn on Regex\r\n3. Search for something like \"module\\.exports\\.(.*);\" (without the quotes) - that works OK\r\n4. Change that to \"module\\.exports\\.(.*);\\n\" - still works OK\r\n5. Change that to \"module\\.exports\\.(.*);\\nfunction\" - does only find in the open files.\r\n6. Note that in the editor search/replace (CMD-F), it works perfect (both search and replace too)\r\n\r\nTo make things even worse, when the search sidebar finds something using a regex with newline, if you try to use Replace, the sidebar UI gets completely screwed.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21040","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21040/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21040/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21040/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21040","id":209341011,"number":21040,"title":"Feature Request: initialize emmet config","user":{"login":"ogasawara-k","id":16556202,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16556202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogasawara-k","html_url":"https://github.com/ogasawara-k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogasawara-k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogasawara-k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogasawara-k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogasawara-k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogasawara-k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogasawara-k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogasawara-k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogasawara-k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogasawara-k/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":479976993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/emmet","name":"emmet","color":"c2e0c6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"ramya-rao-a","id":16890566,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16890566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a","html_url":"https://github.com/ramya-rao-a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ramya-rao-a","id":16890566,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16890566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a","html_url":"https://github.com/ramya-rao-a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-02-22T03:20:27Z","updated_at":"2017-03-29T00:41:25Z","closed_at":"2017-03-29T00:29:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
