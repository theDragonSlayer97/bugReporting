When I tested the extension, the error message was \"property `label` is mandatory and must be of type `string`\".  This was confusing as the only 'label' property I could think of was the one on `vscode.TreeItem`!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new VS Code extension.\r\n\r\n2. Add the following to `package.json` under the `contributes` section:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"views\": {\r\n      \"explorer\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"foo\",\r\n          \"node\": \"Foo\"  // <- my mistake - should have been 'name'\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Implement the necessary tree provider and activation event (they don't need to do anything).\r\n\r\n4. Launch the extension in the debugger.\r\n\r\nExpected: An error along the lines of \"Contributed view 'foo' must have a 'name' property of type 'string'\" (specifically identifying the 'name' property).\r\n\r\nActual: An error reading \"property `label` is mandatory and must be of type `string`\" - misidentifying the property, and not pointing at the specific culprit.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n-
