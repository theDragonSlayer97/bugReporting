CLA system for this repository is kindly developed and maintained my Microsoft's Open Source team. Kudos to them to take care of this! Over the last weeks, they have been busy improving the CLA checking and signing processes and we are ready to adopt the new system.\r\n\r\nHere is what the new system is all about, in MS Open Source team's @jeffmcaffer's own words:\r\n\r\n----\r\nThe new CLA system has the following improvements:\r\n- **Status checks** – The need for/and completion of a CLA is captured in GitHub PR status checks. As such they can be used to drive behaviors such as blocking the merge of a PR until the CLA is signed. This removes the guess work and potential for error from collaborating with contributors.\r\n- **Chattiness** – By using status checks the system removes the need for PR comments and labels, in turn removing nearly all the CLA-related clutter from the PR interaction.\r\n- **Click to agree** – Contributors agree to the CLA by completing a simple web form rather than working through a DocuSign process.\r\n- **No confirmation lag** – Completed CLAs are now instantly confirmed based on the user’s GitHub credentials. No more waiting for manual validation and confirmation.\r\n- **Based on open source** – We have adopted an existing open source solution (https://cla-assistant.io/) and are contributing heavily to its evolution. We both benefit from the innovation of the SAP team and grow the community. Go figure!\r\n \r\nNotes:\r\n- The rules around CLAs have NOT changed.\r\n- As noted above, labels are no longer being used to indicate the need for or completion of a CLA. That information is conveyed in the status check along with any other validations you may have in place. While this does remove the ability to search for PRs with a particular CLA disposition, we have worked with a number of teams and determined that that search is seldom if ever used and that the reduction in clutter is well worth that tradeoff. If you feel otherwise, please let us know by email to [opensource@microsoft.com](mailto:opensource@microsoft.com).\r\n- We are working on performance improvement that more quickly effect the appropriate status changes once a contributor signs the CLA. The new system is on par with the old but we driving to make it even faster.\r\n \r\nWhat could go wrong:\r\n- Members of the Microsoft Organization being asked to sign the CLA – All Microsoft employees who have linked their Microsoft and GitHub ids are automatically added to the system. If you are a Microsoft FTE or vendor and are being asked to sign the CLA, please check that you have linked the account you are using for the PR. If you have, please contact [opensource@microsoft.com](mailto:opensource@microsoft.com).\r\n- Contributors being asked to sign again – All existing signed CLAs have been primed into the new system. It is possible that a previously signed CLA got missed as some of the data was incomplete. While we expect to keep the new and old systems in sync during the transition, it is possible that some entries will get dropped. If this happens, please both ask the contributor to sign again (with appropriate apologies) and let us know via email to [opensource@microsoft.com](mailto:opensource@microsoft.com).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34239/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34238","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34238/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34238/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34238/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34238","id":257088961,"number":34238,"title":"Hightlight symlink files in the explorer pane","user":{"login":"dmlemos","id":1868454,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1868454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmlemos","html_url":"https://github.com/dmlemos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmlemos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmlemos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmlemos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmlemos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmlemos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmlemos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmlemos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmlemos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmlemos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":301327312,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/explorer-files","name":"explorer-files","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-09-12T15:35:00Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T10:04:37Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"In the explorer, I think it would be useful if the symlink files have a different icon (or a different representation than the regular files).

When I go to quick open one of these files I often have to guess which file is the right one because the full path isn't enough context for me to quickly remember which is the right one. I end up opening multiple files until I guess correctly and find the one that I really want.\r\n\r\nFWIW, there are almost 70 non-unique file names in vscode. Many of these are pairs of interface and implementation. This happens in private code bases as well.\r\n```\r\nfind src/ -name *.ts | grep '\\([^/]\\+\\)$' -o | sort | uniq -c | sort -r | head -n 20\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\n1. User types a query into quick open (e.g. \"actions.ts\").\r\n2. After a delay of no more input, the selected option (i.e. the file that would open if you hit enter) opens in an unpinned editor.\r\n3. Cursoring up/down in the quick open list updates the unpinned editor with the selected file.\r\n4. Hitting enter closed quick open and pins the editor.\r\n\r\nImagine a new unpinned editor behind quick open is live updating as I am cursoring up/down here:\r\n![screen recording 2017-09-12 at 08 26

than nothing.

Add the following snippet to PowerShell snippets:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"Test snippet\": {\r\n        \"prefix\": \"_test\",\r\n        \"body\": [\r\n            \"$$test = '${1:value for test}'\",\r\n            \"$0\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"description\": \"Test snippet for tab stops\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n2. Open new PowerShell window\r\n3. Add snippet by entering `_test` followed by `TAB`\r\n4. The start position is on the `value for test` value.\r\n5. Hit `TAB` and it will jump to the variable `$test`\r\n6. Hit `TAB` again and it will go to the final cursor position.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm assuming it's because the $ is used to identify the tab stops, but in PowerShell I wouldn't want to tab over every variable in a snippet. I also had to add `$$` for the variable name or else it would be lost upon completion of the snippet. I haven't been able to figure out if there is a way to include $ in a PowerShell snippet without including it in the tab order.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34235","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34235/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34235/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34235/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34235","id":257075442,"number":34235,"title":"ImportFileAction

I used the command to save them all. A few moments later I couldn't remember if I had saved them, so I executed the command again to be safe. I don't need VS Code to tell me that it didn't save them a second time, I just need to know that if they weren't saved before, they are now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34225","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34225/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34225/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34225/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34225","id":257017364,"number":34225,"title":"tasks","user":{"login":"sanderbos1402","id":7476607,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7476607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderbos1402","html_url":"https://github.com/sanderbos1402","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderbos1402/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderbos1402/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderbos1402/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderbos1402/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderbos1402/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderbos1402/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderbos1402/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderbos1402/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanderbos1402/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":292032114,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/tasks","name":"tasks","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-12T11:58:30Z","updated_at":"2017-09-14T07:40:25Z","closed_at":"2017-09-14T07:40:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When defining tasks it will work okay for the first folder.\r\nTasks will be stored in the tasks.json AND the workspace.\r\nWhen working with tasks for the second folder tasks will be stored in tasks.json, but will not be added to the workspace. \r\nThese task cannot be used because they will not be found.\r\nYou also cannot use them as a build task in your launch configuration because they will not be found.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.17.0-insider (128a4e3640c5375f7b0bc1cfd37f626481b1386f, 2017-09-12T05:10:59.101Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.7.0\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\nExtension|Author (truncated)|Version\r\n---|---|---\r\nnativescript|Tel|0.7.2\r\ndocomment|k--|0.0.17\r\ncsharp|ms-|1.12.1\r\nPowerShell|ms-|1.4.2\r\nteam|ms-|1.122.0\r\ndebugger-for-chrome|msj|3.2.1\r\nvsc-angular-cli|web|1.0.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

Open a project with many folders (you should be able to scroll in the sidebar file explorer). Maybe expand some folders and have some colorful file icons enabled, it will help recognizing the effect described below.\r\n2. In the sidebar file explorer, right-click any of the upper folders and click \"New File\" or \"New Folder\".\r\n3. Now start scrolling down until the input for the new file name disappears from the viewport.\r\n4. Scroll up again: The input is gone.\r\n\r\n   Instead, all kinds of crazy stuff will happen to the file tree. Keep scrolling up and down, try different scrolling speeds. You will notice files and folders randomly disappearing and re-appearing, or changing order — never in your sight, only in parts of the file tree you're just about to scroll to.\r\n\r\n   It even happened to me that I clicked on a `.gitignore` file but an `.editorconfig` file was opened instead. I scrolled down and up again, and there actually *was* an `.editorconfig` which must have been disappeared before.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce this bug with and without extensions and on two different machines, both running macOS Sierra.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions:

Copy the code below into a file called `greeter.js`\r\n2. Run `node greeter.js` in a terminal\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Greeter = (function(country) {\r\n  // Private\r\n  this.country = country;\r\n\r\n  function getCountry() {\r\n    return country;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  // Public\r\n  var performGreeting = function (name) {\r\n    var country = getCountry();\r\n    \r\n    return 'Hello ' + name + ', from ' + country;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  return {\r\n    greet: performGreeting\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar greeter = new Greeter(\"The Netherlands\");\r\nconsole.log(greeter.greet(\"Lody\"));\r\nconsole.log(greeter.country);\r\n```\r\nUsing the revelealing module pattern in VS Code seems to trip up Intellisense into suggesting the wrong members. The code above was tested in multiple browsers and consoles and run with Node v6.3.0 which behaved as expected. They ran the `greet()` function and returned `undefined` for `greeter.country`:\r\n```bash\r\nλ node greeter.js\r\nHello Lody, from The Netherlands\r\nundefined\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut VS Code's Intellisense reports that `greeter` only contains `country`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1598330/30318944-d12c85de-97ae-11e7-9e18-b82689b34769.png)\r\n\r\nIt also reports the expected interface of `greeter` for the class itself (`Greeter`):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1598330/30318992-eed8773c-97ae-11e7-8678-9e279455fa38.png)\r\n\r\nWhat is expected is VS Code correctly inferring `greeter.greet` to be a function of `Greeter`, with a parameter `name`.\r\n\r\nThis was reproduced in a clean folder of VS Code, with no extensions (launched with `code --disable-extensions`), and no `jsconfig.json`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34213","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34213/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34213/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34213/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34213","id":256979882,"number":34213,"title":"Emmet Bem is not working in vue files","user":{"login":"edDimensi","id":11390039,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11390039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edDimensi","html_url":"https://github.com/edDimensi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edDimensi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edDimensi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edDimensi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edDimensi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edDimensi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edDimensi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edDimensi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edDimensi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edDimensi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":479976993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/emmet","name":"emmet","color":"c2e0c6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"ramya-rao-a","id":16890566,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16890566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a","html_url":"https://github.com/ramya-rao-a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ramya-rao-a","id":16890566,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16890566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a","html_url":"https://github.com/ramya-rao-a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2017-09-12T09:38:09Z","updated_at":"2017-09-14T07:14:06Z","closed_at":"2017-09-13T17:45:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
