thing that this attempted to provide has never worked. Removing it allows Dvorak keybindings to work correctly. Previously it caused keybindings to use the QWERTY POSITION of the key rather than the actual key.\r\n\r\neg. On Dvorak, the default for insert comments is \"Cmd+z\" which would then conflict with the undo shortcut.\r\n\r\nThe current 'fix' does nothing for 'english' based keyboards such as Dvorak, it in fact makes real weird stuff happen because of the 'reverse' mapping it tries to do.\r\n\r\nThis change will cause some keybindings to be unreachable on some keyboard layouts, but it is my view that it is better to map to the _character_ than the key, and then allow the user (of those keyboard) to map to the _key_ they want to use.

Use Dell U2412M calibrated monitor (using calibrated colour profile, a dedicated .icc file created by x-rite colour meter and its software).\r\n2. Connect to macbook pro early 2015 via thuderbolt or HDMI\r\n3. Open a text file in VS Code\r\n\r\nIssue:\r\nText appear to have a background square shapes wrapping it.\r\nMoving the window to the Retina display, the issue disappears.\r\nMoving back to the Dell monitor, the issue reappears.\r\n\r\nUsing alias 'code --disable-gpu' in .bash_profile solves the background issue.\r\nHowever, if in command line interface, VScode cannot open a specific file. It will always default to last used file.\r\nExample:\r\n> code someFile.groovy\r\nVscode will open the previous opened file, instead of someFile.groovy\r\n\r\nAnother example:\r\n> code .\r\nVScode won't show current working directory. Instead, it will display previous working file.\r\n\r\nRemoving the alias from .bash_profile fixes the issues in the examples BUT brings back the background shapes artefacts.\r\n\r\nSee screenshot.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to pass the --disable-gpu argument without breaking the function of opening specific file / folder with VScode?\r\n\r\n\r\n![_bash_profile_-_gillevy](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8454919/20414670/b70750a6-ad87-11e6-8bd8-9189c2428252.png)\r\n\r\n

It would be awesome to have tabs or the possibility to dock panels at the bottom to make easier switching among the different tools available.  In fact, the ability to dock panels, I think, is what made Visual Studio amazing and is a feature that other editors like Atom, Brackets or Sublime totally lack. \r\n\r\nHopefully this is something doable and many others like the idea.
