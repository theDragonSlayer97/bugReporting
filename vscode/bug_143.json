Install typescript:\r\n`npm install typescript --save-dev`.\r\n\r\n2. Create `tsconfig.json ` in the project's root directory:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n        \"target\": \"es5\",\r\n        \"module\": \"commonjs\",\r\n        \"sourceMap\": true,\r\n        \"outDir\": \"./bld\",\r\n        \"rootDir\": \"./\",\r\n        \"strict\": true,\r\n        \"alwaysStrict\": true,\r\n        \"moduleResolution\": \"node\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Create `tasks.json` in `./.vscode`:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n    \"tasks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"typescript\",\r\n            \"tsconfig\": \"tsconfig.json\",\r\n            \"presentation\": {\r\n                \"echo\": true,\r\n                \"reveal\": \"never\",\r\n                \"focus\": false,\r\n                \"panel\": \"shared\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"group\": {\r\n                \"kind\": \"build\",\r\n                \"isDefault\": true\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. Create `test.ts` in the project's root directory:\r\n`console.log(\"Hello, world!\");`\r\n\r\n5. Open `test.ts` in VS Code editor tab. Press `Ctrl+Shift+B`. Despite isDefault is set to true and 'tsconfig.json' is explicitly specified in `tasks.json`, VS Code still asks to choose default build task: `tsc: build tsconfig.json recently used tasks`. When I press `Ctrl+Shift+B` in the context of other editor tabs, e. g. `tsconfig.json`,  confirmation is not required.\r\n\r\nnpm tasks work as expected, i. e. I get no additional confirmations if `isDefault: true`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions:
