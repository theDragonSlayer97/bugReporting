I'm using now, about 2 or 3 months, atom without any problem, again back to VSCode, same. So I did some research, I've found that code has limited file name and `/tmp` folder can cause this problem , I excluded it with config, same.\r\n\r\nI tried with some other projects (Node, Angular,

Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a file and make sure the minimap is enabled and usable.\r\n2. Suspend the system from the power menu.\r\n3. Wake the system up and log in.\r\n4. Observe noise.\r\n\r\nI've only tested this with Ubuntu 16.04, but I have tested it multiple times. I have not tested it between reboots, but I suspect since you'd have to close and reopen the process that it wouldn't occur.\r\n\r\nChanging what the minimap would display in any way I tested (clicking the minimap, scrolling, etc...) reverts the minimap to what it should look like.\r\n\r\nMy best guess (not having looked at the source code or how Linux's suspend works) is that the minimap is a big buffer either on the GPU or in memory that gets written to when scrolling or when the file is loaded for the first time. When the OS suspends the system, it doesn't save the value of the buffer, just its pointer. Then when it gets woken up, the buffer pointer is used (as usual) by VS Code to draw the minimap. During the downtime, the buffer gets written to by other things, and when VS Code comes back to reclaim the memory, it simply displays what's in the buffer as it always has, which is garbage now. As soon as something related changes, the buffer gets rewritten and everything works as it should.\r\n\r\n|Overnight|A Couple
