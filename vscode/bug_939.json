VSCode Version: 1.3.0-Insiders\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Run Code as Administrator.\n2. Create a new File and save it under `C:\\Windows\\System32\\`\n3. The file is actually created and saved under `C:\\Windows\\sysWOW64\\`\n\nCode desperately needs a 64 bit Windows client or to some how handle sysnative filesystem redirection on 64 bit Windows systems globally through the entire application.\n\nOn a 64 bit Windows OS, Code needs to redirect C:\\Windows\\System32\\ to C:\\Windows\\Sysnative. Any extensions that pass Code paths will also have their paths redirected to the wrong location. In many cases, the extension passing the sysnative path might not be an option, and just expects Code to properly handle this.\n\nIn the vscode-powershell extension you can create Editor Commands written in powershell and tie your powershell scripts and modules into the Command Palette. These can be distributed inside your Modules on the PowerShell Gallery, and when the module is loaded by the powershell extension, it loads those Editor commands without any interaction from the user. When these modules interact with the extension, they might be passing paths back to code to edit, open or interact with. The powershell extension is properly running in a 64 bit context, so it is able to do it part properly.\n\nOne example of this breaking might be prompting the user with a list of PowerShell profiles to open in the editor. If the Profile doesn't exist, the extension creates it and then sends the path to Code to be opened. If an all user profile is selected, the command creates the file under `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0` and then passes the same path to Code to open in the editor. The problem, is code just silently does nothing. It is trying to open a file that doesn't exist at `C:\\Windows\\sysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0`\n\nThere could also be potential issues when working with Program Files directories in some cases and registry values that have both 32 and 64 bit locations. Registry will be edited in the wow6432Node location instead of the normal location. So any extension or command in the editor would alter the wrong registry keys.\n\nAlso, if code handled this redirection properly, users could just set cmd.exe or powershell.exe as their terminals and get the proper 64bit terminals and avoid issues like #7095 #6684 #7266 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7611/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7610","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7610/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7610/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7610/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7610","id":159950311,"number":7610,"title":"background-update for new version of VS Code in Ubuntu - or an apt-get repository","user":{"login":"kaanoo2904","id":10462294,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10462294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanoo2904","html_url":"https://github.com/kaanoo2904","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanoo2904/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanoo2904/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanoo2904/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanoo2904/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanoo2904/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanoo2904/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanoo2904/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanoo2904/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaanoo2904/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-13T13:29:26Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T16:16:35Z","closed_at":"2016-06-13T16:16:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.3 Insider\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04\n\nI use VS Code in both Windows and Ubuntu.

VSCode Version: 1.2.0\n- OS Version: OSX\n\nNow when it's possible to [set the `contentText` for a decoration with this change](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/7181), one may need to create quite a few transient decoration types to display/update the side content for certain code lines.\n\nI tried to simulate my scenario and it looks like some resources are not cleared when disposing a decoration type.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nHere is the test code:\n\n``` javascript\n  let getRandomInt = (min, max) => Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min;\n  let decorationTypes = [];\n  let editor = window.visibleTextEditors[0];\n  setInterval(function () {\n    decorationTypes.forEach(dt => {\n      editor.setDecorations(dt, []);\n      dt.dispose();\n    });\n    decorationTypes.length = 0;\n    for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {\n      let dt = window.createTextEditorDecorationType({after: {contentText: getRandomInt(0, Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)}});\n      editor.setDecorations(dt, [new vscode.Range(i, 0, i, 1000)]);\n      decorationTypes.push(dt);\n    }\n  }, 1);\n```\n\nThe memory consumption grows rapidly and after a couple of minutes I get the process crash:\n\n![screen shot 2016-06-13 at 10 36 17 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/979966/16008311/be379352-31ba-11e6-97df-66afe41a656c.png)\n\nNote that the issue can be reproduced with the current release version on VS Code (not only the insiders build), so it wasn't introduced by the change.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7608","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7608/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7608/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7608/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7608","id":159926454,"number":7608,"title":"RawGitService.statusCount

VSCode Version: 1.2.0\n- OS Version: OSX 10.11.5\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a React component as a class, like:\n   `\n   class CommentList extends React.Component {\n   render() {\n     ...\n   }\n   }\n   `\n2. Add a static propType property, like:\n   `\n   class CommentList extends React.Component {\n   static propTypes = {\n     data: PropTypes.array.isRequired\n   };\n   render() {\n     ...\n   }\n   }\n   `\n3. VSC underlines the static propTypes declaration as being an error with `[js] property type declarations can only be used in a 'ts' file.`.
