If the explorer is intended to stay in sync and does so, why have a refresh button? Saw the discussion at https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17354#issuecomment-267524776.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: Version 1.12.0 (1.12.0) (running OSS Dev)\r\n- OS Version: OSX 10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open up the vscode repository. \r\n2. Open `node_modues` folder in explorer and navigate to around `rcedit` to see the proper location.\r\n3. Toggle internal terminal and run npm install `react-grid-layout --save`\r\n4. Notice that `react-grid-layout` has not showed up.\r\n5. Click the refresh button in top right of explorer. Notice that react-grid-layout now appears. Incidentally, refresh is a jarring experience and you lose your place in the editor.\r\n\r\nI built it from source (is there a live or hot reload functionality? or at least an automatic restart? didn't seem to have it) and dropped a few console logs in the explorerView.ts file. It seems to run `shouldRefreshFromEvent()` when I add and delete; noticed it getting as far as https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/a9c372aa55243b8c6e181c337504861df54bba66/src/vs/workbench/parts/files/browser/views/explorerView.ts#L556.\r\n\r\nHappy to do some more investigating if

first...\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24994","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24994/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24994/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24994/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24994","id":222631613,"number":24994,"title":"document
