is a total refactoring of the language definitions (.tmlanguage) file.\n\nNotable changes:\n- General clean-up (moved most of the matching rules to the repository, logically grouped rules etc.)\n- Supports the Stop Parsing operator\n- Added some illegal scopes (bad variable names and space after backtick ++)\n- Added comments where I felt it was needed\n- Much better command highlighting, with highlighting of parameters\n- Workaround for highlighting the reserved word 'default' in switch-blocks (Will only highlight the word inside scriptblocks, so will also highlight in `{default}`\n- Fixed highlighting of comment based help keywords\n- More consequent highlighting of numerical constants\n- Changed some scope names\n- Better type highlighting\n- Highlighting of keywords in classes\n- Added highlighting of built-in aliases and executable files (.ps1, .exe etc)\n- Added highlighting of some missing operators\n- Better highlighting of properties/members\n\nCompare:

However, I am using Code on my work PC and do not have admin rights, so am unable to install this. Code still seems to function largely OK (except for the automatic file update issue related to #9), but I get a repeated warning to install the .NET framework which gets old pretty fast.\n\nAny chance of adding an option to disable this warning for those of us using Code on Windows 7 with no admin rights to update the .NET framework?\n\nThanks for a great product! \n- VSCode Version: 1.2\n- OS

would be useful for extension developers to get a range of visible positions (or lines) in the editor.\n\nThis would be useful when the extension is dealing with the visual aspect of the VSCode since the extension does not need to update the visual on invisible area.\n\nFor example, [Guides](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=spywhere.guides) needs to update its indentation guide lines but this has impact the extension performance (https://github.com/spywhere/vscode-guides/issues/6) due to a calculation on whole file which cause the lag on the VSCode.

Would this be something that could be added?\n\nFor me, on a virtualbox linux vm, both the Chrome browser and VS Code lock completely and only runs correctly when either...\n1) I turn off 3D display acceleration for the the whole guest vm in the settings, then both run OK, or...\n2) I run virtualbox guest additions 5.0.16 or earlier, then both run OK\n3) I can turn off hardware acceleration for the Chrome browser, in Chrome settings, then Chrome browser runs OK, even with the 3D accel on for the rest of the client vm - which is why I was looking for an option to turn it off in VS Code\n\nIn all cases, the vbox host is windows 10 pro\n\nHope that makes sense.\n\nthanks,\nDavid\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7508","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7508/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7508/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7508/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7508","id":159535033,"number":7508,"title":"Paste

Perhaps having this on all the time has considerable performance ramifications? I've had \"Async\" checked ever since it was announced, but I can imagine a release that turns this on by default could be met with developer confusion / frustration.\n\nWould following Chrome's lead here and just providing a checkbox (or a flag in the debug configuration JSON) be the best initial

UX Meeting: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7338, topic \"Update on separating editor and group actions\"_\n## No Tabs: Group Level Commands\n\nAs a part of the work to support tabs, we made some assumptions about the need for managing stacks of editors when tabs are **not** enabled. We believed that users would want the following:\n- A group level affordance that indicates when there are multiple editors open in a group (when clicked it shows these open editors).\n- A group level overflow button with the following items:\n  - “Close All” open editors in a group at once, thus closing the group when empty editors are not enabled.\n  - “Move Left” / “Move Right” the group (same result as dragging a group).\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1487073/15947974/2eef5dca-2e53-11e6-819a-de3fb1b57d28.png)\n\nAfter dogfooding with the [Insiders Release](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders) we think it’s possible these UI elements are actually not needed:\n- The Open Editors area in the explorer already indicates when multiple editors are open in a group and what they are.\n- Closing all editors is possible from Open Editors\n- Moving groups left and right is already possible through dragging the editor or in Open Editors, although this needs to be accessible\n\nFurthermore, it is visually \"noisy\" to have these group-level commands when tabs are not enabled.  The extra buttons increase the complexity, and the lighter gray background that separates the group-level commands from the editor commands is heavy and attention-grabbing.\n\nFinally, corner cases exist where you could have two overflow menus, one for local commands and one for group-level commands.  This is confusing and undesirable.\n\n![doubleoverflow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1487073/15948080/b0eda91c-2e53-11e6-84d6-4f174b80a86f.jpeg)\n### Conclusion\n\nWe decided that it would be best to revert these changes and remove the group-level commands to eliminate duplicate functionality and keep the current (\"no tabs\") model intact for the \"tabs disabled\" scenario.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7506/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7505","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7505/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7505/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7505/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7505","id":159524887,"number":7505,"title":"Installation
