OS X, VSCode can persist without any open windows, and remain perfectly usable through the menu bar / dock icon. (Which is great, since it matches OS X's document-centric UI conventions 100%.)\n\nBecause of that, I believe it doesn't make a lot of sense to keep non-project (purple) windows open on OS X without any open editors on them, like on this screenshot: \n\n![](https://cloudup.com/cE42l-2NmsT+)\n\nFor project (blue) windows, keeping them open makes total sense, since the project itself can be seen as a “document” from the perspective of the document-centric UI.\n\nWith this in mind, I'd like to propose that on OS X, whenever you close the last document on a non-project (purple) window, the window itself closes. This behavior would make VS Code consistent with both TextMate and Sublime Text, especially now that you're going to introduce tabs.\n\nMaybe this could be exposed as an option, on by default on OS X. (That way OS X users that want to retain the current behavior can do so, and users of Linux/Windows that want the window closing behavior can also do so.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7930/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7929","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7929/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7929/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7929/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7929","id":161492178,"number":7929,"title":"Support `-r` flag when combined with `-w`","user":{"login":"coreh","id":418473,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/418473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh","html_url":"https://github.com/coreh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-06-21T17:14:25Z","updated_at":"2017-09-09T08:38:06Z","closed_at":"2017-09-09T08:38:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.2.1\n- OS Version: OS X 10.11.5\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

If everything is very bad, then let me know about this or add the proposed PR manually with correct code.\n## Why?\n\nIn the previous PR was added support Emmet for Sass and Stylus (#7887). That's cool, but Stylus has free syntax. For example:\n\n``` stylus\n.test {\n  font-size: 14px;\n  position absolute;\n  display: block\n}\n```\n\nBy default, Emmet has the syntax: `position absolute` or `font-size 14px`. Using the Emmet preferences you can fix this. This PR adds support for Emmet preferences and syntaxProfiles.\n## Demo\n- Emmet preferences:\n  \n  ![preferences](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7034281/16228916/7358304a-37c2-11e6-96b1-15e3f5c9f334.gif)\n- Emmet syntaxProfiles\n  \n  ![syntaxProfiles](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7034281/16228958/bdca39c0-37c2-11e6-9538-4fc1824ab1b7.gif)\n## Why you do not use `emmet.preferences.load()` or `emmet.loadPreferences()`\n\nUnfortunately, both methods work only with `emmet.preferences.set()` and not provide access to `emmet.preferences.define()` that there is a need for rules that are not declared by default.\n## Question for developers\n\nI'm not sure that the code in the constructor is correct. I couldn't think of a better way for access to Emmet one time.\n\n``` ts\n    require(['emmet'], (_module) => {\n        this.backupDefaultPreferences(_module);\n\n        const disposable = configurationService.onDidUpdateConfiguration(e => this.updateEmmetConfig(_module, e.config));\n        this.disposables.push(disposable);\n

when tabbing through snippets you get the order each tab-stop/id is parsed. I've tried to improve on this with the following criterias:\n- Id's are sorted first with their relative order unchanged (e.g. {id}, {id:label})\n- Tab-stops follow id's, and are sorted in ascending order (e.g. \"$2 $3 $1\" => $1, $2, $3)\n- The $0 (or highest tab-stop) will be used as the final placeHolder\n\nI've added a few tests and tested this with various snippets and I think it feels much better.
