@alefragnani on November 4, 2015 1:12_\n\nIs there a _correct way_ to replace core commands? \n_(of course, if this is something that is available or in the roadmap)_\n\nMy intention is to create an extension to replace _Edit / Copy (`editor.action.clipboardCopyAction`)_ and _Edit / Cut (`editor.action.clipboardCutAction`)_ commands. So, when there is no selection, the _Copy/Cut_ would use the _current word_ instead of the _entire line_.\n\nAbout coding, I can:\n- Determine the word based on the cursor position\n- Select the word\n- Execute `vscode.commands.executeCommand(\"editor.action.clipboardCopyAction\")` \n- Remove the selection, returning the cursor to its initial position.\n\nBut I was wondering if there is something else that I could (or couldn't) do, like defining the `keybindings` in `package.json` to `Ctrl + C / Ctrl + X`; or define `vscode.commands.registerCommand` for the core command, with my own code.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n_Copied from original issue:

@guillermooo on November 8, 2015 13:4_\n\nFor Vim emulation, there needs to be a way to capture key strokes and suppress them before they are inserted in the buffer. That is, normal mode in Vim.\n\nIn other editors, it's a problem that all key bindings work by default in normal mode. Because plugins are loaded alphabetically, there is then a chance that the plugin to load last may override Vim key bindings, even though that plugin isn't interested in normal mode at all and/or doesn't even work when the editor is in normal mode.\n\nWhen VS Code enables a variant of normal mode (when? :-)), I think it'd be best if key bindings had to opt-in explicitly to normal mode.\n\n_Copied from original issue:

@SamVerschueren on October 30, 2015 6:9_\n\nI might have seen a post regarding styling of the `OutputChannel`, but not sure though.\n\nI think it would be a nice feature to support ANSI colors. This way libraries like [chalk](https://github.com/chalk) can be used to style the output. Another benefit is that if you develop a plugin like Yeoman, who outputs to the console, the output can be directly passed to the `OutputChannel`.\n\nNot sure if this is possible, but I think it would be a nice feature. No need to implement our own styling stuff in the channel, just use libraries that already exist.\n\n_Copied from original issue:
