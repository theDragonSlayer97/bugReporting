I've searched the source code, but never found anything triggering it specifically. I found a text model interface with undo/redo methods, but nothing more then that.\n\nIs VSCode just relying on the native browsers support for undo? I ask, because I'm building a plugin, that requires calling undo, but can't find a way to call it through vscode. I could build my own stack for something like that, but seems redundant, when it should rely on the same system vscode does.\n\nCheers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/780","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/780/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/780/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/780/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/780","id":119311726,"number":780,"title":"Update

nice that the implementations of `FormatDocumentProvider` and `DocumentSymbolProvider` can be used via `executeCommand`.  However, the return types are undocumented and subtely different from what the implementation side produces.\n1. Is this intentional?\n2. Is it considered a supported scenario for extensions to use `executeCommand` on these commands?  Or should they factor out their implementation and use the implementation code directly?\n\nFor `FormatDocumentProvider` for example, I provide a `TextEdit[]` which is:\n\n``` json\n[\n {\n  \"_range\": {\n   \"_start\": {\n    \"_line\": 2,\n    \"_character\": 7\n   },\n   \"_end\": {\n    \"_line\": 4,\n    \"_character\": 4\n   }\n  },\n  \"_newText\": \"\"\n },\n {\n  \"_range\": {\n   \"_start\": {\n    \"_line\": 4,\n    \"_character\": 14\n   },\n   \"_end\": {\n    \"_line\": 5,\n    \"_character\": 1\n   }\n  },\n  \"_newText\": \"\"\n }\n]\n```\n\nbut `executeCommand(\"vscode.executeFormatDocumentProvider\", ...)` receives this as:\n\n``` json\n[\n {\n  \"text\": \"\",\n  \"range\": {\n   \"startLineNumber\": 3,\n   \"startColumn\": 8,\n   \"endLineNumber\": 5,\n   \"endColumn\": 5\n  }\n },\n {\n  \"text\": \"\",\n  \"range\": {\n   \"startLineNumber\": 5,\n   \"startColumn\": 15,\n   \"endLineNumber\": 6,\n   \"endColumn\": 2\n  }\n }\n]\n```\n\nThe combination of completely different shape plus the 1-based numbering makes this data difficult to work with.\n\nSimilarly different results are returned from others similar commands.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/768","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/768/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/768/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/768/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/768","id":119267638,"number":768,"title":"Does
