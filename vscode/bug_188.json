using Kali Linux and every time When VS Code prompts an update available, It just don't update itself but rather redirects me to the site, makes me download the .deb file and I have to manually install it. This affects the workflow too much. I really love the typescript support that VS Code gives and this issue bothers me a lot. Is there a way/Plugin to do this automatically? \r\n\r\nPS: I saw this issue [#9539](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9539). I can agree that we can't just allow auto update in the background cuz people may rely on one feature which might break on auto-update, but atleast when the user is willing to update(by going to Help->update or clicking update on the notification) there should be automatic background update.
