The \"S\" will work the first time.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a race condition where the \"S\" keystroke gets swallowed before the File menu is displayed.\r\n\r\nData loss has led me to develop an Alt+F,S twitch over the years - I do that key combination every few minutes, without thinking about it, in all applications, and have done so for more than a decade.

The multiroot UI should be usable and make sense. The non-multiroot UI should look the same.\r\n- Try the \"Find in Folder\" context menu item.
