creating an extension the author can activate it by listening for a specific command event, however this is the only time when an extension can seemingly respond to a command.\n\nIt would be very useful to have an `onCommand(...)` type listener option.\n\nMy use case was creating an status bar extension that could watch for build tasks `workbench.action.tasks.build`, and then also listen for `workbench.action.tasks.terminate` to be able to show an icon to illustrate the watching task, and provide and option for terminating it through the UI.\n\nHowever I believe this functionality would be very useful to other extensions, as would an API for checking running task statuses etc. but that's a separate

However, because the output is always scrolled to the bottom, the feature is not very usable.\n\n![vsc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/979966/18297876/89eb183c-74f7-11e6-9de8-206227f85db5.gif)\n\nOutput channels provide a way for an extension to display some custom output, so I think it's really essential to provide a way to tell an output channel to not scroll to the bottom.\n\n[This issue solution](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3351) had resolved the problem for output channels that are constantly appending to the end of the output. Would be great to have a solution for extensions that are refreshing the output as well.\n\nPerhaps the `export function createOutputChannel(name: string): OutputChannel;` function could take an options object where one could completely disable the auto-scrolling? Or maybe expose some scrolling functions in the `OutputChannel` type.\n\n/cc @isidorn

for #6915:\n- [x] Windows - @roblourens \n- [x] OS X - @ramya-rao-a \n- [x] Linux - @Tyriar\n\nComplexity 3\n\nWhen debugging transpiled code (e.g. TypeScript) and the build process generates the JavaScript code into a specific directory, it is necessary to help the node debugger finding this generated code. In previous version of VS Code this was done by specifying the root directory of the generated code via the `outDir` attribute.\n\nIn this release it is now possible to use multiple glob patterns for including and excluding files from the set of generated JavaScript files. For this a new array typed attribute `outFiles` has been introduced. The old `outDir` is still supported, but we plan to deprecated this in the future.\n\nThe following example shows how to configure source maps if the generated code lives in an \"out\" and \"node_modules\" directory and you want to exclude the generated test code:\n\n``` json\n  \"sourceMaps\": true,\n  \"outFiles\": [\n    \"${workspaceRoot}/{out,node_modules}/**/*.js\",\n    \"!${workspaceRoot}/out/tests/**/*.js\"\n  ]\n```\n\nVerify this feature with an 'interesting' source map setup as follows:\n- launch a debug session\n- as long as `outFiles` hasn't been configured, setting a breakpoint in source should result in an unverified (grey) breakpoint because node-debug cannot find the corresponding generated code (which should have a 'sourceMappingURL' that points to the source via a source map).\n- configure the `outFiles` attribute and restart debug session\n- now the breakpoint should verify (and should be hit).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12253","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12253/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12253/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12253/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12253","id":177735398,"number":12253,"title":"Test launch option that allows run node project by npm script","user":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/26","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/26","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/26/labels","id":1944122,"number":26,"title":"September 2016","description":"","creator":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":471,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-16T05:20:24Z","updated_at":"2017-02-21T21:56:29Z","due_on":"2016-09-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-10-14T14:18:36Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-09-19T09:07:56Z","updated_at":"2016-10-10T08:10:05Z","closed_at":"2016-09-27T23:46:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Test for #2726:\n- [x] any OS -

VSCode Version: 1.5.2\n- OS Version: OSX 10.11.6\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. use `vscode.window.showInputBox`\n2. pass a string to the `value` options field\n3. Hit enter\n\nPlease have a look at the following code:\n\n``` typescript\nwindow.showInputBox({\n    prompt: 'Please enter a variable name for the default export',\n    placeHolder: 'Default export name',\n    value: declaration.name,\n    validateInput: s => !!s ? '' : 'Please enter a variable name'\n}).then(defaultAlias => {\n    if (defaultAlias) {\n        console.log('something set!');\n    }\n}));\n```\n\nThe value in the `value` field of the options hash is not passed, when the user just hits \"enter\". So if the user is fine with my prediction, an empty string is passed to the promise. The problem is, that this also happens when the user hits escape.\n\nIn my opinion, `showInputBox` should pass the inserted value to the promise IF the user hits enter and `undefined` when the user hits escape.\n\nCheers\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12243","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12243/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12243/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12243/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/12243","id":177712333,"number":12243,"title":"Util

VSCode Version: 1.5.2\n- OS Version: 10.11.6\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

With both single quote marks selected hit `DELETE` to remove them\n4. Hit the single _or_ double quote mark key to add the quote marks back in\n5. Observe that two quote marks are added at the end of the word\n\nThis is unexpected behaviour and not inline with what SublimeText does. When pasting code from the net using double quote marks, I select one of the quote marks, hold `CMD+D` until all of them are selected, then hit `DELETE`, then hit the single quote key. At least this is what I used to do in SublimeText.\n\nI appreciate that what I am trying to achieve can be done with 'find and replace', but this is a habit I have formed that is faster and more familiar to me...don't judge :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12239/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12238","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12238/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12238/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12238/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12238","id":177704070,"number":12238,"title":"Install a specific version of the package","user":{"login":"fronteed","id":1612675,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1612675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fronteed","html_url":"https://github.com/fronteed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fronteed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fronteed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fronteed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fronteed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fronteed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fronteed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fronteed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fronteed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fronteed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-19T04:57:35Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T08:52:08Z","closed_at":"2016-09-19T08:52:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.5.2\n- OS Version: OS X El Capitan\n\nIf I switch on the packages autoupdate option and some package will get broken, how do I revert it's update to the previous version.
