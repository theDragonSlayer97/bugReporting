Essentially when running VS Code with the `./script/code.sh` script, setting these flags in `execArgv` options in `typescriptserviceclient.ts` had no effect. I think it'll work if Electron is packaged and ran normally, but I'm not positive.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33524/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33523","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33523/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33523/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33523/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33523","id":254031337,"number":33523,"title":"TaskProvider:

Create a new extension\r\n2. Register a `taskProvider` that provides incomplete tasks in `provideTasks()` and completes them in `resolveTask`\r\n3. Launch the extension and list tasks in the command palette\r\n\r\nHere is a minimal example:\r\n```typescript\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nimport * as vscode from 'vscode';\r\n\r\nexport function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {\r\n    let provider = vscode.workspace.registerTaskProvider('test', {\r\n        provideTasks: () => [new vscode.Task({ type: 'test' }, 'test', 'source')],\r\n        resolveTask: (task: vscode.Task) => {\r\n            task.execution = new vscode.ShellExecution('echo Hello');\r\n            return task;\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    context.subscriptions.push(provider);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function deactivate() {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\nAs I understand, `resolveTask()` should be called to complete incomplete tasks just like with [code lenses](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api#CodeLensProvider): `provideCodeLenses()` can return incomplete code lenses that will be later completed upon calling `resolveCodeLens()`.\r\nHowever, `resolveTask()` never seems to be called at any point, and if `provideTasks()` returns incomplete tasks, these tasks will simply not get listed when trying to list all available tasks.\r\nAm I missing something on how `resolveTask()` is supposed to work, or is there a bug here ? I've tried looking at other task providers, but every single one of them only use `provideTasks()`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33522","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33522/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33522/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33522/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33522","id":254029584,"number":33522,"title":"Automatic
