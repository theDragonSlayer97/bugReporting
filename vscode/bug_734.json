(27'') from a Lenovo x240. If the code window is maximized I get occasional flickering in the side bar and the status bar. This only happens when the VGA connected screen is active. Also in full screen (F11) or when the Code-window is not maximized the flickering does not seem to appear. Other programs are not affected by similar flickering either as it seems. I use the standard window manager for this version of Ubuntu. I did not have similar problems before today when I started to use the multi-screen setup.\n\nSome hardware details\nIntel® Core™ i7-4600U CPU @ 2.10GHz × 4 , 8GB Ram\nIntel® Haswell Mobile\n\nI realize that this probably is related to other things than Code, but the manifestation of these problems could at least be noted. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Maximize window on a multi-screen setup\n2. Observe occasional flickering\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13740","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13740/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13740/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13740/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13740","id":182996783,"number":13740,"title":"Add
