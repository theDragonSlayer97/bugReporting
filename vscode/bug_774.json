VSCode Version: 1.5.1\n- OS Version: 10.11.6 (15G1004)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create an extension that uses `vscode.previewHtml` command to open an URI that is registered to `TextDocumentContentProvider`\n2. Generate a document that contains a link to a file URI to a specific line. I've noticed the file needs to be in the current project that is open. If it's not, the bug doesn't appear.\n3. The link doesn't work when it has also a line reference, without it it works.\n\nFor example I was able to reproduce the issue with the extension below. Execute the command when there's a file open in the project. The URI to the file to a specific line doesn't work, but the URI to the same file without line specified it works.\n\n``` javascript\n\"use strict\";\n\nconst vscode = require(\"vscode\");\n\nconst

VSCode Version: 1.5.3 (5be4091987a98e3870d89d630eb87be6d9bafd27)\n- OS Version: macOS Sierra 10.12\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n- Create an empty directory\n- Run `npm init` and then `npm i --save-dev typescript`\n- Run `tsc --init` (or `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --init`)\n- Create `test.ts` and add code that's using `Map` and `Set`:\n\n``` typescript\nconst foo = new Map();\nconst bar = new Set();\n```\n- Edit `tsconfig.json`, set `target` to be `es2015`, and add `files` section with the test script (`test`) without its extension:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n        \"target\": \"es2015\",\n        \"noImplicitAny\": false,\n        \"sourceMap\": false\n    },\n    \"files\": [ \"test\" ]\n}\n```\n- Run `tsc` (or `./node_modules/.bin/tsc`), see that `test.js` is created with exactly the same code, as expected, and no warnings or errors have been seen.\n\nAt this point, `tsc` compiled the file `test` while adding the default `.ts` extension when resolving.\n\nNow adding VSCode into the picture:\n- Run `code .` to open VSCode with the current testing directory loaded. Either that, or from GUI go to `Files > Open` and loaded the current directory.\n- Open `test.ts` file. At this point VSCode may ask about TypeScript version, if TypeScript 2.0 was installed by npm. It doesn't matter whether you choose TS 2.0 or TS 1.8, both produce the same behavior.\n- Observe `Map` and `Set` being unrecognized:\n  <img width=\"583\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-09-23 at 22 31 53\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9551921/18800492/93defa6e-81dd-11e6-8511-992ec277e43e.png\">\n\nThe observed behavior is inconsistent with `tsc`.\n\nNow, to \"fix\" it:\n- Open `tsconfig.json` and change the `files` section to have the full file-name with its extension `test.ts`.\n- Reload TypeScript project or reload VSCode, and open `test.ts`. Everything is fine now.\n  <img width=\"612\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-09-23 at 22 30 14\"

`tsc`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12546","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12546/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12546/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12546/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12546","id":178951527,"number":12546,"title":"Unclear

Open code in left and right side editors\n2. Observe the following real-estate usage. Suggestions follow.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/494055/18796085/8799463a-817c-11e6-9241-39deb27b5a90.png)\n\nThe blue lines mark the edges of the non-code sidebar for the right-side editor. The line numbers are rendered in dark grey in the same font as the code which is a good thing, no wasted space there. The light grey line to the left of the left blue line is the boundary of the scrollbar. No complaints there -- we can even see code through the scrollbar which is a major plus.\n\nProblem areas are outlined by the red bars. Nothing seems to go in that space (that I've seen so far). The gap between the breakpoint markers and the code folding buttons is unnecessarily large. They are so different in appearance from the numbers there's no chance of confusing them. They can be closer together. When my view is three panels wide I'm losing what feels like a ton of screen space compared to other editors.\n\nAnother view which makes this problem more clear:\n\nSet `\"editor.lineNumbers\": false`\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/494055/18796404/f3ca7f08-817d-11e6-96ad-d19d22c3ed18.png)\n\nBlue: 50 px for the activity bar (being discussed [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1105))\nGreen: 45 px for each of the editor's left margin areas - when they are not even displaying line numbers! There's nothing to see there. I'd assert we should not be using all of that horizontal real estate when there's nothing to see.\n\nLet's assume side-by-side editing with two editor panels is a common scenario. Right now there is about 140px of Nothing-To-See-Here space (except when mousing over the margin, where you get the option to fold code and set breakpoints).\n\nSome of this space can be saved as a no-brainer (it's just unnecessary padding):\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/494055/18796857/00968004-8180-11e6-8647-c4384d1b8d1c.png)\n\nRed bars above are unnecessary padding: 4px, 12px, 5px respectively. Zoomed view:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/494055/18796931/5d31024e-8180-11e6-890f-a2cd75482446.png)\n\nBeing able to [hide the activity bar](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1105) would save 50px for those who want to hide it.\n\nSome languages don't support breakpoints. We can save another 10-12px per editor margin for those languages by not reserving that space for the breakpoint icons.\n\nMaybe I'm not interested in folding any code? Add a configuration option or Command to toggle that ability and remove that part of the margin when it won't be used. This saves another 10-11px.\n\nThanks for listening! :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12543/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12542","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12542/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12542/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12542/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12542","id":178942121,"number":12542,"title":"Git
