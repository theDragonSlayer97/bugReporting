in sync as I scroll one or the other. For example, if I scroll down in the raw pane, I'd like the preview pane to scroll down as well so the markdown and preview stay in sync with each other. This is a feature found in MarkdownPad, my current/previous markdown editor, that I'd like to see in VS Code as well.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6992/reactions","total_count":28,"+1":28,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6991","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6991/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6991/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6991/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6991","id":157350400,"number":6991,"title":"[folding] Optionally fold chained method calls","user":{"login":"aaronhoffman","id":109249,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/109249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronhoffman","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronhoffman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronhoffman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronhoffman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronhoffman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronhoffman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronhoffman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronhoffman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronhoffman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronhoffman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronhoffman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-28T18:09:23Z","updated_at":"2016-05-30T11:59:16Z","closed_at":"2016-05-30T11:59:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For frameworks that expose a fluent API (ex: [d3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3)), it is common to chain method calls on separate lines. Example [here](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/):\n\n```\nd3.select(\".chart\")\n  .selectAll(\"div\")\n  .data(data)\n  .enter()\n  .append(\"div\")\n  .style(\"width\", function(d) { return d * 10 + \"px\"; })\n  .text(function(d) { return d; });\n```\n\nCurrently, the vscode `editor.foldAll` command folds these chained method calls and hides everything except the first line `d3.select(\".chart\")...`. It would be nice to optionally enable/disable this functionality based on your use case. (In my case, I would disable it by default for all languages.)\n\nLikely related to folding not being language aware:
