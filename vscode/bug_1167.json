moving `vscode-go` from applying full-document-replacement edits to [applying multiple targeted edits for formatting](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/111), I'm seeing one odd case.\n\nWhen the formatter asks to replace 4 spaces with a tab, we compute the two edits below:\n\n``` json\n[\n {\n  \"_range\": {\n   \"_start\": {\n    \"_line\": 3,\n    \"_character\": 0\n   },\n   \"_end\": {\n    \"_line\": 3,\n    \"_character\": 4\n   }\n  },\n  \"_newText\": \"\"\n },\n {\n  \"_range\": {\n   \"_start\": {\n    \"_line\": 3,\n    \"_character\": 4\n   },\n   \"_end\": {\n    \"_line\": 3,\n    \"_character\": 4\n   }\n  },\n  \"_newText\": \"\\t\"\n }\n]\n```\n\nBut when we return these edits, they do not get applied.  Worse, if these edits are part of a set of 20 edits, none of the edits get applied.  And worse, we get no error returned to us or reported to the user about these edits being invalid.\n\nIs this an illegal edit, and if so why?\n\nIs it expected that we don't get any feedback about the edits being incorrect?\n\n/cc
