Create the example project outlined below. (This is a valid program than runs under Node.)\n2. Intellisense for imports within ./index.js does not work.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n// ./jsconfig.json\n\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"es6\",\n        \"module\": \"commonjs\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```\n// ./index.js\n\nvar hello = require('foo');\n\nconsole.log(hello('world'));\n```\n\n```\n// ./node_modules/foo/index.js\n\nmodule.exports = function(name) {\n    return 'hello ' + name;\n}\n```\n\nWith VS Code opened to the folder designated by the dot (.) in the paths above, there is no meaningful Intellisense provided for symbol \"hello\" in ./index.js.  Why not?\n\nI did notice that, if an appropriate ./node_modules/foo/index.d.ts file is added, then Intellisense appears.  But, I can't and/or don't want to use a Typescript definition for every module in my program.\n\nIn any case, TypeScript embellishment is beside the point...   I thought VS Code was _supposed_ to provide some minimum useful Intellisense even for plain Javascript, no?  The advertised \"rich editing support\" features for Javascript described at https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/javascript certainly implied as much to me.\n\nI mean, the static analysis engine should at least be able to infer that the default export of module \"foo\" is a function, with a parameter called \"name\", returning \"any\", right?\n\nOr, do I not understand what the following feature descriptions (quoted from the aforementioned web page) are trying to say?\n\n> IntelliSense\n> The JavaScript Support uses different strategies to provide IntelliSense.\n> \n> IntelliSense based on type inference\n> JavaScript uses the same inference as TypeScript to determine the type of a value.\n> \n> The following patterns are also recognized:\n> \n> \"ES3-style\" classes, specified using a constructor function and assignments to the prototype property.\n> CommonJS-style module patterns, specified as property assignments on the exports object, or assignments to the module.exports property.\n\nThe \"IntelliSense based on type inference\" and \"CommonJS-style module patterns\" is what initially caught my eye when looking into using VS Code for my Javascript work.\n\nBut, when I tried the example code shown above, in an attempt to test out both of these features, I could not get them to work even in the simplest of toy projects.\n\nAm I doing something wrong?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5713","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5713/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5713/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5713/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5713","id":150642817,"number":5713,"title":"Improve

Open a CSS file with the following contents (note spacing is important)\n   \n   ```\n   .foo {\n   background: linear-gradient(180deg,white 0%);\n   }\n   ```\n2. That `background:` line needs to be indented. Position the cursor at the beginning of that line.\n3. Press tab to try to indent it.\n4. Result: VS Code adds a bunch more lines, which are not indented:\n   \n   ```\n   .foo {\n   background: -webkit-linear-gradient(white 0%);\n   background: -o-linear-gradient(white 0%);\n   background: linear-gradient(white 0%);\n   }\n   ```\n5. No, that's not what I want! Undo! Undo! (Cmd-Z)\n6. VS Code deletes the file contents.\n\nThe two unexpected behaviors are:\n1. Tab should adjust indentation, not do whatever it did in step 4.\n2. Undo should undo the last change, not clear the file as in step 6.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5700","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5700/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5700/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5700/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5700","id":150591856,"number":5700,"title":"Question: Provision to show ESLint error/warning for whole project.","user":{"login":"shripalsoni04","id":4411891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4411891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shripalsoni04","html_url":"https://github.com/shripalsoni04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shripalsoni04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shripalsoni04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shripalsoni04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shripalsoni04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shripalsoni04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shripalsoni04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shripalsoni04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shripalsoni04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shripalsoni04/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"egamma","id":172399,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/172399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma","html_url":"https://github.com/egamma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"egamma","id":172399,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/172399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma","html_url":"https://github.com/egamma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-23T20:05:38Z","updated_at":"2016-04-24T01:43:22Z","closed_at":"2016-04-24T01:43:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have added eslint extension in vscode.
