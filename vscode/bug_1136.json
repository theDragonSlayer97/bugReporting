working on the PowerShell extension, we need to allow users to be able to choose whether to launch a 32-bit or a 64-bit debug host.  Certain PowerShell modules will only load into one or the other.\n\nI see that there is support for different `program:` settings per OS:\n\n``` json\n\"debuggers\": [{\n    \"type\": \"gdb\",\n    \"windows\": {\n        \"program\": \"./bin/gdbDebug.exe\",\n    },\n```\n\nWhat I would like to see is `windows` remain as \"use the default OS architecture\" and you add `windows (x86)` to allow extension developers to specify a different, x86 host exe on 64-bit Windows e.g.: \n\n``` json\n\"debuggers\": [{\n    \"type\": \"gdb\",\n    \"windows\": {\n        \"program\": \"./bin/gdbDebug.exe\",\n    },\n    \"windows (x86)\": {\n        \"program\": \"./bin/gdbDebug.x86.exe\",\n    },\n```\n\nIdeally, on a 32-bit system, the use of `windows (x86)` would never appear to the end user just as `linux` or `osx` would not appear as debug targets.  However on 64-bit Windows the user would need to be able to select between the 64-bit debug host and the 32-bit (x86) debug host.  I'm not sure what the \"UI\" would be for this.  \n\nOne option is that we just add another debugger intialConfiguration. So for the PowerShell extension, we would have:\n\n``` json\n\"initialConfigurations\": [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"PowerShell\",\n        \"type\": \"PowerShell\",\n        \"request\": \"launch\",\n        \"program\": \"${file}\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"PowerShell (x86)\",\n        \"type\": \"PowerShell\",\n        \"request\": \"launch\",\n        \"program\": \"${file}\"\n    }                    \n]\n```\n\nThe problem is that with this approach - using `windows` and `windows (x86)` to distinguish between host architectures - is that the `type:` setting would not be any different. Both hosts would be defined under `type: \"PowerShell\"`.  I'm not familiar enough with the debugger section of the package.json format to figure this out.  \n\nI could create two different debugger sections, one type `PowerShell` and the other type `PowerShell (x86)`.  However that forces a one time choice when the launch.json file gets configured and that doesn't seem right.  The user is likely going to want to switch between OS native and x86 depending on the script they are debugging.\n\nAnother option, would require smarts in the Debug viewlet's toolbar dropdown.  It would recognize both `windows` and `windows (x86)` and take a single \"name\" e.g.:\n\n``` json\n\"initialConfigurations\": [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"PowerShell\",\n        \"type\": \"PowerShell\",\n        \"request\": \"launch\",\n        \"program\": \"${file}\"\n    }             \n]\n```\n\n... and create two entries in the dropdown: `PowerShell` and `PowerShell (x86)`.  Hmm, not sure I like that option myself.\n\nAnother option is to allow the initialConfigurations sections to specify `programArgs:` to the launched program. Then we could write a small CMD file to take the args and launch the correct debug host exe.  That we can create `PowerShell` and `PowerShell (x86)` named configurations that will automatically show up in the Debuggers' debug target dropdown list.  \n\nOr another option is to have an initialConfiguration section property that would allow the selection of `windows` or `windows (x86)`. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1695","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1695/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1695/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1695/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1695","id":124267780,"number":1695,"title":"Make soft text wrapping easier discoverable","user":{"login":"egamma","id":172399,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/172399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma","html_url":"https://github.com/egamma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":296838217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/ux","name":"ux","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":8,"created_at":"2015-12-29T21:02:46Z","updated_at":"2016-03-12T17:00:42Z","closed_at":"2016-03-12T16:28:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We are receiving regular questions about how to enable soft text wrapping.

can I extend basic HTML language with another syntax without disabling the basic HTML? It seems that there are some things, that are still hardcoded into VSCode core and linked to text.html.basic that I loose if I use a html-based language that is not the text.html.basic.\n\nIn my case I'm trying to integrate Nunjucks templater into VSCode. I used the generator, and tried the plugin some other guy made (basically the same thing). And it boils down to the fact that I'm trading Nunjucks syntax coloring against all the cool staff basic VSC HTML offers (emmet, tag closing...). Legit HTML tag suggestions became replaced with some random on-the-fly-generated garbage and the coloring of the HTML syntax in Nunjucks language  plugin is inconsistent with the basic one anyway. On the other hand HTML is bickering about the errors in the script tags, if nunj is used there... So not worth it.\n\nIs there a way already - if yes what is it?

quite figure out why I'm not getting intellisense for ES6 features in a TypeScript file.\n\nI'm fairly certain it is related to the _lib.d.ts_ file that is used in the typescript source files.

When going to definition on a method that is defined by the base interface definition files, it points you to lib.d.ts and not the es6 version. The es6 version has all of the interfaces that I need.\n\nThat said, even if I include some ES6 methods and force the task runner(which under the hood uses the typescript compiler installed), it doesn't transpile to ES5 like I expected it to.\n\nMaybe my TypeScript compiler version is dated? Primarily I want these features:\n\nSymbol\nArray.prototype.includes\nString.prototype.includes\nI see these interfaces defined in the es6 typing definition file. Is there a way to get VSCode to recognize this? I'm thinking a hacky approach of just including that lib file in my project but I'm trying to avoid that and in the end it still doesn't solve my problem when I transpile to ES5 and get
