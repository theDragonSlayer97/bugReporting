Suppose for example the user has typed:\r\n\r\n    someValue.someMeth\r\n\r\nWe would like to autocomplete `someValue.someMethod()` and place the users cursor between parentheses. This is possible using snippets:\r\n\r\n    CompletionItem { label: someMethod, insertText: someMethod($0), insertTextFormat: 2 }\r\n\r\nThe problem is that signatureHelp relies on the trigger character `(`, and it doesn't get activated when the `(` is inserted as part of the snippet.\r\n\r\nThis problem does not come up in languages like Typescript, because the expression `someValue.someMethod` is well-defined as a reference to `someMethod`. But in Java, method references have a different syntax `someValue::someMethod`. So we know the user will always type `(`, but we don't autocomplete it.\r\n\r\nThere are two possible solutions to this, one at the VSCode level and one at the language-server-protocol level:\r\n1. VSCode solution: if the character before `$0` in a snippet is a signatureHelp trigger character, activate signatureHelp.\r\n1. LSP solution: add a property `CompletionItem { ... activateSignatureHelp: boolean }` that activates signature-help immediately following completion.\r\n\r\nI filed a corresponding issue in the language-server-protocol repo: https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/issues/274","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31289","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31289/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31289/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31289/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31289","id":244949220,"number":31289,"title":"How much time Microsoft intends to employ on VSCode?","user":{"login":"evandrocoan","id":5332158,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5332158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/evandrocoan","html_url":"https://github.com/evandrocoan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evandrocoan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evandrocoan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evandrocoan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evandrocoan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evandrocoan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evandrocoan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evandrocoan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evandrocoan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evandrocoan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-07-24T00:58:26Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T03:40:08Z","closed_at":"2017-07-27T03:40:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It is very awesome the time employed by Microsoft workers/employers on developing VSCode, however how much time this dream is pretend to last?\r\n\r\nAs we may known every project has a determinate end, however the software life cycle never dies. There is always the maintenance process the project needs as minor changes and fixes from its dependencies updates, i.e., to be kept up to date with the state of the art.\r\n\r\nCurrently we may notice heavily contributions from the Microsoft team, but exactly how much time they are going to be present on the project? \r\n\r\nAll of them are going to be committed for ever working with VSCode development? I can assume some of the, may be relocated to new projects. But this project is planed to be kept powered by Microsoft for how long and with how many man hours over the time period?\r\n\r\nI can think that Microsoft has escalated, set goals of development to be achieved by this project, and after a certain time this project would end and a new project as a maintenance project would be place in action to provided maintenance for the project.\r\n\r\nWho am I and why all those questions? I am just curious to see what is on the Microsoft's mind. Thought, I am coming from Sublime Text, a closed source project. I have been developing third part packages for it, but the Sublime Text development team does not bring much confidence on whether they can fix the core problems I have been experiencing. Therefore I am planing to move on to some new project which I can engage and not worry about unsolvable problems as low community support and segmentation faults on the software core.\r\n\r\nOn this context, or even today's context, the community support (a private team of workers also very welcome), is very important for the tool development not to stop and end up outdated. So here the point is, if I am going to be the only one working it, I am scrolled. Only by myself I cannot accomplish much in my whole life time. Hence where a great overall community support can help to solve the problem and keep the software in awesome shape.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31288","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31288/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31288/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31288/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31288","id":244942112,"number":31288,"title":"Multi
