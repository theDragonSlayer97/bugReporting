that VS Code is open source, it also means that the [Monaco Editor is open source](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/src/vs/editor) _(at-least to some extent)_.\n\nI would really like to use this editor in my own web application for editing TypeScript files. The only problem is I can't find any documentation about how to do this. I know its possible because the editor is on [TypeScript Playground](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground) and [a few other places](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ARichNewJavaScriptCodeEditorSpreadingToSeveralMicrosoftWebSites.aspx). \n\nAs far as I can tell, the open sourcing of VS Code is the first time the source code of the Monaco editor has been made public. Also, I think that the VS Code repository is the primary source of the Monaco editor _(someone from Microsoft please confirm?)_. \n\nSo far, there have been many questions about using the Monaco Editor on Stack Overflow and other forums, but I have yet to see an official reply from Microsoft. \n\n**Can someone please provide some documentation on using the Monaco Editor in a web site, or perhaps release the source code of TypeScript Playground** _(There is nothing to hide now that we have the Monaco source in the VS Code repository)_. \n\nCurrently, the only thing keeping me from using TypeScript as a JavaScript replacement is the fact that I can't easily use the Monaco Editor inside of my web application. I'm currently using the ACE Editor with a  [Tern plugin I created](http://sevin7676.github.io/Ace.Tern/demo.html#javascript). I don't want to go through all of the work of creating full Intellisense support for TypeScript inside of ACE because its a significant undertaking- Instead I'd rather contribute to the Monaco editor and use it as a replacement for ACE (and replace JavaScript with TypeScript).
