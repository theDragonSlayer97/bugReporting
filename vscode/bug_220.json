Suppose that you are focused on the 4th file from the result, replace the selection 'document' with 'activeDocument' (it also matches the original search term) or with 'window' (it doesn't match the original search term); both will trigger this issue\r\n4.

rerun automatically, but if you change some other text in the active editor that is not selected by the 'focus next search result', the focus will jump to the 5th result in the example from the steps

to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open VS Code, edit TSX file\r\n2. leave editor open, run \"node install\" in project\r\n3. npm install takes over a minute longer than when not running VS Code,\r\n\r\nNPM often hangs on a line such as this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[       ...........] - extract:fsevents: verb lock using C:\\Users\\alshain\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm-cache\\_locks\\staging-3d5cc763a76e1aa2.lock for c:\\Users\\alshain\\Documents\\typescript\\node_modules\\.staging\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter a long wait time, npm will output something like (always EPERM, rename):\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, rename 'c:\\Users\\alshain\\Documents\\typescript\\.staging\\fsevents-ca317142\\node_modules\\boom' -> 'c:\\Users\\alshain\\Documents\\typescript\\node_modules\\.staging\\boom-1ae2831a'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether this is random, but VS Code seems not to acquire a lock in .staging very often when editing the settings for instance.\r\n\r\nI was also able to confirm VS Code having a handle in .staging using process explorer a few times.\r\n\r\nOnce, I also got some kind of info popup in VS Code about it not being able to load completions or type definitions or whatever and it also mentioned a file inside the node_modules/.staging directory.\r\n\r\nThe problem *always* goes away when closing VS Code.\r\n\r\n**Apparent fix**: adding this to my user settings:\r\n```json\r\n    \"files.watcherExclude\": {\r\n        \"**/.git/objects/**\": true,\r\n        \"**/.git/subtree-cache/**\": true,\r\n        \"**/node_modules/*/**\": true,\r\n       // Note the dot before the asterisk\r\n        \"**/node_modules/.*/**\": true\r\n

makes our file watcher for compilation use the NSFW file watcher (from https://github.com/Axosoft/nsfw) to get more coverage on the quality of file events. There is an environment variable `vscode.disableNewWatcher` to force disable this if needed (thus I did not delete the old code yet).\r\n\r\nMost of the code is copied out of the Windows watcher we already had: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/ben/nsfw/build/lib/watch/watch-win32.js\r\n\r\nThe only thing needed was to convert the file events from NSFW to the gulp format that we need (including converting rename events to DELETE and ADD). Though I wonder if we would benefit in any way from knowing that a file was renamed in terms of better recompilation?\r\n\r\n/cc @jrieken @alexandrudima @joaomoreno

development describes a setup in which VS Code is used to edit files that reside on a different computer which file system cannot be mounted. A server that only offers FTP is an example of such a setup. \r\n\r\nThe following features should be supported for good dev experience\r\n\r\n* see resources in the explorer, either as separate view or inline with the open folder/folders\r\n* open (text) files, modify, save, and revert them. Lots of thoughts about this have been written down in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10547#issuecomment-308019094 and https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29025\r\n* support file events from the remote source being reflected in the editor, e.g. update explorer, close editors, invalidate search caches etc. \r\n* allow to search for files by their name in the same way we do it today using <kbd>Cmd+P</kdb>\r\n* allow to search inside files, again merging with the existing search experience. \r\n* think about language services/servers which today usually rely on having disk-access to files\r\n\r\nThe goal is to enable remote development via extensions, so new provider APIs are required to allow 3rd parties to integrate into more pieces of our system. Similar to #29025 we start with assessing how many assumptions are backed into our system and how we can make it aware of having multiple sources of truth, e.g. multiple search result providers, etc,
