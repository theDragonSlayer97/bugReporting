have many ways to talk about models and editors and while it might have made sense back then we should consider to consolidate them. Let's start by taking inventory:\n\nOn the service side we have:\n1. IEditorService (in platform/editor/common)\n2. IWorkbenchEditorService (in workbench/services/editor)\n3. ICodeEditorService (in editor/common/services)\n4. IModelService (in editor/common/services)\n\nThe latter two use editor types like `IModel`, `ICodeEditor` etc while the former two abstract them away, like `IEditor` and `ITextEditorModel`.  Tho, those abstractions are very weak and often you encounter code like this: `let editor = this.editorService.getActiveEditor(); this.lastKnownEditorViewState = (<IEditor>editor.getControl()).saveViewState();`\n\nI think this needs simplification in the face of the challenge of building a simple API that hides all of this. Also, there are semantic differences, like `IWorkbenchEditorService` not knowing anything about inline-editors and `ICodeEditorService` not knowing anything about the _active_ editor etc. \n\nLet's collection more issues and let's discuss @alexandrudima @bpasero

https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/165 for how this was discovered and how it effects the go extension, where I initially encountered the problem (reproduction instructions are available in [this comment](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/165#issuecomment-166618653)).\n\nIn short: since the `gorename` tool seems to always convert the document's line endings to `LF`, running it once when the endings are initially `CRLF` may seem to work at first, but at the second time, (when the endings are changed to `LF`) since the extension host still calculates offsets based on `CRLF` the tool would give what seemed like 'strange' errors about invalid offsets that didn't seem to make sense at first. Changing line endings using the UI itself didn't seem to matter, but reopening the file 'magically' fixed it.\n\nTracing this into the vscode source: in `extHostDocuments.ts`, within the `BaseTextDocument` class it seems like the [`_eol` property](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/70ee90dcc1c9a3094ae2ba94f8d0c210a72e499e/src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostDocuments.ts#L185) is not updated when the line endings change. This means that the [`offsetAt` function](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/70ee90dcc1c9a3094ae2ba94f8d0c210a72e499e/src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostDocuments.ts#L185) may return invalid values. Fixing this might not be sufficient. In order to force the [`_ensureLineStarts` function](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/70ee90dcc1c9a3094ae2ba94f8d0c210a72e499e/src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostDocuments.ts#L329) to recalculate the line offsets it seems that the [`_lineStarts` object](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/70ee90dcc1c9a3094ae2ba94f8d0c210a72e499e/src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostDocuments.ts#L190) needs to be reset every time that the line endings change (this includes cases where they are changed by an external tool or editor). I would recommend this should also handle the case where only a _single_ (or some) line ending changes (meaning the line endings are inconsistent), as in some rare cases some external tools may modify the text in this way.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1579","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1579/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1579/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1579/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1579","id":123502060,"number":1579,"title":"Sanity
