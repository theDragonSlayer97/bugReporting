x));\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\nSince a single star glob pattern is used, I initially thought these watchers should only fire when a top level ts file is changed.

The globWatcher is correctly only fired for ts files in the root\r\n\r\nFrom the documentation of RelativeWatcher, I think this behavior is expected since the glob is only applied to the file. \r\n\r\nTo get the glob `*` behavior, I also tried patterns such as:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n new RelativePattern(\r\n        vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0],\r\n        './*.ts')\r\n```\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n```ts\r\nnew RelativePattern(\r\n        vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0],\r\n        '\\\\*.ts')\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing these, the relative watcher is never fired.
