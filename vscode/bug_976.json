I could solve the issue like this \n\n``` json\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"windows\" : {\n        \"command\": \"cmd\",\n        \"args\" : [\"/c\"]\n    },\n    \"suppressTaskName\": true,    \n    \"tasks\": [\n        {\n            \"taskName\": \"build\",\n            \"args\": [\"dotnet build\"],\n            \"isBuildCommand\": true            \n        },\n        {\n            \"taskName\": \"buildDocker\",\n            \"args\": [\"dotnetdocker build\"],\n            \"isBuildCommand\": true            \n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nBut this requires spinning up an extra shell. It would be better if the task allows fully overriding the command. That would simplify the tasks.json to something like\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"command\": \"dotnet\",\n    \"isShellCommand\": true,\n    \"args\": [],\n    \"tasks\": [\n        {\n            \"taskName\": \"build\",\n            \"args\": [],\n            \"isBuildCommand\": true,\n            \"problemMatcher\": \"$msCompile\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"overrideCommand\": true,\n            \"taskName\": \"buildDocker\",\n            \"command\":\"dotnetdocker\"\n            \"args\": [\"build\"],\n            \"isBuildCommand\": true,\n

Install an old version of some extension, like v1.\n2. When the extension is updated, update the extension, this  new version like v2, will be installed in a different path.\n\nIn this design, it seems hard for extension developer to put necessary files(e.g., a cache/history file needs to persisted during extension usage) into the extension path, since in new version, the file is missing, needs to be regenerated.\n\nSo if we could have multiple versions of same extension have same path, in that case the cache/history file can be used when extension is updated.\n\nI am not sure if this request is reasonable, or I just should put this kind of files to a fixed place on machine

Create a  `TypeScript` project with the following structure : \n   `tsconfig.json`\n   `app/`\n   `app/application.ts`\n   `app/framework/`\n   `app/framework/application.ts (included in application.ts)`\n   `app/framework/some other typescripts files (included in framework/application.ts)`\n   `app/appNameHere/`\n   `app/appNameHere/application.ts (included in application.ts)`\n   `app/appNameHere/some other typescripts files (included in appNameHere/application.ts)`\n   \n   So basically : \n   - `app/application.ts` will only contain references to `framework/application.ts` and `appNameHere/application.ts`.\n   - `app/framework/application.ts` will only contain references to files from `framework` folder.\n   - `app/appNameHere/application.ts` will only contain references to files from `appNameHere` folder.\n2. Create a `tsconfig.json` as follow : \n   `{\n   \"compileOnSave\": true,\n   \"compilerOptions\": {\n       \"target\": \"es5\",\n       \"removeComments\": true,\n       \"outFile\": \"application.js\",\n       \"sourceMap\": true,\n       \"noImplicitAny\": true\n   },\n   \"files\": [\n       \"app/application.ts\"\n   ]\n   }`\n3. Add some TS files in both directory and play with it, try using intellisense of a class from another file\n4. Up at some point, TypeScript intellisense seems to crash and to get it again, we need to restart vscode\n\nThe Intellisense is crashing a lot in one day on my side with that settings at my job, it will say it doesn't know what is a class that should be defined, until you restart vscode ...\n\nIf you need more informations, I'll be glad to offer them. However, I am not in the ability to share my projet as it is confidential files from my job.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6484","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6484/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6484/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6484/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6484","id":155533097,"number":6484,"title":"Command line argument documentation and a '--help' option","user":{"login":"Lindenk","id":2438655,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2438655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lindenk","html_url":"https://github.com/Lindenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lindenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lindenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lindenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lindenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lindenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lindenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lindenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lindenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lindenk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":18,"created_at":"2016-05-18T15:33:56Z","updated_at":"2017-03-26T01:12:10Z","closed_at":"2016-05-18T19:03:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello!\n\nVisual Studio Code seems to accept command line arguments for some things, such as disabling extentions and openning to a given path, however they do not seem to be documented anywhere (that I can easily find at least).
