all\n\nIs there a way to sync intellisense with custom build tasks? I am working in a TypeScript project, and as I understand it, Code reads the tsconfig.json to do its intellisense (among other things). However my compilation is done through a gulp task. This task reports errors for me and I've setup a problem matcher to catch those. The problem comes in however when there seems to be a mismatch between the service generating intellisense and the build process I am using. I can build my project for example (using the gulp task) and no errors will show up - however I can go to a file and see red squiggles under things that have no errors. Are there ways I can sync the intellisense with my tasks?\n\nThis is my tasks json:\n\n```\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"command\": \"gulp\",\n    \"isShellCommand\": true,\n    \"args\": [\n         \"--no-color\"\n    ],\n    \"tasks\": [\n    {\n        \"taskName\": \"build-all\",\n        \"isBuildCommand\": true,\n        \"showOutput\": \"silent\",\n        \"problemMatcher\": {\n            \"fileLocation\": [\"relative\", \"${workspaceRoot}\"],\n            \"pattern\": {\n                \"regexp\": \"^(.*)\\\\((.*),(.*)\\\\):\\\\s(error|warning)\\\\s(.*)$\",\n

am attempting to modify the Git History extension to use virtual documents instead of temp files, but I am running into issues while executing the `workbench.files.action.compareFileWith` command.\n\nIf I open the virtual file first, then run the `compareFileWith` command, I get an error stating `Open a file first to compare it with another file.`, which would result from `workbenchEditorCommon.asFileEditorInput(this.editorService.getActiveEditorInput());` returning falsy.\n\nAttempting the compare in reverse (open disk file, then compare, then open virtual file) I get an exception `Notification handler 'textDocument/publishDiagnostics' failed with message: Illegal argument: line must be positive` that appears to be caused by the fact that `babel-eslint` can't be loaded.\n\nI haven't figured out how to debug the `GlobalCompareResourcesAction` directly yet, but I'll keep on digging.
