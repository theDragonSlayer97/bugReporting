VSCode Version: 1.3.1 (But occurred in earlier versions)\n- OS Version: Windows 10.0.10586\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

Use it for a bit, then close it cleanly by exiting the app.\n4. Make the attached monitor as \"Make this my main display\" from the Display settings (right click on the desktop).\n5. Launch VS Code again.\n\nYou will sometimes see that the new window VS code generates is completely off screen.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nMake sure that the new  window will not go off-screen, but at least the top of the window to be visible on the visible area on either of the monitors so that I can click it and move it to the place I would like. \n\nWorkaround:\n\nMake the laptop screen the main screen, then re-launch the VS Code, or temporarily disconnect the other

VSCode Version: 1.3.1\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nI'm developing an extension which needs to send content changes to a separate service that is doing analysis. I'm using the `onDidChangeTextDocument` event.\n\nEverything works fine if I'm only typing with one cursor; however if I use `Alt` to place multiple cursors, then I get the wrong offsets from `offsetAt` (presumably because it's using the new state of the document, not the one that the `Position` supplied was based on).\n\nExample:\n\nCreate a file that contains two commented lines and no whitespace, but CrLfs:\n\n```\n//\n//\n```\n\nPlace your cursor on the end of the second line and type a character. You'll get an event saying the edit is on Line 1, Character 2 (this is correct, it's zero-based):\n\n```\n{\"range\":[{\"line\":1,\"character\":2},{\"line\":1,\"character\":2}],\"rangeLength\":0,\"text\":\"a\"},\n```\n\nIf you feed this into `document.offsetAt` you will get back 6 (this is also correct; you have `SLASH` `SLASH` `CR` `LF` `SLASH` `SLASH` preceding it:\n\n```\ne.document.offsetAt(e.contentChanges[0].range.start) // 6\n```\n\nNow do the same thing, but with multiple edit cursors - one at the end of each line. You'll get an event for both lines at Character 2 (again, correct):\n\n```\n{\"range\":[{\"line\":1,\"character\":2},{\"line\":1,\"character\":2}],\"rangeLength\":0,\"text\":\"a\"},\n{\"range\":[{\"line\":0,\"character\":2},{\"line\":0,\"character\":2}],\"rangeLength\":0,\"text\":\"a\"}\n```\n\nHowever, if you feed these into `document.offsetAt`, the first one (which is the change lower down the document) will return 7!\n\n```\ne.document.offsetAt(e.contentChanges[0].range.start) // 7\n```\n\nMy guess is that it's because `offsetAt` is now seeing the `a` inserted on the first line, shifting the calculation.\n\nPossible fix might be to provide the original document in the `TextDocumentChangeEvent`?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4505","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"A55E:366F:CB5CC4:18D493D:59D94279","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=858>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=856>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d007bf2c0db383b732844fbae3ffe6a2\"","status":"200 OK"}}
