Putting the cursor on `myConstants` and pressing F12 correctly opens `constants/my-constants.js`\r\n2. Putting the cursor on `myConstants`, right-clicking and choosing Go to Type Definition correctly opens `constants/my-constants.js`\r\n3. Putting the cursor on `Spinner` and pressing F12 shows the \"No Definition Found\" tooltip. **This is unexpected.**\r\n3. Putting the cursor on `Spinner`, right-clicking and choosing Go to Type Definition correctly opens `components/spinner.js`\r\n\r\nThere is something specific about this project causing this behavior, since F12 seems to work correctly for JSX tags in other projects. F12 also used to work normally for this project in the past. I don't know how to further debug this.\r\n\r\nThis project does not use TypeScript but I tried adding a `jsconfig.json` file to the project as per #22315, which did not change the behavior
