working on a new extension for a language, and I'd love the ability to add an item to the list shown when you create \"Tasks: Configure Task Runner\" command. If that's possible now, I just can't seem to find it in the documentation.\n\nSee the following quick-and-dirty mockup:\n\n![custom-task-runner](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/141885/16858868/fcade1fe-49de-11e6-8def-d9553460f643.png)\n\nWe can add custom items to \"Debug: open launch.json\" using contributes:debuggers in the extension's package.json, so there is precedence for this sort of thing.\n\nThe reason I would like this API is so that I can create a template for the tasks.json file that runs a specific executable, similar to how \"TypeScript - tsconfig.json\" runs \"tsc\" or \"MSBuild\" runs \"msbuild\". That's easier for users than having to choose \"Other\" and enter the details manually.\n\nThank you!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9309/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9308","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9308/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9308/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9308/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9308","id":165677970,"number":9308,"title":"Previewing files in folder marks them as unsaved","user":{"login":"pukhrajbal","id":1594975,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1594975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pukhrajbal","html_url":"https://github.com/pukhrajbal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pukhrajbal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pukhrajbal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pukhrajbal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pukhrajbal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pukhrajbal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pukhrajbal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pukhrajbal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pukhrajbal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pukhrajbal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":409283388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/caused-by-extension","name":"caused-by-extension","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-07-14T23:03:12Z","updated_at":"2016-07-16T17:46:11Z","closed_at":"2016-07-14T23:48:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.3.1\n- OS Version: Win 7\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

It was one of my favorite things about vscode. I can open and close editors when ever I want. Sometimes something is not relevant or I want more room for one file, so I will close other editors. Keeping files and editors separate lets you move around your codebase without worrying about losing history. I thought this was a bug at first, since I have both tabs and \"open editors\" hidden in the UI as I don't need or use them.\n\nVia twitter I heard these new split editor features were wildly requested. Feature requests are easy to make, but its hard to vote on _keeping_ a feature that you already like.\n\nMy suggestion would be to keep the awesome work you did with tabs, but maybe store all open files in a single list also. So any time you open a file, it gets pushed to that list, while also being associated to and editor for tabs and what not.\n\nThoughts?\n\n<3\n- VSCode Version:\n  1.3\n- OS Version:\n

Set VS Code settings.json to include \"window.openFilesInNewWindow\": false\n2. In your Source Depot setenv.cmd, set VS Code as your default editor with: set SDEDITOR=\"c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft VS Code\\code.exe\"\n3. Have VS Code open with a file loaded.  Doesn't matter what, just needs to already be open\n4.  From your enlistment, make a code change and run SD CHANGE\n   --> That should bring up a .tmp file to allow you to enter a description.  Instead, you get an error \"Unable to open 't18832t1.tmp': A system error occured (ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat 'c:\\temp\\system\\csrcrs1_refresh\\t18832t1.tmp').\"\n\nIf VS Code isn't already running prior to step 4, this works correctly.
