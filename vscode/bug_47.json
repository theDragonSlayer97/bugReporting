9-13-2017\r\nWindows 7\r\n\r\nWhile working on adding keyboard navigation (#32034) for global message notifications I ran into a tracking problem regarding how messages are queued and aggregated (eliminate common messages by text).\r\nThe problem is prepareMessages goes through the message queue from newest to oldest\r\nmessages.  If a new message is added that matches an older message, it can take a slot\r\nthat is not rendered but, will bump the older message from the rendered list.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to go backwards in the global list and make sure the older messages are rendered\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nI would like to do this PR before I do the full keyboard navigation PR.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce (requires test code):\r\n\r\n- Create a TestMessages command\r\n\t- Generates 6 test action messages (eliminate purged messages for simplicity)\r\n\t- Each of the six messages our unique eg Msg1 ... Msg6\r\n- Create a TestMessages2 command\r\n\t- Generates 1 test action message Msg1 (creates duplicate first message above)\r\n\r\n- Execute TestMessages\r\n\t- Results in the following message is being displayed:\r\n\tMsg5\r\n\tMsg4\r\n\tMsg3\r\n\tMsg2\r\n\tMsg1\r\n\t- Msg6 is added to the queue  but not shown (correct behavior so far)\r\n- Execute TestMessages2\r\n\t- Results in the following message is being displayed:\r\n\tMsg6\r\n\tMsg5\r\n\tMsg4\r\n\tMsg3\r\n\tMsg2\r\n\t- The new Msg1 gets processed by prepareMessages and added to handledMessages\r\n\t- The oldest Msg1 is that a duplicate and not rendered, but the five messages\r\n\t- rendered are the first five messages without the duplicate\r\n\t- Unless I am misunderstanding the design, I believe the following should be correct\r\n\tMsg5\r\n\tMsg4\r\n\tMsg3\r\n\tMsg2\r\n\tMsg1\r\n\t- Msg6 still hidden as well as the duplicate (but newer) Msg1\r\n\r\nThe proposed/tested fix:\r\n- scan the global message list backwards\r\n- build the rendered message list forward (oldest first)\r\n- reverse the list (now with oldest last)\r\n- Splice message array to only include maxMessages\r\n\r\n\r\n\tprivate prepareMessages(): IMessageEntry[] {\r\n\r\n\t\t// Aggregate Messages by text to reduce their count\r\n\t\tconst messages: IMessageEntry[] = [];\r\n\t\tconst handledMessages: { [message: string]: number; } = {};\r\n\r\n\t\tlet offset = 0;\r\n\r\n\t\t// Process messages from oldest to newest\r\n\t\t// Fixes dropping duplicate message\r\n\r\n\t\tfor (let i = this.messages.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\r\n\t\t\tconst message = this.messages[i];\r\n\t\t\tif (types.isUndefinedOrNull(handledMessages[message.text])) {\r\n\t\t\t\tmessage.count = 1;\r\n\t\t\t\tmessages.push(message);\r\n\t\t\t\thandledMessages[message.text] = offset++;\r\n\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\tmessages[handledMessages[message.text]].count++;\r\n\t\t\t\tconsole.debug(messages[handledMessages[message.text]].count);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t// Reverse messages to go from newest to oldest rendering\r\n\t\tmessages.reverse();\r\n\r\n\t\tif (messages.length > this.options.maxMessages) {\r\n\t\t\treturn messages.splice(messages.length - this.options.maxMessages, messages.length);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\treturn messages;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34421","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34421/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34421/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34421/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34421","id":257923178,"number":34421,"title":"Please add the button close Folder and add the Symbol outline ","user":{"login":"quan-tran-niteco","id":12904897,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12904897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quan-tran-niteco","html_url":"https://github.com/quan-tran-niteco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quan-tran-niteco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quan-tran-niteco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quan-tran-niteco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quan-tran-niteco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quan-tran-niteco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quan-tran-niteco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quan-tran-niteco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quan-tran-niteco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quan-tran-niteco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-15T04:16:22Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T07:50:30Z","closed_at":"2017-09-15T07:50:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

data-uri.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34410","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34410/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34410/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34410/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34410","id":257877976,"number":34410,"title":"hexcc","user":{"login":"bluntforcetrauma","id":31938275,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/31938275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluntforcetrauma","html_url":"https://github.com/bluntforcetrauma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluntforcetrauma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluntforcetrauma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluntforcetrauma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluntforcetrauma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluntforcetrauma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluntforcetrauma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluntforcetrauma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluntforcetrauma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluntforcetrauma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":293382067,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/php","name":"php","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-14T22:44:45Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T00:53:06Z","closed_at":"2017-09-15T00:53:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"-
