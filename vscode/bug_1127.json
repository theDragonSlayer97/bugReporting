context-sensitive syntax colorization is very hard to do (if not impossible) with tmLanguage syntax definitions. The functionality for specifying custom colorizers seems to be there, but not exposed to extensions (ITokenizationSupport).\n\nOne way to expose colorization would be to just let the extension provide an ITokenizationSupport implementation, and have that completely override the tmLanguage syntax definition (if any). \n\nAnother way is to let multiple tokenizers work in parallel, each classifying different tokens of the program. For example: A tmLanguage based tokenizer is used to classify easy tokens such as keywords, strings, and literals. A custom tokenizer is used to classify tokens such as identifiers (which generally need context information, think type names). A reason for wanting this is is that classifying tokens such as identifiers is generally much slower than keywords, separating the tokenizers allow for instant colorization on easy tokens to classify, but harder tokens like identifiers are classified in the background and will eventually be colorized, when ready. It might make sense to only allow one tokenizer per language, but allow for multiple (potentially async) token classifiers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1967/reactions","total_count":21,"+1":21,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1966","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1966/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1966/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1966/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1966","id":126296320,"number":1966,"title":"Proposal: Ability not to auto-close comments","user":{"login":"erichiller","id":5379325,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5379325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erichiller","html_url":"https://github.com/erichiller","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erichiller/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erichiller/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erichiller/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erichiller/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erichiller/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erichiller/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erichiller/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erichiller/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erichiller/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":293379998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/languages%20basic","name":"languages basic","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-01-12T22:48:01Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T01:27:16Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"As far as I can tell this is not currently available. \n\nOftentimes I need to comment out blocks of code and use `/**` and immediately a `*/` auto inserted resulting in one extra step.

@bpasero suggested, I'm opening an issue to suggest adding fuzzy search in the palette for commands as well. \n\nHe had an issue with this though, so it could be enabled with a user setting. But I am unsure about his concern.\n\n> The issue with fuzzy matching is that you also need to do fuzzy sorting: more relevant results to the top. However for the command palette we chose to sort entries by name to keep the result list stable and memorable. Enabling fuzzy for commands would change the sort order for each search you do making it harder to learn the list of available commands.\n\nI don't understand how the sort order is relevant when you are looking for a specific command or set of commands. Let's say I would like to look for all Markdown related commands (which start with `Markdown:`): in Sublime, I would only type `md:`, removing practically all unrelevant commands from the results list.

.NET debugging, we have a number of spots where it can be confusing what the line-based text markers used by VS Code are actually pointing at. There are various language features in C# that commonly result either in multiple statements on a single line or in multi-line statements. Some of these such as setting a breakpoint inside of a lambda can be pretty confusing today because the editor markers (current statement, breakpoint bound) just show the line where things are happening instead of the text range. Thus there is no way to tell quite where you are stopped, or where the breakpoint is actually set.\n\nI would suggest supporting both text markers that highlight an entire line, and text markers that highlight a text span ([begin-line,begin-col]->[end-line,end-col]).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1959/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1958","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1958/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1958/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1958/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1958","id":126197834,"number":1958,"title":"Scroll markers should be focusable and snap into position","user":{"login":"tinganho","id":1324476,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1324476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinganho","html_url":"https://github.com/tinganho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinganho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinganho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinganho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinganho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinganho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinganho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinganho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinganho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinganho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":425577013,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-core","name":"editor-core","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-12T14:58:59Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T21:02:25Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I got some problem to scroll into view some error or whatever shown in my scrollbar as markers.

But our enterprise proxy returns \na \n\n```\n  Access Denied (authentication_failed)\n\n  Your credentials could not be authenticated: \"Credentials are missing.\". You will not be permitted    access until your credentials can be verified.\n\n  This is typically caused by an incorrect username and/or password.\n```\n\nMy settings.json looks like this:\n\n```\n// Place your settings in this file to overwrite default and user settings.\n{\n        //-------- HTTP configuration --------\n\n    // The proxy setting to use. If not set will be taken from the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables\n    \"http.proxy\": \"http://myusername:mypassword@123.123.123.123:8080\",\n    \"https.proxy\": \"http://myusername:mypassword@123.123.123.123:8080\",\n\n    // Whether the proxy server certificate should be verified against the list of supplied CAs.\n    \"http.proxyStrictSSL\": false,\n}\n```\n\nThe thing is, i am acutally using the same source of the http.proxy value in my git, npm and bower proxy config. I Also set this up for HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY. Thats where i copy/pasted it from. And well, it just works fine there.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1941","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1941/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1941/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1941/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1941","id":126111065,"number":1941,"title":"Strange

could start it easily from a terminal as a background process in Fedora 23 (using ampersand). However, after an upgrade to 0.10.6 (64bit), it freezes soon after opening. It was not the case in the previous versions.\n\nI suspect it might be related to the git integration somehow. It freezes if a folder is under git source control. It does not freeze otherwise. When I run it with the verbose option, it stops right before prompting for my repository credentials (which it normally does if not frozen).\n\nvscode:\nVersion 0.10.6\nCommit
