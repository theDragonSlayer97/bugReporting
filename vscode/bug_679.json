has a nice behaviour where autocompletion can fall back to a simple string-matching mode that matches terms within the same document, which is extremely useful to reduce typing even though there's no grammar.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this should be available even when the current scope has a grammar, such as Go. For example, one thing I do all the time is write a call to a function before I've defined that function. So I'll do something like:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc main() {\r\n  loadDataFromFile()\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Then I start typing:\r\nfunc loadD\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though there's no function `loadDataFromFile` defined yet, the autocompletion _should_ offer it as a match for `loadD`, because it's in the file. (Having a \"create function loadDataFromFile\" command at the call site would obviously be even better, but this is just one example of many.)\r\n\r\nThis kind of autocompletion is also super useful in purely-plaintext or other non-grammatical scopes, including comments, Markdown, and so on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15411/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15410","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15410/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15410/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15410/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15410","id":188928446,"number":15410,"title":"False errors with SASS maps","user":{"login":"raphievila","id":6283126,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6283126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphievila","html_url":"https://github.com/raphievila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphievila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphievila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphievila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphievila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphievila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphievila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphievila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphievila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphievila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-11-12T19:04:24Z","updated_at":"2016-11-15T04:08:26Z","closed_at":"2016-11-14T09:18:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.7.1 (02611b40b24c9df2726ad8b33f5ef5f67ac30b44, 2016-11-03T13:53:14.822Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\r\n- Extensions:\r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|VisualStudioDarkTheme|Adrien|1.0.1|\r\n|jslint|ajhyndman|1.2.1|\r\n|vscode-color|anseki|0.2.1|\r\n|code-runner|formulahendry|0.4.2|\r\n|composer|ikappas|0.5.0|\r\n|vscode-tfs|ivangabriele|0.5.2|\r\n|vscode-scss|mrmlnc|0.5.0|\r\n|debugger-for-edge|msjsdiag|0.4.1|\r\n|sass-helper|ramyaraoa|0.0.2|\r\n|vscode-icons|robertohuertasm|4.0.1|\r\n|php-formatter|Sophisticode|0.1.3|\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

the issues I discovered after #15174 was merged.\r\n\r\n#15174 added the ability to match relative paths by making the \"root\" path component optional.
