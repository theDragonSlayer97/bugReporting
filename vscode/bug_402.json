I know this is going to sound really silly, but I've wasted 30 mins on this and tried everything and I cannot figure out what's happening.\r\n\r\nI have a VS Code Extension written in TypeScript (Dart Code). I was doing some work on it this morning and everything was working fine - I was make changes, restarting, hitting breakpoints. All good.\r\n\r\nAt some point, the debugger just stopped hitting my breakpoints. It was definitely executing the new code, the breakpoints are listed on the left and highlighted in the editor, but execution does not pause.\r\n\r\nI've tried many things, none of which has solved this, including:\r\n\r\n- Reverting all my code changes to the last commit (when it worked)\r\n- Restarting VS Code (the main IDE, not just extension host)\r\n- Rebooting my PC\r\n- Uninstalling my own extension from Code (though normally I get a warning that it's overwritten so I believe having it installed is a support scenario)\r\n- Make trivial edits to the files to ensure any buffers are flushed\r\n- Run `npm install` to make sure I don't have any mismatched package versions\r\n\r\nI've even put a `console.log` as the first line in `activate` and stuck a breakpoint on it. When I run it, the text appears in the output, yet the breakpoint is not hit:\r\n\r\n![Breakpoint](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1078012/24544675/1c2defee-15fc-11e7-8953-cdfc75eb38ae.png)\r\n\r\nI haven't updated Code (or anything else) in the period between it working/not working; I've literally only modified a few lines of TypeScript in `extension.ts` (other than the troubleshooting listed above).
