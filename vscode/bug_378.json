After 1.11 was released I got a report (andersea/HTMLClassSuggestionsVSCode#9) from a Mac user, that the extension was no longer working. After testing this myself I could confirm that it didn't work on either my Windows PC or my Kubuntu laptop either.\r\n\r\nAfter some debugging, it would seem that the trigger behaviour for calling the completion item provider for html has changed in 1.11 compared to previous versions. If you are inside quotation marks (\"\"), meaning that you are editing an html attribute value, then VS Code no longer triggers code completions.\r\n\r\nYou can trigger the completions manually with ctrl+space, but this is pretty annoying since it did work fine before.\r\n\r\nAs a programmatic workaround, I have found that if you add an array of specific completion characters as trigger characters (so all of a-z) then the completion provider is called. This is not a good workaround however, because it will override the build-in completions completely, so you no longer get completions for normal html, like div, input and table tags or for attributes.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.11.1\r\n- OS Version: All\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install VS Code 1.11\r\n2. Install HTML Class Suggestions extension.\r\n3. Create a new project folder.\r\n4. Add some css (download bootstrap and unpack it into the project.)\r\n5. Create a html file\r\n6. Type (assuming bootstrap) `<div class=\"con`\r\n\r\nIn VS Code 1.10 this triggers the extension to deliver completions from css that starts with \"con\". (You can downgrade to 1.10 to verify this.) This no longer happens in 1.11.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24463","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24463/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24463/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24463/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24463","id":220757345,"number":24463,"title":"Display

longer dispose models when editor inputs change. It looks like 2 of our API tests actually only run green because we had this code, specifically:\r\n* [`issue #20867: vscode.window.visibleTextEditors returns closed document 1/2`](/Users/bpasero/Development/Microsoft/monaco/extensions/vscode-api-tests/src/editor.test.ts)\r\n* [`issue #20867: vscode.window.visibleTextEditors returns closed document 2/2`](/Users/bpasero/Development/Microsoft/monaco/extensions/vscode-api-tests/src/editor.test.ts)\r\n\r\nMy workaround is adding an ugly 800ms [delay](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commit/5ecf0cda9a6c487acc1f0c75a3932954ca9211ef#diff-365a6056bf4fb8d4cd8f2cdc02e58a2bR131).\r\n\r\nWhen I debugged this, I think it boils down to the fact that:\r\n* we open an editor (`withRandomFileEditor`)\r\n* `FileEditorInput` is now using text model references so the ref count is 1 after the editor opens\r\n* `workbench.action.closeAllEditors` is triggered by the test, closing the editor\r\n* previously we would dispose any opened model as a matter of that, but now we only do it when the last reference is disposed\r\n* it looks like we are holding on to two references though, making the test fail when run without the delay\r\n\r\nThe extra reference seems to be coming from [`_handleAsResourceInput`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/ben/input-debt/src/vs/workbench/api/node/mainThreadDocuments.ts#L236). The lifecycle of that reference is not clear to me, it seems to be disposed after a certain timeout.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24456","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24456/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24456/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24456/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24456","id":220712602,"number":24456,"title":"Feature request: Allow creation of nested folders from 'New Folder' button in Explorer","user":{"login":"rhencke","id":178348,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/178348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhencke","html_url":"https://github.com/rhencke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhencke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhencke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhencke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhencke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhencke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhencke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhencke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhencke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhencke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-04-10T17:19:02Z","updated_at":"2017-04-11T13:56:10Z","closed_at":"2017-04-11T08:26:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

load of the window we actually stop any loading when we call into [`process.lazyEnv`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/electron-browser/bootstrap/index.js#L194) and if there is any error during this call, we just get an empty window presented (as reported by many users in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23639).\r\n\r\nThere are multiple problems:\r\n* there is no logging or notification going on when the resolution of the shell environment takes long or fails, making it hard for us to find out about these issues (e.g. the window is just blank and dev tools shows nothing)\r\n* we seem to not resolve any environment on Windows and also not when [`process.env['VSCODE_CLI']`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/code/electron-main/shellEnv.ts#L81) is set so I would expect we can skip this call on the renderer side and save us the inter process communication on startup in those cases\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4984","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"8FA3:366E:743CF0:F4F0A4:59D9382E","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=379>;
