it's not possible to change a SourceControlResourceGroup's label once it's created. From vscode.d.ts:\r\n```\r\nexport interface SourceControlResourceGroup {\r\n\t\treadonly id: string;\r\n\t\treadonly label: string; \r\n                .......\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Perforce, a changelist has a description which can be edited by the user. To refresh that one changelist's description, an extension would have to do `changelist.dispose()` the existing changelist, and call `SourceControl.createResourceGroup()` again with the new description. This has a major side effect, because resource groups are re-arranged in the scm viewlet once an existing one is dispose()'d.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it possible to change a SourceControlResourceGroup's label without having to call `dispose()` and
