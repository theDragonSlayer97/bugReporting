I first tried to install the extension \"C/C++\" from Microsoft. It works great and the performances are good. You don't have to wait when ctrl clicking a symbol to go to the definition.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes when I try to install another language support. I've tried with \"Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat\". As soon as more than 1 extension is installed next to \"c/c++\", the performances become incredibly slow. \r\n\r\nFrom what I could see, the .db file created in the .vscode directoy grows more and more if you install more code parsing plugins. When I install only \"C/c++\", my DB file size is aroung 40MB. If I install Java support, it goes to 80MB and if I add the support for python it goes higher again. \r\n\r\nIt looks that the slowdown is not related to the DB file size, but to the fact that more than 1 language support is enabled. \r\n\r\nFeel free to ask if you need more

Extensions:\r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|material-icon-theme|PKief|1.1.5|\r\n|vscode-docker|PeterJausovec|0.0.10|\r\n|ActiveFileInStatusBar|RoscoP|1.0.2|\r\n|path-intellisense|christian-kohler|1.2.0|\r\n|githistory|donjayamanne|0.1.4|\r\n|python|donjayamanne|0.5.5|\r\n|tslint|eg2|0.7.1|\r\n|relativepathrefactor|jakob101|0.8.0|\r\n|docthis|joelday|0.3.5|\r\n|Angular2|johnpapa|1.0.2|\r\n|goto-last-edit-location|krizzdewizz|0.2.1|\r\n|cpptools|ms-vscode|0.9.3|\r\n|tsimporter|pmneo|1.2.13|\r\n|gitblame|waderyan|1.3.0|\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Type CTRL+² to toggle the terminal as indicated in the shortcuts for a [French keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZERTY#/media/File:KB_France.svg) (notice the ² sign above the TAB key)\r\n2. Nothing happens\r\n3. Add\r\n```\r\n    { \"key\": \"ctrl+'\",                \"command\": \"workbench.action.terminal.toggleTerminal\" }\r\n```\r\nin the keybindings.json\r\n4. The CTRL+² now works properly and toggles the terminal... \r\n5. But CTRL+' (below the 4 key) does not toggle the terminal as one would expect...\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1. looking at the binary form of keybindings.json, the single quote is indeed the expected 0x27\r\n2. my ² key works properly otherwise... (I used it to type in this bug report).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17650","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17650/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17650/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17650/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17650","id":196877594,"number":17650,"title":"[loc][Query][VSCode] Please clarify the string","user":{"login":"mkyjakova","id":18256938,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/18256938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkyjakova","html_url":"https://github.com/mkyjakova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkyjakova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkyjakova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkyjakova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkyjakova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkyjakova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkyjakova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkyjakova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkyjakova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkyjakova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-21T08:53:14Z","updated_at":"2016-12-21T10:19:06Z","closed_at":"2016-12-21T10:19:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, we have a question from our translator.
