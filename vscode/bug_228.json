If I change `b` to be `const` instead of `let` it will work as expected, but I don't want to use const because of `b = saveTestB(b)`.\r\n\r\nBTW. How is this hinting/live linting/autocomplete/whatever system named in VS Code?

Especially for plain text files this makes no sense.\r\n\r\nThis is because you set the default file type for the Windows file save dialog to `*.txt;*.gitignore` which means that everything works fine if I specify a filename ending with either `.txt` or `.gitignore`, but for everything else, `.txt` is appended. This is annoying when creating files like `.env`, `.jshintrc`, `.editorconfig`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, and so on or files where no language exists in VSCode (or is not installed), e.g. `test.csv` or `nginx.conf`. To save such files, one has to use doublequotes, e.g. `\".env\"`.\r\n\r\nI would suggest not setting a file extension in the file save dialog at all for plain text files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28955/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28954","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28954/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28954/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28954/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28954","id":236707887,"number":28954,"title":"the
