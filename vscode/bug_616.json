For new user and old as well, it will be great if there was a better and easier way to display that vscode is doing something in the background and you should wait a bit. And not only that, there are times when it isn't red and I see vscode with 100% process usage and have no idea what is he trying to do. Being red means that there is a problem.\r\n\r\n  2. When i see it red, I click it to get more info.. what i get is select between linux/win/mac ?! I believe that some improvements will be needed for this, cause this is confusing\r\n\r\n  3. It is a bit related to the 1-st point. It would be great if there was a shortcut to Developer Tools->Console . My point is that if the user has a problem, it should have a fast way to find out what it is. The information displayed in the console (log) should be for normal users as well and not only vscode developers. I only found out that you can view this log after 2 months and it would have helped a lot if it was somewhere more obvious/intuitive for normal users.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17300/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17299","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17299/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17299/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17299/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17299","id":195798356,"number":17299,"title":"Difference in debug console output when running and debugging launch configuration","user":{"login":"ChrisBuchholz","id":70427,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/70427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisBuchholz","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisBuchholz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisBuchholz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisBuchholz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisBuchholz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisBuchholz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisBuchholz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisBuchholz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisBuchholz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisBuchholz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisBuchholz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":409283388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/caused-by-extension","name":"caused-by-extension","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-15T12:54:06Z","updated_at":"2016-12-23T15:02:25Z","closed_at":"2016-12-23T15:02:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Version 1.9.0-insider\r\n- OS Version: macOS 10.12.11\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1: Have the following launch configuration set up which start a flask server:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": \"Server\",\r\n            \"type\": \"python\",\r\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n            \"stopOnEntry\": false,\r\n            \"pythonPath\": \"${config.python.pythonPath}\",\r\n            \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/flask/run.py\",\r\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\r\n            \"internalConsoleOptions\": \"openOnSessionStart\",\r\n            \"debugOptions\": [\r\n                \"WaitOnAbnormalExit\",\r\n                \"WaitOnNormalExit\",\r\n                \"RedirectOutput\"\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.

VSCode Version: \r\nVersion 1.8.0\r\nCommit 38746938a4ab94f2f57d9e1309c51fd6fb37553d\r\nDate 2016-12-13T18:03:00.506Z\r\nShell 1.4.6\r\nRenderer 53.0.2785.143\r\nNode 6.5.0\r\n- OS Version: ubuntu 16.04\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. checkout https://github.com/capaj/vscode-exports-autocomplete/tree/vs-code-activation-issue\r\n2. install npm deps with yarn or npm\r\n2. run in debug mode\r\n\r\noutput:\r\n```\r\nActivating extension `capaj.vscode-exports-autocomplete` failed: {1}.\r\nActivating extension `capaj.vscode-exports-autocomplete` failed:  undefined\r\nHere is the error stack:  undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt really isn't that helpful to print out undefined. I realized that my problem is, I am requiring a package `babel-traverse` which is not in node_modules because I did not specify it in package.json. It would be helpful if these kind of errors were properly shown to the user.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17285/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4746","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"DFB7:3670:A857CB:1B25FFC:59D93E3B","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=617>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=615>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"a5a2863482a8dcfb595d25d887ec0464\"","status":"200 OK"}}
