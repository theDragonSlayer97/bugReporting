plan for #8784 \n#### Operating Systems\n- [x] Linux @jrieken\n- [x] Mac @chrmarti\n- [x] Windows @ramya-rao-a\n#### What to Test?\n\nSummary: Ensure variables defined in:\n- launch.json are properly parsed before passing them to the debugger\n- tasks.json are properly parsed before passing them into the task being executed.\n\nVariables such as:\n- ${workspaceRoot}  \n- ${env...} (environment variables)\n- $(config...) ****(settings - note: this is what has been added in the PR #8784)****\n\nOne can now make reference to settings defined in settings.json from within the launch.json and tasks.json file. \n\nFor instance the value \"**${config.editor.fontFamily}**\" defined in launch.json or tasks.json, will be replaced with the actual value **\"Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace\"** when launching the debugger or executing a task (as is done today with ${workspaceRoot}).\n#### Sample Test 1 (Node.js Debugger)\n- Configure the launch.json file as follows:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"node\",\n            \"args\": [\"${workspaceRoot}\", \"${config.editor.fontFamily}\"],\n```\n- When debugging confirm the actual font Family (as defined in settings.json) value is passed into the program\n#### Sample Test 2 (Task)\n- Create a tasks.json file as follows\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"command\": \"echo\",\n    \"isShellCommand\": true,\n    \"args\": [\"Hello World\", \"${workspaceRoot}\", \"${config.editor.fontFamily}\"],\n    \"showOutput\": \"always\"\n}\n```\n- Run the above task and confirm the actual font Family (as defined in settings.json) value is passed into the task\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9559","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9559/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9559/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9559/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9559","id":166722115,"number":9559,"title":"Cannot

The following launch.json file gets created:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": []\n}\n```\n1.

When there is a long running operation on debugger (such as expanding a long array on watch window) the debugger is still holding on to the dll/pdbs. VSCode spawns build tasks, which eventually fails because of file locks and resulting project in a bad state (The files are zero sized on mac, missing dlls on windows etc). \n\ncode: workbench/parts/debug/node/rawDebugSession.ts \nfunction: disconnect\n\nPotential fixes\n1. Wait for infinite amount of time for the debugger to exit. \n2. Provide a different event which can forcefully terminate the debugger on a certain timeout.
