for #19650:\r\ncomplexity: 2\r\n\r\n- [x] Windows - @michelkaporin\r\n- [x] OS X - @sandy081\r\n- [x] Linux - @mousetraps \r\n\r\nIn this milestone we've started to fold the two node debug extensions 'node-debug' and 'node-debug2' into one (conceptual) extension and eliminated the need for dealing with two debug types ('node' and 'node2'). We call it 'conceptual' extension because there are still two extensions, but we try to hide the 'node-debug2' extension so that the user only sees 'node-debug'. The functionality provided by 'node-debug2' is fully available through 'node-debug' (and the associated debug type 'node').\r\n\r\nIn this milestone it works like this:\r\n\r\nThe launch configuration for 'node' supports a new attribute 'protocol' which controls how node-debug uses the old node debugger or the new node debugger.\r\n- **legacy**: node-debug acts like the old node debugger by using the (obsolete) v8 debugger protocol (supported by node versions < v8). In this milestone this is the default if the 'protocol' attribute is missing or if the auto-detection fails.\r\n- **inspector**: node-debug acts like the new node debugger ('node2') by using the inspector protocol (supported by node versions >= 6.3, but not yet supported by electron).\r\n- **auto**: tries to automatically detect the protocol. For configurations of request type 'launch' and if no 'runtimeExecutable' is specified, we try to determine node's version by running node from the PATH with an '--version' argument. If the version is >= 6.9 the new 'inspector' protocol is used. For configurations of request type 'attach' we try to connect with the new protocol and if this works, we use the 'inspector' protocol. We only switch to the new inspector protocol for versions >= 6.9 because of severe problems in earlier versions.\r\n\r\nVerify:\r\n- that the 'protocol' attribute works as described above. Try with two versions of node: one that supports only the old protocol and one that supports the old and the new (a version that only supports the new protocol is not yet available). Try with Electron (which only supports the old protocol even in recent versions).\r\n- that the 'auto' mode works reasonable. We will make this mode the default in the future, so we'll have to make sure that users do not run into lots of issues. \r\n- that if protocol 'auto' is used, a message appears in the debug console that explains how the decision was made.\r\n- the \"Node.js v6.3+ (experimental)\" does not appear in launch config snippets or in the debug environment selector that appears when there is no launch.json.\r\n- the use of debug type 'node2' in launch configs is flagged as deprecated.\r\n\r\nTipps:\r\n- for testing the 'attach' case, launch a node program for the new inspector protocol with `node --inspect` or `node --inspect=5555` or `node --inspect --debug-brk=5555`\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20990","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20990/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20990/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20990/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20990","id":209152136,"number":20990,"title":"_typescript.tryCompleteJsDoc

SublimeText there is a feature to adding folders to project main folder that shown in below image.\r\n![add-forlders-to-project](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10684451/23163943/027a0238-f84a-11e6-8452-b57f01b9816d.PNG)\r\n\r\nThis is a useful feature because I can add Wordpress folder to Wordpress plugin project, so I don't need include Wordpress folder as my main project folder.\r\n\r\nWith this feature Git can detects my main project folder repository.\r\n\r\nCurrently when I add Wordpress as main project folder VS Code can not detects my plugin git repository, so I think that by adding this feature this problem can be solved.\r\n\r\nAlso when I open my plugin folder as main project folder PHP Intellisense extensions can not autocomplete codes of Wordpress because I have not Wordpress folder in my project folder.\r\n\r\nNow I am using `Git Project Manager` extension to opening my plugin folder as git repository, but I think that this feature can be useful than using `Git Project Manager` extension approach.\r\n\r\nRegards.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20986/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20985","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20985/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20985/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20985/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/20985","id":209118297,"number":20985,"title":"Select
