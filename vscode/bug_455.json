VSCode Version: Code 1.10.1 (653f8733dd5a5c43d66d7168b4701f94d72b62e5, 2017-03-02T00:47:58.633Z)\r\n- OS Version: Linux x64 4.4.0-64-generic\r\n- Extensions: not relevant\r\n\r\n---\r\nMy team and I use Artifactory to cache locally the .deb files rather than downloading from the Internet over and over again.\r\n\r\nThe consequence is that a dev's box has a single sources.list file holding all the entries reading from the site-local cache rather than from the Internet.\r\n\r\nThis eventually leads to following error when installing VS Code:\r\n```\r\n$ sudo apt-get install code\r\n...\r\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/code.postinst: line 66: /etc/apt//sources.list.d/vscode.list: No such file or directory\r\ndpkg: error processing package code (--configure):\r\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\r\nErrors were encountered while processing:\r\n code\r\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Configure the GPG key and APT repository manually (inspired by https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_installation but using other files / folders to suite needs of site-local cache)\r\n2. run `sudo apt-get install code`\r\n3. the script /var/lib/dpkg/info/code.postinst fails as shown above\r\n\r\n==> this script seems to silently try to add the repo to the sources list of the user.\r\n\r\n**This is not the Ubuntu / Debian usual way**\r\n\r\nThis may be a good idea for the .deb downloaded from the web site directly, but it should *not* be run when the user has already configured his system to grab VS Code from a repo (Microsoft's or another) somewhere.\r\n\r\nHow can you know if the repo is already configured?\r\nYou may run `apt-cache madison code` to check if VS Code can be found and where.\r\n\r\nThe key is that the user should not be forced to have the GPG key and the apt source configured as you expect, because some of them will simply have different requirements.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22144","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22144/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22144/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22144/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22144","id":212417446,"number":22144,"title":"Format
