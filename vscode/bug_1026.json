VSCode Version: 0.10.11, 0.10.13-insider, 0.10.14-insider\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n- TypeScript Version: 1.8.9 locally via tsdk workspace, also occurs with this setting removed.\n- Node Version: 4.1.1\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1) String literal declaration as follows (You can also download the source [here](https://github.com/ibgib/bibleGib)):\n\n```\n/** String literal with possible values. Used in place of an enum to allow string type. */\nexport type RequestType = 'LaunchRequest' | 'IntentRequest' | 'SessionEndedRequest';\nexport const RequestType = {\n    LaunchRequest: 'LaunchRequest' as RequestType,\n    IntentRequest: 'IntentRequest' as RequestType,\n    SessionEndedRequest: 'SessionEndedRequest' as RequestType\n};\n```\n\n2) Build the project (ctrl+shift+B) **with the file closed, i.e. not in the edit window**. In my project, I have created a task as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    // See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\n    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"command\": \"tsc\",\n    \"isShellCommand\": true,\n    \"args\": [\"-p\", \".\"],\n    \"showOutput\": \"silent\",\n    \"problemMatcher\": \"$tsc\"\n}\n```\n\n3) The compiler shows that there are multiple errors (for each of the above string literal declarations). When you navigate to the error (thus opening the file in a window), however, the error message disappears. If you compile with the offending file already open (in my case, either helper.ts or alexa-skills-kit.ts), the compiler error does not show at all.\n\nBecause it not showing up with the file open in a window, I would think that there is something funky going on with caching and the string literal feature. Possibly a TypeScript issue and not a VS code issue?

There is a lot of legacy code that still uses
