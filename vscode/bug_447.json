seems like VS Code has some kind of update each time I run it, which is great. However, the big notifications break my workflow. I would love it if the notifications could get out of my way.\r\n\r\n- For me the notification has no use. I always click the button 'Later' and the update gets installed silently when I close/reopen at some time. It is a text editor, not a banking app that needs the latest security patch.\r\n\r\n- The notification is rather big, so (for me) hard to ignore. Even if I could resist it I am forced to do it because it covers the tabs in the editor.\r\n\r\n- If there are release notes, then I want to read those when it suits me. I don't want to interrupt something I'm working on to check the release notes and then figure out what I was supposed to be doing.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like is there to be some kind of small unobtrusive notification (like the flag in regular Visual Studio) that would tell me that there is an update. It could also link to the release notes (after an update) so that I can leave it flagged until I have time to check out the new features. Or just have an option to turn off all notifications related to updates, and always install them silently.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22386","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22386/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22386/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22386/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22386","id":213321444,"number":22386,"title":"Feature Request - Add \"Copy Relative Path\" to Explorer","user":{"login":"henryJack","id":22593502,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/22593502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryJack","html_url":"https://github.com/henryJack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryJack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryJack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryJack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryJack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryJack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryJack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryJack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryJack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryJack/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-03-10T11:51:38Z","updated_at":"2017-03-10T19:37:29Z","closed_at":"2017-03-10T19:37:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.10\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nAdding the correct relative path for import statements takes time.

CC @chrisdias \r\n\r\nhttp://mern.io/ defines a starter kit for MERN. I was looking with @weinand into the best VS Code debugger setup.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to use an NPM launch configuration so that the vscode independent launching details can be defined inside the `package.son` and do not have to be defined inside the vscode specific launch configuration.\r\n\r\nI've added the following script to the starter kit's `package.json` in the `scripts` section:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"start:debug\": \"cross-env BABEL_DISABLE_CACHE=1 NODE_ENV=development nodemon --nolazy --inspect=5858 index.js\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the following launch configuration we could launch and debug the target from VS Code. \r\n\r\nThe script sets `restart` to true since the starterkit is using nodemon and we want to reattach when nodemon restarts the target program.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": \"Launch via NPM\",\r\n            \"type\": \"node\",\r\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n            \"protocol\": \"inspector\",\r\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\r\n            \"runtimeExecutable\": \"npm\",\r\n            \"windows\": {\r\n                \"runtimeExecutable\": \"npm.cmd\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"runtimeArgs\": [\r\n                \"run-script\",\r\n                \"start:debug\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"timeout\": 20000,\r\n            \"restart\": true,\r\n            \"port\": 5858\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe've ran into the following glitches:\r\n- using the inspector protocol worked but we did not see all the console output (e.g. the webpack built time) in the DebugConsole.\r\n- when using the `legacy` protocol and the `--debug` option you get a timeout error.\r\n- with the working setup above you need to use the task manager to kill the target program. We tried to configure the launch configuration to use the internal terminal so that we can kill the target from the terminal. When using the internal terminal then the launching failed.

when I am at work.\r\nIn this alias, I have this simple function:\r\n\r\n``` shell\r\necho \"Opening $# apps...\"\r\nfor appBundleIdentifier in \"$@\"\r\ndo\r\n  $(open -b $appBundleIdentifier)\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `appBundleIdentifier` holds things like `com.apple.mail`, `com.fournova.Tower2`, but also `com.microsoft.VSCode`, which is the Bundle Identifier of Microsoft VS Code.\r\nWhen I open up VSCode, I have the following message:\r\n\r\n> Code needs to change the 'code' shell command. Would you like to do this now ?\r\n\r\nthen\r\n\r\n> Please remove the alias referencing 'com.microsoft.VSCode' in '/MyUser/.zshrc' (line xxx) and retry this action.\r\n\r\nthen \r\n\r\n> Please remove the 'code' alias from '/MyUser/.zshrc' before continuing.\r\n\r\nThe thing is I don't have any `code` alias present there. I guess it takes the `com.microsoft.VSCode` as the code alias and thinks it would break the code shell command (which works perfectly btw).\r\n\r\nIt would be better to dismiss this message and/or disable the check of `code` in the shell ressource file in the VSCode settings.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Put the VSCode Bundle Identifier on your .bashrc (or .zshrc or any other shell ressource), for example: `echo 'com.microsoft.VSCode'`. Note that it won't work if you put it in comments.\r\n2. Open up VSCode.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22365","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22365/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22365/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22365/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22365","id":213290704,"number":22365,"title":"command
