Run chokidar file watcher to monitor all file changes in current directory (use this [repro](https://github.com/laggingreflex/chokidar-vscode-test))\r\n2. Have a `.gitignore` file\r\n3. Open VSCode in current dir\r\n4. Make changes to any file, other than `.gitignore`\r\n5. chokidar randomly logs file changes for `.gitignore` file\r\n\r\nPS: It's not related to `chokidar` as I've tried with other editors and VSCode is the only one that this happens in.
