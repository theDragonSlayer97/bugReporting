However, for an editor that accentuates support for JavaScript, the syntax highlighting is less than sub-par. \n\nTo illustrate, here's VS Code and Sublime using the same color scheme:\n![vsc_](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11352152/14573672/6ef0d336-0324-11e6-8b8a-6953b87cb469.PNG)\n![subl3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11352152/14573673/6ef1c106-0324-11e6-8a62-d2f3fdc460f4.PNG)\n\nThe

Type \"typeof\" in a JavaScript file. \n\nSeems to always pop up when while I'm typing an if statement and haven't added the variable I'm trying to get the typeof. Not a huge issue but results in a VSCode error popping up that I then have to close.\n\nDeveloper tools shows: \n\n```\n    Cannot read property 'identifier' of undefined\n    e.doShow @ workbench.main.js:90\n```\n\nGreat work on VSCode though!
