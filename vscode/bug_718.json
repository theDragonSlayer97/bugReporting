In each file we have to use a reference to our custom typings eg. `../../../typings/index.d.ts`.

VSCode Version: 1.6.1\n- OS Version: Windows 10 1607 (14393.321)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nI can't give you a repro until we update the PowerShell extension and release it.  But I can describe what is going on.  I open a file with lots of functions in it.  I want to see the list of symbols so I press `Ctrl+Shift+O`.  I see this VSCode/extension exchange in our log:\n\n```\n    READ MESSAGE:\n\n    {\n      \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n      \"id\": 4,\n      \"method\": \"textDocument/documentSymbol\",\n      \"params\": {\n        \"uri\": \"file:///c%3A/Users/Keith/GitHub/PowerShell/Plaster/src/InvokePlaster.ps1\"\n      }\n    }\n\n    WRITE MESSAGE:\n\n    {\n      \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n      \"id\": \"4\",\n      \"result\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"AreFilesIdentical { }\",\n          \"kind\": 12,\n          \"location\": {\n            \"uri\": \"c:/Users/Keith/GitHub/PowerShell/Plaster/src/InvokePlaster.ps1\",\n            \"range\": {\n              \"start\": {\n                \"line\": 647,\n                \"character\": 8\n              },\n              \"end\": {\n                \"line\": 659,\n                \"character\": 9\n              }\n            }\n          },\n          \"containerName\": \"InvokePlaster\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"ColorForOperation { }\",\n          \"kind\": 12,\n          \"location\": {\n            \"uri\": \"c:/Users/Keith/GitHub/PowerShell/Plaster/src/InvokePlaster.ps1\",\n            \"range\": {\n              \"start\": {\n                \"line\": 1228,\n                \"character\": 0\n              },\n              \"end\": {\n                \"line\": 1240,\n                \"character\": 1\n              }\n            }\n          },\n          \"containerName\": \"InvokePlaster\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"ConvertToDestinationRelativePath { }\",\n          \"kind\": 12,\n          \"location\": {\n            \"uri\": \"c:/Users/Keith/GitHub/PowerShell/Plaster/src/InvokePlaster.ps1\",\n            \"range\": {\n              \"start\": {\n                \"line\": 1179,\n                \"character\": 0\n              },\n              \"end\": {\n                \"line\": 1191,\n                \"character\": 1\n              }\n            }\n          },\n          \"containerName\": \"InvokePlaster\"\n        },\n```\n\nNote that I have updated the PowerShell extension to return Symbols in sorted order (by name).  Yet this is what VSCode shows in the UI:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5177512/19630545/e76fd3a0-9949-11e6-986c-40d81ab31e9a.png)\n\nIt appears to me that VSCode is trying to preserve the symbol order based on the position of the symbol in the file.  VSCode should really honor the order returned by the extension.  For instance, when I'm searching for a particular function, I couldn't give a flying flip about the relative position of the symbol in the file.  As we learned in Algorithms 101, searching a **SORTED** list is a helluva lot quicker than an unsorted list.  :-)\n\nPlease provide a way for symbols to be displayed in the order the extension supplies them to VSCode.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14239","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14239/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14239/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14239/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14239","id":184720999,"number":14239,"title":"Property 'moduleName' is missing in type.","user":{"login":"sverrirs","id":1184355,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1184355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sverrirs","html_url":"https://github.com/sverrirs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sverrirs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sverrirs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sverrirs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sverrirs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sverrirs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sverrirs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sverrirs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sverrirs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sverrirs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-10-23T22:37:51Z","updated_at":"2016-10-24T09:01:17Z","closed_at":"2016-10-24T08:33:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: master branch\n- OS Version: Win7\n\nHi,\n\nI checked out the master branch code and am playing around with the code. \n\nHowever I keep running into this same error for every class I create and add to the project when I try to use the IInstantiationService to create an instance of it.\n\nThe error is always the same but MY_TYPE is different and the X-number of the AsyncDescriptorX class (depending on the number of constructor arguments needed).\n\n```\nError: Argument of type 'typeof MY_TYPE' is not assignable to parameter of type 'AsyncDescriptor0<>'.

VSCode Version: 1.6.1\n- OS Version: Linux\n\nTime for a really petty bug report. Ready?\n\nThere are several locations where VS Code uses \"it is recommended\" without any context, and it just feels wrong. Specific examples:\n- \"It is recommended to keep the commit's first line under 50 characters\" when typing a commit message > 50 char. **What** is recommending that? This could be reworded as:\n  - \"The Git style guide recommends the first line is under 50 characters.\"\n- \"It is recommended to install the 'someone.something' extension\" when opening certain filetypes. **What** is recommending this and **why**? Plenty of replacements here; off the top of my head:\n  - \"You may want to install '{extension}' to edit this type of file.\"\n  - \"The extension '{extension}' may be useful in your project.\" -- still kind of vague, but removes the \"it\" that doesn't refer to anything\n  - \"This filetype can be handled by the '{extension}' extension in the Marketplace.\"\n\nYou can see more [in a
