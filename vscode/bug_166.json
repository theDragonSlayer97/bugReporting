I'd like to make it easy for users to add those to their settings using snippets.\r\n\r\nIdeally I would like users to be able to start typing \"powermode\" in settings.json and have a snippet suggestion show up that would complete to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"powermode.enabled\": true,\r\n\"powermode.enableShake\": false\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the only way I've been able to do this is to create a \"powermode\" entry in my configuration like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"powermode\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"object\",\r\n    \"defaultSnippets\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"label\": \"No shake\",\r\n            \"body\": {\r\n                \"enabled\": true,\r\n                \"enableShake\": false\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with this, though, is that the convention is to define settings in a single level, i.e. as \"powermode.enabled\" and \"powermode.enableShake\". I can go against this and define all my settings as properties on \"powermode\", but I'd rather not.\r\n\r\nBut there is one more reason why snippets in the root level are useful: It would allow people to contribute snippets that set settings across multiple extensions/built in settings.\r\n\r\nIn my case, \"combos\" in powermode rely on having the status bar visible, so adding `\"workbench.statusBar.visible\": true` might make sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30833","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30833/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30833/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30833/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30833","id":243309626,"number":30833,"title":"Update

like to ask about feature that came recently to my mind.\r\nLet's say that we have Vagrant or just plain VM.\r\nLet's say we use Rust or similiar programming language where we have appropriate extensions for VSCode, but they require some time and knowledge to setup (Rust Language Server etc.).\r\nLet's say that we have beginner programmers that may use Windows, Linux or Mac and it's cumbersome for them to setup development environment themselves, so it should be possible to just download code, run prepared Vagrant VM and have everything up and running.\r\n\r\nNow, it would be nice if this virtual machine had some \"Visual Studio Code Server\" (and that's my requested feature), so we would have Visual Studio Code on our host machine that can connect to this server on VM (ssh?), use server's configuration, plugins and allow to browse file, folders, execute commands provided by extensions, use terminal, remotely.\r\n\r\nI can see huge value in this feature, because it would allow to provide seamless, friendly experience, even for most complicated projects.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4386","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"CE43:366F:C3D427:17DCD7A:59D933FB","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=167>;
