VSCode Version: 0.10.11\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nI encountered some odd behaviors in VSCode, when using tasks and the output window.\nI'm currently doing some Python and has setup a task, for ease of execution using\n<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>.\n\n---\n\nThe main issue is that VSCode opens the output window when the task starts (given that `\"showOutput\": \"always\"` is true), but output is first appearing when the task has ended.\n\nThe following text first appears in the output window 10 seconds after the task is started (i.e. when the task is done).\n\n```\nfrom time import sleep\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n    sleep(1) # seconds\n```\n\n---\n\nWhat makes this further confusing it that the following never prints anything (as expected, due to the above).\n\n```\nfrom time import sleep\n\nwhile True:\n    print(\"Freeze\")\n    sleep(1) # seconds\n```\n\nBut change the delay to 10 milliseconds and suddenly the output window is filled with \"Freeze\" every 4-10 seconds.\n\n```\nfrom time import sleep\n\nwhile True:\n    print(\"Freeze\")\n    sleep(0.01) # seconds\n```\n\nI changed the delay to 100 milliseconds instead of 10 milliseconds, and \"Freeze\" first appeared after 2-3 minutes in the output window.\n\n---\n\nAlso removing the sleep command entirely, ends up in VSCode freezing completely.\n\nSomething interesting in this case, is that \"Freeze\" appears once. Then after 10-20 seconds, the output window is then again filled with \"Freeze\", while VSCode is still totally frozen. While the only solution being to kill VSCode with the task manager.\n\n```\nwhile True:\n    print(\"Freeze\")\n```\n\n---\n\nAlso something that is worth mentioning. As (obviously) it's an output window, and not an input window. When the running task tries to read from the standard input (`raw_input()`/`input()` in Python) the task just stops.\n\nAs a feature request it would be nice to have an input/output window, instead of just an output window. If not, then just at least some prompt for closing the running task, instead of just having it frozen and hidden away in the background, not knowing what is happening.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4448","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4448/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4448/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4448/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4448","id":142025480,"number":4448,"title":"Why open Unity3d project aways 300%+ cpu usage?","user":{"login":"fishg","id":1423545,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1423545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg","html_url":"https://github.com/fishg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-19T04:22:56Z","updated_at":"2016-03-21T08:24:43Z","closed_at":"2016-03-21T08:24:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 0.10.11\n- OS Version:OS X 10.11.3\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. use vscode open a c# solution which created by Unity3D\n2. open some c# file in vscode\n   Your will see cpu usage is more than 300% when first load,it's expect.

Enterprise Version 6.1.7601\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Start VSCode.\n2. Press Control + a few times because you're getting older and your monitor is very large. :)\n3. Right click on some text. \n\nExpected result: The context menu opens at the mouse pointer. \n\nActual result: The context menu opens at what would be the right location if you hadn't increased the font size. \n\nNotes: \n1. I could not for the life of me find a way to search these issues, apologies in advance if this is a dupe. \n2. This is a new bug for this update - this didn't used to happen.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4436","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4436/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4436/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4436/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4436","id":141955193,"number":4436,"title":"html
