I submitted a new issue because I can't re-open that issue.  \r\nAll functions ran OK after I compiled and installed vscode with [conda](https://anaconda.org/), except the error `The mode has failed while tokenizing the input.` popped up every time I opened a file or typed a character. Meanwhile, the syntax can't be highlighted.

Bug:\r\n\r\nnpm.bat will fail on Windows if the vscode code tree/repository is in a subdirectory\r\nwith any directories with spaces in the path.  The error does not fatally\r\nstop the script making it easy to miss the \"cannot open\" output from\r\nthe npm script.  The error also does not show up in the npm_debug.txt\r\nfile after many modules have been processed.\r\n\r\nThe bug is in line five, in the findstr command -\r\n\r\n5 for /f \"tokens=2 delims=:, \" %%a in ('findstr /R /C:\"\\\"electronVersion\\\":.*\" %~dp0..\\package.json') do set npm_config_target=%%~a\r\n\r\nThe file string:   %~dp0..\\package.json\r\n\r\nWill to evaluate to multiple files/folders for any path with spaces and folder names.\r\nThus %electronVersion does not get set but no fatal error stops the script.\r\nSince the command output gets overrun from the npm output it's easy to miss the warning.\r\nThe actual error building electron comes much later and gives no clue as to the cause\r\n(empty electronVersion value)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n(working example) CheckOut code to:  C:\\Dev\\vscode\r\n\r\n(failure example) CheckOut code to:  C:\\VSC Dev\\vscode\r\n(Initial output to terminal NOT npm_debug_out)\r\nFINDSTR: Cannot open C:\\VSC\r\nFINDSTR: Cannot open Dev\\vscode\\scripts\\..\\package.json\r\n...subsequent npm output until electron failure\r\n\r\nThe Fix: Simply enclose the full file path string in double quotes\r\n\r\n5 for /f \"tokens=2 delims=:, \" %%a in ('findstr /R /C:\"\\\"electronVersion\\\":.*\" \"%~dp0..\\package.json\"') do set npm_config_target=%%~a\r\n\r\nI also added an error level output so code.bat could detect an error.\r\nAdditionally command output with an explicit fatal error.\r\n\r\nCan I submit these fixes?  I am embarrassed, but it took me three days\r\nto catch this as all other similar issues I read on github pointed\r\nto a toolchain issue. There our problems with the C++ tools install\r\nthat can lead you down a wrong path. I would like to add some notes\r\nto the contribution wiki page.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to contributing especially for accessibility\r\nas a disabled\\ALS user using voice programming - I really love\r\nthe vscode editor !\r\n\r\nCheers

Stop the vs code react native debugger by hitting the red box stop button\r\n4. Keep the window open\r\n4. Run `react-native run-ios` from a terminal. Normally this would spawn another terminal.

Go to View -> Toggle Word Wrap\r\n2. Hit Alt-z\r\n\r\nText remains wrapped no regardless of attempts to toggle word wrapping. Have also tried the following settings:\r\n\r\n\"editor.wordWrap\": \"on\"\r\n\"editor.wordWrap\": \"off\"\r\n\r\nWhich did nothing.\r\n\r\nThis used to work in 1.8. The behaviour changed in 1.9 and early versions of 1.10 and I could 'toggle' word wrapping by manually changing these settings:\r\n\r\n\"editor.wordWrap\": true,\r\n\"editor.wrappingColumn\": -1\r\n\r\nBut trying either Alt-z or going to View -> Toggle Word Wrap had no effect.\r\n\r\nWith the latest version of 1.10 I can no longer toggle word wrapping - no matter what I try the text remains wrapped.\r\n\r\nContrary to claims made in previous reports of this problem #21291 and #21487 something HAS changed since 1.8 as toggling word wrap used to work perfectly, it then went to having to be changed by going to File -> Preferences -> Settings and manually changing the settings to now where the settings cannot be changed at all.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21551","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21551/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21551/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21551/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21551","id":210745639,"number":21551,"title":"'Open recent' list should be longer","user":{"login":"boris-ilijic","id":1659646,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1659646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-ilijic","html_url":"https://github.com/boris-ilijic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-ilijic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-ilijic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-ilijic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-ilijic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-ilijic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-ilijic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-ilijic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-ilijic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-ilijic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":421131022,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/as-designed","name":"as-designed","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-02-28T10:26:12Z","updated_at":"2017-02-28T12:29:30Z","closed_at":"2017-02-28T11:49:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.9.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
