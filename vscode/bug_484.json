The problem\r\n\r\nThere are two important settings in VS Code that control line wrapping.\r\n\r\n* `editor.wrappingColumn` (300 by default)\r\n* and `editor.wordWrap` (false by default)\r\n\r\nExamples (with explanations):\r\n\r\n| `wordWrap` | `wrappingColumn` | Behaviour |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| false | N > 0 | Lines will wrap at <code>N</code> |\r\n| false | 0 | Lines will wrap at <code>viewport_column</code> |\r\n| false | -1 | Lines will never wrap. |\r\n| true | N > 0 | Lines will wrap at <code>min(viewport_column, N)</code> |\r\n| true | 0 | Lines will wrap at <code>viewport_column</code> |\r\n| true | -1 | Lines will never wrap. |\r\n\r\nThe fact that `wrappingColumn` is the primary setting and that we wrap at <code>300</code> by default is causing a lot of pain.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Toggle Word Wrap action toggles `wordWrap: false | true` in user settings. But if `wrappingColumn` is also configured, the action becomes a no-op.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The proposal\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to focus on the most important use-cases and to make `wordWrap` the **primary** setting.\r\n\r\nTo prevent unexpected behaviours for folks already using `wrappingColumn`, it will be completely ignored (deprecated) and a new setting `editor.wordWrapColumn` will take part of its attributes:\r\n\r\n| `editor.wordWrap` | Behaviour |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| \"off\" | Lines will never wrap. |\r\n| \"on\" | Lines will wrap at viewport |\r\n| \"wordWrapColumn\" | Lines will wrap at <b><code>editor.wordWrapColumn</code></b> |\r\n| \"bounded\" | Lines will wrap at <code>min(</code>viewport, <b><code>editor.wordWrapColumn)</code></b> |\r\n\r\nThe defaults **change to** => `wordWrap: \"off\"`, `wordWrapColumn: 80`\r\n\r\nThe Toggle Word Wrap action should toggle `wordWrap: \"on\" | \"off\"` in user settings. There is a separate issue #20675, tracking that the Toggle Word Wrap should not persist to user settings or do so in a per-buffer way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21262/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21261","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21261/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21261/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21261/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21261","id":209709414,"number":21261,"title":"smartStep/SkipFiles and stopOnEntry=true should stop at first actual source line mapped","user":{"login":"mmc41","id":17993,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/17993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmc41","html_url":"https://github.com/mmc41","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmc41/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmc41/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmc41/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmc41/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmc41/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmc41/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmc41/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmc41/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmc41/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-02-23T09:38:08Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T09:40:38Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
