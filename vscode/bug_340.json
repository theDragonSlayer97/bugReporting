Files (x86)\\Microsoft VS Code Insiders\\code - insiders.exe\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only error recorded in the windows event logs was an `Application popup` log entry in the `System` logs. It simply contained a copy of the message - no further information.\r\nAre there logs recorded anywhere that I can post for assistance?\r\n\r\nI've searched everywhere and the only references I can find relate to multiple ComCtl32.dll versions in windows xp. (e.g.: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37016803/calling-taskdialogindirect-loader-says-ordinal-345-not-found)\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.12.0.insider (2017-04-27T06:12:15.095Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro v10.0.14393\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Launch `Code - insiders.exe` <- throws error.\r\n2. Launch `Code - insiders.exe` a second time <- runs ok.\r\n\r\nRepeat this process over and over with same result every second time.\r\n\r\n![2017-04-28](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/355130/25504562/ac4e99de-2be1-11e7-81dc-f7789a0e9aaa.png)\r\n\r\n![2017-04-28 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/355130/25504568/b277e040-2be1-11e7-8abe-afabc892064c.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4212","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"84FE:366E:73E8F2:F43A08:59D9371D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=341>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=339>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"27322210dbb4a241c42f5eeb3430fda7\"","status":"200 OK"}}
