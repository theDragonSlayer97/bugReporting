to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. open a workspace with one folder that contains another folder \"qunit\" with some files\r\n2. F1 > Clear Editor History\r\n3. open some files from the qunit folder to add them to quick open history\r\n4. Open settings and define a files.exclude like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"files.exclude\": {\r\n    \"**/.git\": true,\r\n    \"**/.svn\": true,\r\n    \"**/.hg\": true,\r\n    \"**/CVS\": true,\r\n    \"**/.DS_Store\": true,\r\n    \"**/qunit/**\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n=> the qunit folder should now hide from the explorer\r\n=> bring up quick open and notice the file from qunit still showing up\r\n\r\nThis is unexpected, I have code that listens to changes to the `files.exclude` pattern and remove entries that no longer match. When I debug this I end up in this location right before I enter `ParsedExpression` here: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/services/history/browser/history.ts#L428\r\n\r\nThe pattern does not match, but I verified that the setting is the one as defined.

Assigning to you in the hope that you have better ways of doing so. I think what we need is a way to log exactly how the matching happens within glob.
