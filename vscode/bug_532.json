When the cursor is positioned above it, a hint is shown:\r\n\r\n![clipboard02](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8589488/22590358/7ae6341c-ea17-11e6-854c-60d6f5608dd7.png)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the hint is large and is positioned over the area I'm currently editing. Usually I'm concentrated on editing and don't really realize why that happened so I just press the `Esc` key to get rid of it. However, even if I do that, but then I move the cursor again just a bit (sometimes unintentionally), the hint returns, and that becomes annoying at times.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to always position the hint box so it doesn't overlay some rectangle within the cursor's area. The logic is quite simple, in essence:\r\n\r\n* If the caret is above the cursor, open the hint to the bottom.\r\n* If the caret is below, open the hint to the top.\r\n* If the caret is to the left, open the hint to the right.\r\n* If the caret is to the right, open the hint to the left.\r\n\r\nOf course this only matters if the caret is anywhere close to the cursor and the hint box is large enough to reach it, and there can be many potential adjustments and tweaks for various cases. I'm just giving this as an example.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19831","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19831/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19831/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19831/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19831","id":205139193,"number":19831,"title":"window.menuBarVisibility bug","user":{"login":"anil-karatas","id":6079113,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6079113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anil-karatas","html_url":"https://github.com/anil-karatas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anil-karatas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anil-karatas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anil-karatas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anil-karatas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anil-karatas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anil-karatas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anil-karatas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anil-karatas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anil-karatas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-03T11:56:17Z","updated_at":"2017-02-03T17:48:15Z","closed_at":"2017-02-03T17:48:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n- VSCode Version:\r\nVersion 1.9.0\r\nCommit 27240e71ef390bf2d66307e677c2a333cebf75af\r\nDate 2017-02-02T08:21:13.228Z\r\nShell 1.4.6\r\nRenderer 53.0.2785.143\r\nNode 6.5.0\r\n\r\n- OS Version:\r\nLinux 4.8.17-1-MANJARO\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

menu:\r\n\r\n![2017-02-03_10-32-15](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1898161/22586552/b041a52a-e9fd-11e6-9949-e0b2576850cb.png)\r\n\r\nI fully understand why we do this, but I think the use of QuickPick in this situation is confusing (and I even have proof for this from user studies done by @stevencl in debug land).\r\n\r\nThe problem with QuickPick is that it is normally used when the user explicitly triggered an action with multiple choices: the QuickPick menu does not come as a surprise in these cases.\r\n\r\nBut in the situation at hand the user has requested VS Code to open a specific workspace and does not expect a QuickPick to appear. And from past experience he has learned, that there is no QuickPick when opening a workspace.\r\n\r\nEven I am still surprised by the QuickPick in this case and quickly press Esc to make it go away because I suspect that I've accidentally triggered some action. \r\n\r\nWe have seen the same in the debug user studies: when users started debugging for the first time by pressing F5 they have no launch.json and a QuickPick menu appears offering different debug environment choices. Since users are not expecting this, they dismiss the menu quickly and debugging will fail. They are not realising that an important decision needs to be made here.\r\n\r\nCould we try to introduce a different UI for situations like this? Something like an modal \"alert/confirmation style\" QuickPick?\r\n\r\n/cc @stevencl

Install the [Blade Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yukidoi.blade-runner) extension (an extension that starts a build task whenever a workspace is opened).\r\n2. Set up a build task for the workspace.\r\n3. Make sure `showOutput` is set to `never` in `tasks.json`.\r\n4. Open the workspace.\r\n\r\nIn 1.8 everything worked as expected, the `output` panel didn't show up when `showOutput` was set to `never` or `silent` (and the task had a matcher). In 1.9 this doesn't seem to work anymore. So the output panel now pops up every time the project is opened (which is a bit annoying).\r\n\r\nThe source code used by the extension is:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport * as vscode from 'vscode'; \r\n\r\nexport function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {\r\n\tvscode.commands.executeCommand(\"workbench.action.tasks.build\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a change in the API that needs to be addressed? or is this a bug?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19810/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19809","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19809/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19809/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19809/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19809","id":205105802,"number":19809,"title":"Cannot refactor - File not found","user":{"login":"tSte","id":8778539,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8778539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte","html_url":"https://github.com/tSte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tSte/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-02-03T09:14:47Z","updated_at":"2017-02-03T12:52:39Z","closed_at":"2017-02-03T12:52:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have a refactor issue after last update.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version:\r\n1.9.0\r\n- OS Version:\r\nWindows 8.1 Pro x64\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
