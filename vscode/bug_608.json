bootstrap buttons, there are almost 6 types. If we need to support templates for bootstrap button, we need to add either 6 templates/a single template with the template variable class's default value as\r\n\r\n`\r\n<button class=\"btn btn-${1:default|primary|secondary|info|warning|danger}\">$2</button>\r\n`\r\n\r\nWhile selecting this template, the user needs to delete the complete selection & type the required choice/selectively delete portions of this default value.\r\n\r\nInstead, if snippets consider any value with pipe`|` separators to be choice & display a dropdown, then the user just need to use his up & down arrows in the keyboard/mouse click to select the actual choice.\r\n\r\nThis will improve the user experience for expanding templates significantly & improve developer

thinking about picking up #12628, but would like to get some input from the UX team, so we can get the design right.\r\n\r\n## Current State\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/20053382/88475732-a4d8-11e6-97aa-80eb257c5264.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, this design doesn't work when activitybar is hidden or in the right.\r\n\r\n## Electron's limitation\r\n\r\nElectron allows one of the four following styles, but they can't be changed at runtime. Would need a restart of VSCode to use another style.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4033249/21313907/4580a386-c62f-11e6-9984-a08284442a28.png)\r\n\r\n## Points of Discussion\r\n\r\n### To make the inline traffic lights work, there are three options:\r\n\r\n1. When inlining traffic lights into activitybar, lock activitybar so user can't hide it or move it to the right.\r\n\r\n2. Tweak the sidebar and tabbar, so they could contain the traffic lights. Chrome-style tabbar is achievable:\r\n\r\n    ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/900690/19407942/0deedfac-92b1-11e6-9a5c-ae38a3a3b28b.png)\r\n\r\n    **but I can't find a good way to let sidebar contain traffic lights**. Haven't seen other OS X app putting traffic light in sidebar either.\r\n\r\n3. Instead of inlining traffic lights into activitybar, we inline the traffic lights into a **custom titlebar**. This is how many macOS apps are designed, like Mail, iTunes and Safari:\r\n\r\n    ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4033249/21311564/c7c6dc32-c622-11e6-83f5-8f4188b85805.png)\r\n\r\n1 is easy to implement. 3 feels right design-wise. 2 probably isn't worth pursuing, as it involves a lot effort for a not-so-good design.\r\n\r\n### Do we also add such a feature for Windows?\r\n\r\n- If so, I think inlining traffic lights into custom titlebar is better, as the \"traffic lights\" are to the right in Windows. Borrowing @be5invis's mockups...\r\n\r\n    This looks natural:\r\n\r\n    ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4033249/21310986/f094e698-c61f-11e6-978c-7457d924e882.png)\r\n\r\n    Whereas this one looks odd, and doesn't account for the case when both activitybar and sidebar are hidden. It also leaves no space for menu items.\r\n\r\n    ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4033249/21311076/4dc9b8d4-c620-11e6-920d-a48a96eb90b2.png)\r\n\r\n## My thoughts\r\n\r\nOverall, I feel 3 is better than 1 in terms of usability and cross-platform design consistency.\r\n\r\nIt seems @bpasero already made a custom titlebar for macOS. If we choose design 3, I can try to make `titleBarStyle: custom` for Windows. If we choose to push the original idea forward, I want to get some input from the UX team for the usability concerns.\r\n\r\n/cc @bpasero @stevencl
