running the class names together and making them invalid.\r\n\r\nI've tested this with:\r\n\r\n`'editor.formatOnPaste': false`\r\n\r\nand it doesn't occur.

Enable 'format on paste'\r\n2. Put a string in the clipboard (eg., 'large')\r\n3.

VSCode Version: Latest Insider\r\n- OS Version: OS build 15063\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a file with code in it, the type does not matter.\r\n2. Arrow through the file at a rate of about twice per second, while NVDA is running.\r\n\r\nObserved Behavior:\r\nRather than speaking the focused line, NVDA will at times read the line or even several lines above it.\r\nInterestingly, braille output appears to work well enough.\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior:\r\nNVDA should speak the correct line when navigating through code, for a lot of people using screen readers do not use braille displays to compensate.\r\n\r\nSuspected cause:\r\nThe fact that braille works well and speech does not leads me to believe it takes too long for the focused line to be visible for NVDA.

In order to add coloring support for them I have to create a full theme and my extension users are forced to either have no coloring for these elements or have to say good bye to their beloved current theme. Instead it would be much better if I could augment the current theme (whatever it is) with additional entries from my extension's syntax definition and the colors for them. The `workbench.colorCustomizations` won't help here because it doesn't know what lexemes to color actually (in addition to the commonly used ones).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26724","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26724/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26724/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26724/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26724","id":228943512,"number":26724,"title":"Error: The mode has failed while tokenizing the input.","user":{"login":"darrenkenny","id":209306,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/209306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenkenny","html_url":"https://github.com/darrenkenny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenkenny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenkenny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenkenny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenkenny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenkenny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenkenny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenkenny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenkenny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenkenny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-05-16T07:49:35Z","updated_at":"2017-06-17T02:22:14Z","closed_at":"2017-05-16T12:24:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.13.0-insider (613724d43b4d50f6052bbb8007447ca96e687f26, 2017-05-16T06:10:52.652Z)\r\n- OS Version: Linux x64 4.1.12-94.1.8.el7uek.x86_64\r\n- Extensions: the listing exceeds the lower minimum of browsers' URL characters limit\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
