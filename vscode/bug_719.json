VSCode can't save it for some reason. When I try to hit cmd+w and then choose to save the svg file before quit, VSCode still fails to save it.\n\nVSCode becomes slow afterwards (high cpu usage?) and can't save any file before app relaunch.\n\n3) Try to close the VSCode editor using X icon - it doesn't close. When I close it using the \"save it immediately\" command (hold cmd > right click on VSCode icon at the dock > close now), it shows some glitches in the SVG file code and then quits without saving the file. It also doesn't restore the state of the file after the relaunch.\n\nLooks like VSCode fails to parse the SVG code and then goes into some frustration.\nRight now I can't save some needed SVGs and have to edit them using Sublime.\n\nYou can also try to paste the given SVG code into svgsprite.jade (this may also turn VSCode into \"unsaving mode\"):\n\n```
