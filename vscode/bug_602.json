of all thanks for a great editor, it's high time to give you some love back. 🙂 \r\n\r\nHere's the pull request to fix #15939, which essentially requests for a hotkey in Windows shell context menu.\r\n\r\nIt adds a `\"win32ShellHotkey\"` property in [product.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/651c27dc87bf92567b3236dabbbbad95d4db0360/product.json), allowing for hotkey customization.\r\n\r\nI suggest setting default value to \"o\" with following reason:\r\n* \"o\" is used already by Sublime Text - so if someone switches, he or she is already familiar with it! 😄 \r\n* \"c\" would be a fist pick here, as it's the first letter of \"Code\", however in default context menu you have already \"copy\" in context menu, which should have as easy access as possible,\r\n\r\nThe cool thing is that if you completely skip `\"win32ShellHotkey\"` property in product.json instead of crushing it simply won't cause an error in build process but will create no hotkey at all. And if you set it to empty, it will use the first letter from `product.nameShort`.\r\n\r\nAlso I think it should be case insensitive, so if you set it doesn't matter if you set it to `\"o\"` or `\"O\"`.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that I did not implement on purpose is handling for case when `product.win32ShellHotkey` character is not present in `product.nameShort`. Ideally we'd want to append it like: \"Open with Code - OSS (__y__)\" - but I wanted to keep it clean, and avoid unnecessary logic.
