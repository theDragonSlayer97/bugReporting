You can't. You just need to press \"Arrow Down\" key infinite times to figure it out. I think, that icons at the left of snippet can be more useful.\r\n\r\nFor example, Emmet icon - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24613274/29694642-7075c6a4-8946-11e7-9a96-902ec9b304de.png)\r\n\r\nhow it can be:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24613274/29694620-56b7be48-8946-11e7-92ec-646a877c2969.png)\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think about it? For my humble opinion, it looks better, and what is really necessary - it is more useful for developer. How is it more useful? When a developer will glance at the list - he will know for sure - 1) that he has required Emmet snippets in the list (there are tons of situations when snippet DO NOT appear, because of user mistake, vscode's bug etc.), and 2) user will choose the right snippet, not vscode core's basic \"dry\" snippet with nothing in it, but the right Emmet snippet.\r\n\r\nAlso it would be great to implement user icons (for example,  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24613274/29694854-ea79355c-8947-11e7-8087-4bc18ce5014b.png) ), for custom user snippets in HTML, CSS, JS,

Problem\r\nFor grammars with embedded languages, the outside scope's colorization can leak into the embedded language:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-24 at 4 26 07 pm

Notice that `text` is orange. No specific html grammar scope  applies to it so it picks up the foreground color of `string.template.js`\r\n\r\nInstead, in most cases I feel it would make more sense that `text` be colored the same at it would be in a normal html file, which in this case would be the default foreground color of the theme\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-24 at 4 38 32 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12821956/29693473-b07f6e78-88ea-11e7-890d-28620964be20.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Possible Approach\r\nI've already fixed this issue for `${expressions}` in normal js template strings. Manually handling each language and embedded language combination will not scale however. \r\n\r\nOne idea is to make themes treat the `meta.embedded` scope as a styling reset point. Themes would just use the same style for `meta.embedded` as for the default:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\"tokenColors\": [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"settings\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\"foreground\": \"#D4D4D4\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"background\": \"#1E1E1E\"\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"scope\": \"meta.embedded\",\r\n\t\t\t\"settings\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\"foreground\": \"#D4D4D4\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"background\": \"#1E1E1E\"\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t},\r\n      ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works in my initial testing but may have unintended side effects.

I am willing to forgo this, but I am wondering if there is a way to support the rename action and recent files.  Sorry for the \"not a bug\" ticket, but it's just very frustrating to keep getting thrown out of my project when I'm just trying to do some refactoring.  :-(","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4462","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"BD02:3670:A33FA4:1A4AB01:59D9329B","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=91>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=89>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"60e44a5500059df69e6f76c0c6856909\"","status":"200 OK"}}
