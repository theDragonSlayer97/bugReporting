request: provide an interface for the user to customize extension-specific colors/styles.\n\nSpecifically:\n1. allow an extension to declare various color/styling tag contributions with default values for dark, light, high-contrast, or particular color themes; to look up the current color/style for a tag; and to receive a notification when its color settings change.\n2. provide a way for the user to override or specify the colors for any color/style tag. For example:\n- via settings.json\n- via a color theme that specifies colors/styles for extension-specific tags. (Maybe allow the user to specify a backup theme for tags that the main theme does not specify.)\n- provide a UI for the user to customize a color theme, and in particular, allow the user to override select color settings and to specify those that the color theme does not (e.g. extension-specific colors).\n\nUse case: I'm working on an extension that makes heavy use of highlighting. (It is a theorem prover, where lines are highlighted green, blue, red, etc. to indicate what the theorem prover has accepted, rejected, or is still working on. There are ~10 highlights used). I want the colors for the highlights to be user-configurable.\n\nThe current solution: an extension can provide configuration settings for the user to specify colors. Problems with this approach:\n- coarse grain: it is limited to light vs dark themes\n- each extension has to reimplement this approach if they want user-specified colors\n- users have to deal with each extension providing a potentially different configuration syntax for a color/style setting.\n\nColors should not be hard-coded  by an extension. I believe that all extensions using `DecorationRenderOptions` or providing an HTML preview will benefit from a unified way for the user to specify colors.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14308","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14308/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14308/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14308/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14308","id":184897558,"number":14308,"title":"Save All doesn't include active document","user":{"login":"Dillie-O","id":991466,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/991466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dillie-O","html_url":"https://github.com/Dillie-O","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dillie-O/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dillie-O/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dillie-O/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dillie-O/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dillie-O/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dillie-O/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dillie-O/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dillie-O/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dillie-O/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-10-24T16:58:48Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T15:26:03Z","closed_at":"2016-10-24T19:12:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.6.1 (9e4e44c19e393803e2b05fe2323cf4ed7e36880e, 2016-10-13T15:27:10.246Z)\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.0.0\n- Extensions: Kasik96.format-indent-1.3.0, Telerik.nativescript-0.3.1, dbankier.vscode-instant-markdown-0.1.0, donjayamanne.python-0.5.0, ikappas.phpcs-0.6.1, lonefy.vscode-JS-CSS-HTML-formatter-0.2.1, makao.phpcsfixer-0.0.1, mohsen1.prettify-json-0.0.3, ms-vscode.PowerShell-0.7.2, wwwalkerrun.nativescript-ng2-snippets-1.2.0\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open up multiple files in the editor and make changes to all of them, but do not save them.\n2. Note how all of the files have the dot icon indicating.\n3. Select one of the files that are open to make it the \"active\" file.\n4. From the menu, select \"Save All\"\n\nExpected result: The circle icon is removed from all files since they have all been saved.\n\nActual result: The circle icon is removed from all files except the active file. It also appears that some code that was stored in the clipboard was automatically pasted in.\n\nNotes: \n\nAs an added means of verification, I've been using the NativeScript livesync feature and noted that all of the changes appear in the synchronized app simulator, except for the active file.\n\nAfter performing an undo action on the active file, to remove the odd content pasted into the status of the file goes to the \"unchanged\" status. It could be that the file is actually saving, but then a paste command is erroneously being executed by the app.\n\nI hope this helps. Keep up the great work. I love VS
