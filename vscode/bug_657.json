vscode offer a huge support of Typescript, i found so bad that it does not support Angular2 very well. Some alternatives exists, some extensions, but many are missing.\r\nFor exemple there is no link between styles, templates and JS file yet.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of usefull features that can be added in Typescript for some, and Angular2 for most : \r\n### template HTML Behaviour : \r\n_**Note:** For all this ones, it may be necessary to detect that file.component.html is angular2 template and not only html file._\r\n- Autocompletion for string interpolation and methods\r\n- CTRL+click on string interpolation go to definition\r\n- Angular2 HTML snippets (alternative extension : [Angular 2 TypeScript Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.Angular2) )\r\n- fast encapsulate current selection with **()** , **[]** or **{}** like **\"\"** and **' '** does: #15731 \r\n\r\n### inline HTML Behaviour : \r\n- missing syntax coloration (alternative extension : [angular2-inline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=natewallace.angular2-inline) )\r\n- command **editor.action.formatDocument** does not work properly (ALT+SHIFT+F)\r\n- Emmet is not working ( alternative : [\tAngular 2 TypeScript Emmet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jakethashi.vscode-angular2-emmet) )\r\n\r\n\r\n### JS/TS Behaviour : \r\n- Angular2 TS snippets (alternative extension : [Angular 2 TypeScript Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.Angular2) )\r\n- apply warning for unused import\r\n- when typing some variables names in TS, \":\" trigger autocompletion, exemple : #16072\r\n\r\n\r\n### General Behaviour : \r\n- commands to fast switch between ts / html / sass or css files ( alternative : [angular2-switcher ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=infinity1207.angular2-switcher) )\r\n- autoImport required Symbol / class / methods ( alternative : [TS Importer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pmneo.tsimporter) )\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those who wants an **icon theme** with angular icons, here is a suggestion : [VSCode simpler Icons with Angular](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davidbabel.vscode-simpler-icons).\r\nFor help, I suggest you to put **\"html.suggest.angular1\": false,** if you work on angular 2.\r\n\r\nFeel free to support this issue adding 👍 , and add your suggestions and extension recommandations, i will edit this.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16068/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16067","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16067/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16067/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16067/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/16067","id":191727046,"number":16067,"title":"inline

VSCode Version: 1.7.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n- Debugger for Chrome extension version: 2.2.2\r\n\r\nI drop a breakpoint into typescript code which will get hit after the page loads as expected.  I continue running in VS Code and then hit 'f5' in the browser; the breakpoint is hit again in VS Code, but the red breakpoint dot in VS Code moves up to an earlier line in the code.  The distance it moves up is equal to the number of empty lines before the breakpoint's original position.\r\n\r\nHere's what it looks like on first run:\r\n\r\n![On first run](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lvj0r3uq5gcw5t4/firstRun.png?raw=1)\r\n\r\nAnd here's what it looks like after continuing and then hitting refresh in Chrome:\r\n\r\n![On first run](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dap0vm0l72oxkui/afterRefresh.png?raw=1)\r\n\r\nApologies if this is caused by an obvious error on my part; this seems like something everyone would have hit, so I've created a minimum repro case of the issue to help demonstrate it.  I'd greatly appreciate any assistance in understanding what's going on.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download the ~4kb zipped project from here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/e8xu4157n9j3hxa/tsNSRepro.zip?dl=0\r\n2. npm install to get the dependencies, and ensure Chrome and the Debugger for Chrome extension are both installed\r\n3. Place a breakpoint on the \"console.log\" line in testApp.ts.\r\n4. Build the project and run.  The breakpoint should be hit and appear as per first picture above\r\n5. F5 to continue running in VS Code\r\n6. In the browser, hit F5 to refresh the page\r\n7. Note that in vs code the breakpoint is again hit, but the red dot has moved up the page.\r\n\r\nTry adding/removing blank lines and repeat the above, and note how the distance the red dot moves changes accordingly.\r\n\r\nHere's the typescript file in question:\r\n```\r\n// NOTE: Blank lines screw up breakpoint loc on F5.\r\n\r\n\r\nsetTimeout(function() {\r\n    console.log(\"i am a test\");\r\n}, 1000);\r\n```\r\n\r\n... and here's the gulpfile\r\n```\r\nvar gulp = require(\"gulp\"),\r\n    tsc = require(\"gulp-typescript\"),\r\n    sourcemaps = require(\"gulp-sourcemaps\"),\r\n    del = require(\"del\"),\r\n    runSequence = require(\"run-sequence\");\r\n\r\ngulp.task(\"clean\", function () {\r\n    return del([ \"testApp.js.map\", \"testApp.js\" ]);\r\n});\r\n\r\ngulp.task(\"build-testApp\", function (cb) {\r\n    var ts = tsc.createProject(\"tsconfig.json\");\r\n    return gulp.src([\"testApp.ts\"])\r\n        .pipe(sourcemaps.init())\r\n        .pipe(ts())\r\n        .pipe(sourcemaps.write(\".\", { includeContent: false, sourceRoot: \".\" })) \r\n        .pipe(gulp.dest(\".\"))\r\n});\r\n\r\ngulp.task(\"build-all\", function (cb) {\r\n    runSequence(\"clean\", \"build-testApp\", cb);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally, here's the diagnostic logging output after performing the above steps and F5'ing a couple of times - nothing seems to imply a failure to map breakpoints...\r\n\r\n```\r\nVerbose logs are written to C:\\Users\\jeffs\\.vscode\\extensions\\msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome-2.2.2\\vscode-chrome-debug.txt\r\n8:04:15 AM,

#12735 it is now possible to use any command ID in a variable with the ${command.xxxx} syntax.\r\n\r\nIf the command ID follows the common practice to use '.' as segment separators then using it with the 'command.' prefix makes things a bit unwieldy:\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\n  \"program\": \"${command.extension.node-debug.pickProcess}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suggest that we deprecate the ${prefix.id}
