Those tests run successfully via gulp until I bring in a class that, anywhere in its transitive closure of module references, pulls in 'vscode'.\n\nMy gulp output is below:\n\n```\n[14:00:48] Starting 'test'...\n[14:00:48] { [Error: Cannot find module 'vscode']\n  code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND',\n  name: 'Error',\n  message: 'Cannot find module \\'vscode\\'',\n  stack: 'Error: Cannot find module \\'vscode\\'\\n\nat Function.Module._resolveFilename     (module.js:325:15)\\n\nat Function.Module._load (module.js:276:25)\\n\nat Module.require     (module.js:353:17)\\n\nat require (internal/module.js:12:17)\\n\nat Object.<anonymous> (C:\\\\vsts-    vscode.repro.0\\\\out\\\\src\\\\myobject.js:2:18)\\n\nat Module._compile (module.js:397:26)\\n\nat     Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:404:10)\\n\nat Module.load (module.js:343:32)\\n\nat     Function.Module._load (module.js:300:12)\\n\nat Module.require (module.js:353:17)',\n  showStack: true,\n  showProperties: true,\n  plugin: 'gulp-mocha' }\n[14:00:48] 'test' errored after 45 ms\n[14:00:48] Error in plugin 'gulp-mocha'\nMessage:\n    Cannot find module 'vscode'\nDetails:\n    code: MODULE_NOT_FOUND\nStack:\nError: Cannot find module 'vscode'\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:325:15)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:276:25)\n    at Module.require (module.js:353:17)\n    at require (internal/module.js:12:17)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (C:\\vsts-vscode.repro.0\\out\\src\\myobject.js:2:18)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:397:26)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:404:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:343:32)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:300:12)\n    at Module.require (module.js:353:17)\n```\n\nIn the call stack, there's a reference to out\\src\\myobject.js:2:18.  At that location is this statement:\n\n```\nconst vscode_1 = require(\"vscode\");\n```\n\nIn my typescript source, that is:\n\n```\nimport { workspace } from \"vscode\";\n```\n\nIf I remove the code that uses workspace, the tests go back to running successfully.\n\nAfter going through the documentation regarding [node.js module resolution](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_all_together), I can understand why I get MODULE_NOT_FOUND.  Since \"vscode\" isn't a core module and isn't a relative reference (\".\", \"/\", \"../\"), node will look for the package.json file.  Assuming it finds it (procmon tells me it does), it looks for a \"main\" field.  I'm guessing, at this point, it doesn't find the \"main\" field and fails the resolution.\n\nPresumably, when running the tests in VS Code, the resolution also includes [locating the typings file](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html) and is thus successful.\n\nWhat I can't figure out is what I might do to resolve the reference to \"vscode\" when I run tests via gulp.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n**myobject.ts**\n\n```\nimport { workspace } from \"vscode\";   \nexport class MyObject {\n    constructor() {\n        let configuration = workspace.getConfiguration();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**myobject.test.ts**\n\n```\nimport { MyObject } from \"../src/myobject\";\nvar assert = require(\"chai\").assert;    \ndescribe(\"MyObject\", function() {\n    it(\"should verify MyObject\", function() {\n        new MyObject();\n    });\n});\n```\n\n**package.json** (scripts and dependencies)\n\n```\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"vscode:prepublish\": \"node ./node_modules/vscode/bin/compile\",\n  \"compile\": \"node ./node_modules/vscode/bin/compile -watch -p ./\",\n  \"postinstall\": \"node ./node_modules/vscode/bin/install\"\n},\n\"devDependencies\": {\n  \"chai\": \"^3.4.1\",\n  \"gulp\": \"^3.9.0\",\n  \"gulp-mocha\": \"^2.2.0\",\n  \"gulp-tslint\": \"^3.2.0\",\n  \"gulp-util\": \"^3.0.7\",\n  \"should\": \"^8.1.1\",\n  \"typescript\": \"^1.7.5\",\n  \"vscode\": \"^0.11.x\"\n},\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6585","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6585/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6585/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6585/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6585","id":156018432,"number":6585,"title":"Default thread name is displaying \"<No Name>\" in call stack.","user":{"login":"v-pavanp","id":17735796,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17735796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp","html_url":"https://github.com/v-pavanp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-20T18:01:24Z","updated_at":"2016-05-21T10:14:00Z","closed_at":"2016-05-21T10:14:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:1.1.0-alpha\n- OS Version: Windows10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

I recommend creating a new issue to report visual indicators on a per-line basis to assistive technology. Ramifications of this would be huge, major accessibility improvement if we pull this off. Proposed flow (feel free to copy to separate issue):\n\nuse code for spawning visual indicator next to line for assistive technology logic to determine what lines to flag. Guessing medium difficulty.\nCreate short, descriptive strings to indicate the function of the indicator. 'has breakpoint' ;has error' 'has warning', 'has monkey'...whatever other indicators exist within Code. I'd be the last person to know which ones exist ;) This isn't all that difficult, but don't make them longer than 2, maybe 3 words.\nNow this is where it gets interesting, because there's a number of things we can do here. What comes to mind, from most favorable to least favorable. Please chip in if anyone has other ideas:\n\nAppend the string to the end of the line being read by the screenreader. I don't know if this is even possible since you are going to somehow have to track focus within the multiline edit field the code is in and do some ARIA magic to append the string to the end of what is being read, maybe through an invisible live region of some kind.\nPlay a short sound when a particular indicator is required. A click, a short blip or ding, not entire symphonies please. We are trying to stay productive here :) Again, not sure how technically feasible this is. My JS isn't that advanced yet ;) For this approach the short strings as I suggested above would not be required\nAdd a hotkey that cycles between the various visual indicators that are present, speak the type of indicator and add a third hotkey to query what for example the error contents are. Perhaps the hotkey for querying error messages is a universal concept to all these ideas, I don't know what the visual flow for this is. D you hover over the indicator and it pops up or is it more involved? The reason this is lower down the list is because we would lose the 'live' aspect. Ideally this is added in after idea 1 or 2 has already been implemented.\nModify the line's formatting and make clear on the accessibility documentation page that screenreaders need to be set to read formatting changes. A lot of users have these settings disabled, and for good reason because it can get quite spammy. Screenreaders can query a line or character's formatting with a hotkey but only do so if they know some useful info might be gleaned from this. This will of course affect sighted users as well though, this is therefore an 'if all else fails' solution.\nWhat are your thoughts on all this? Implementing one of these solutions would fix this issue and a myriad of others, while shooting Code's accessibility up into the stratosphere.\n\nping @stevencl @alexandrudima

Follow instruction for project setup from https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/blob/master/debugger.md\n3. Launch app and open project folder.\n4.
