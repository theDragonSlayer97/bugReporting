Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Use Help > Report Issues to prefill these. -->\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.14.0\r\n- OS Version: Windows 7 Professsional\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create task.\r\n2. Create another task with similar configuration. Have to repeat all the configuration parameters such as:\r\n\"type\": \"shell\",\r\n\"problemMatcher\": [],\r\n\"presentation\": {\r\n        \"echo\": true,\r\n        \"reveal\": \"always\",\r\n        \"focus\": false,\r\n        \"panel\": \"dedicated\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"options\": {\r\n        \"cwd\": \"${fileDirname}\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"command\": \"\",\r\nThe only thing is different could be the \"args\", so why have to repeat everything. If tasks could be grouped they could share/inherit the same parameters. They could add or override the shared parameters, This would make it easier to create multiple tasks (e.g. build tasks for different build configurations).\r\n\r\nBTW: The Help, Report Issues menu entry has stopped filling in the VS Code, OS, extensions in the new issues window. Just tried to again and the details were filled in. May be an intermittent problem or a mistake on my part.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30635","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30635/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30635/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30635/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/30635","id":242763747,"number":30635,"title":"Use
