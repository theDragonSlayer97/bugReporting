Ctrl+P opening a new editor (which it does) and then adding that file to working files (which it doesn't). Instead the file is just revealed in the tree view and I have to double click on it to add it.\n\nSurely Ctrl+P should be viewed as a \"I mean to edit\" action and not \"Just a quick glance\"? Does anybody else share my view? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5554/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5553","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5553/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5553/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5553/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5553","id":149788073,"number":5553,"title":"Dark Theme JSX attributes grayed out ","user":{"login":"alexanderby","id":9638588,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9638588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderby","html_url":"https://github.com/alexanderby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderby/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":308114150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/themes","name":"themes","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-20T14:43:35Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T19:39:36Z","closed_at":"2016-04-20T19:39:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.0.0\n- OS Version: Windows 7, 10\n\nSee the screenshot, Dark theme compared to Monokai theme.

It should be shown as a subgroup similar to scope variables. \n\nFor me, and I believe I am not alone with that, the Variables and the Callstack sections are the most important. Now, my problem is that I actually use the Watch-section and therefore cannot just collapse it. That brings me the problem of managing it's size which effectively means I usually waste a lot of space at the bottom of the Variables and Watches section.
