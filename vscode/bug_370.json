Now there is a [lot of code to find a potential existing input and update it](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/html/browser/html.contribution.ts#L80), tho then still calling `open` which makes it even more weird.

finally caved to vscode's nagging and upgraded it (from a version I had downloaded in February, IIRC, but I'm not sure the version number) only to find that my custom keybinding suddenly broke.

Because the Mac keyboard has no End key, I remapped the keypad Enter to cover this functionality; it's conveniently placed, without being easy to make a typo on, and takes up a redundant key.\r\n\r\nI did this with the following line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t<END> = 104; // instead of 115, so my external Mac keyboard has an \"end\" button (the numpad Enter)\r\n```\r\n\r\nin `/usr/share/X11/xkb/keycodes/evdev`.\r\n\r\nEverywhere else in the OS this still works, and it worked in vscode too, before the upgrade just now.\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade, I tried to fix things using vscode's \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" preflet, but when I try to map cursorEnd to the numpad enter key, it gets input as \"enter\".  After that, it works, but then my regular Enter key (above Shift) now also functions as cursorEnd, so I have no way of inserting linebreaks.\r\n\r\nI hope the behaviour is reverted in future versions.\r\n\r\nThankfully I was able to downgrade by installing from here http://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode/pool/main/c/code/code_1.9.1-1486597190_amd64.deb and everything works
