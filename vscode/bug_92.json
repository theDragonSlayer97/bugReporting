2\r\n\r\n**OS**: \r\n- [x] Linux (see [the readme](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/blob/master/README.md#running-commands-on-linux) on how to set up docker on Linux) @weinand\r\n- [x] Mac @bpasero \r\n- [x] Windows @seanmcbreen \r\n\r\n## Issues\r\nPlease file issues in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\nInstall docker ...\r\nGet the extension bits ...\r\n``` console\r\ngit clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker\r\ncd vscode-docker && npm install\r\nvsce package\r\ncode-insiders --install-extension vscode-docker-0.0.16.vsix \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nThe latest Docker extension adopts the [Docker Language Server](https://github.com/rcjsuen/dockerfile-language-server-nodejs) and adds an Explorer contribution which lets you view and manage images and containers (running images). Dockerlint was removed and so were snippets in favor of the language server. \r\n\r\nThe extension was refactored to support using the same commands for both the explorer and the command palette. For example, if you invoke a \"start\" command on an Image in the explorer, that Image will be run. If you invoke a \"Start\" command from the command palette you'll get a quick pick of images to start.\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n\r\n**Language Server**\r\nCreate dockerfile and docker-compose files for Node or C# or Go workspaces. Validate IntelliSense/Completions, validation, etc.  Validate that the various `docker.languageserver.diagnostics.*` settings work.\r\n\r\n> Note that IntelliSense for DockerHub images has been [temporarily] removed in favor of adopting the language server.\r\n\r\n**Images**\r\nDownload and/or create local images, make sure they show up in the Explorer. Right click on the explorer to manipulate, start, stop, etc. images. Changes to images done through the terminal show up in the explorer, and vice versa. Run the same sets of commands via the Command Palette instead of the Explorer.\r\n\r\n**Containers**\r\nRunning and stopped containers should show up with different icons in the explorer. Right click to manipulate containers, make modifications to containers from the terminal and ensure they are reflected in the explorer. Run the same set(s) of commands via the Command Palette.\r\n\r\n**Bonus**\r\nSet up your machine to talk to a remote docker daemon. Everything should continue to work, but I've never tried this :)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33052","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33052/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33052/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33052/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33052","id":252478470,"number":33052,"title":"Rename

Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. -->\r\nIn reference to this thread: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15723\r\n\r\nI'd like to implement a \"Scan all\" command in my extension, that scans all of the relevant files in the workspace.  The easiest way to do this is to call workspace.OpenTextDocument, but doing so triggers an onDidOpen event that a lot of extensions listen for.  The result is that the \"Problems\" window doesn't just get the output of the analysis my own extension produces, but the output for every extension that generates problems and listens to the onDidOpen event.  Ideally I wouldn't inundate my users with output for other extensions when running a command for my own extension.  \r\n\r\nI don't need the onDidOpen event myself (I can just do a client.sendRequest in the \"then\" of openTextDocument to trigger my own analysis).  Is there any chance @dbaeumer that you changed your stance from the previous thread and there is now some mechanism to open a file without triggered an onDidOpen? I would argue that there is a difference between the user opening a file in the UI, and an extension opening a file that is never displayed in the UI.  In the latter case, probably doesn't make sense for anyone but that extension to know it opened (i.e. be able to suppress sending onDidOpen to any other extensions).\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33045","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33045/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33045/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33045/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33045","id":252411930,"number":33045,"title":"EsLint

VSCode Version: 1.16.0-insider\r\n\r\nAs a developer who loves the new ability to support multiple folders in a single workspace and who often has many files open from many folders, it would be nice to have a visual queue to identify which of my many open files come from which folders so I can more easily spot the files I'm interested in working on. \r\n\r\n**Acceptance criteria**\r\n* For example, I'd like my AuthService folder as have a light green background, and the tabs of files opened from the AuthService folder should also be light green.\r\n* The color would ideally be set in workspace settings or user settings.\r\n* The color would ideally take a theme color or a manual hex or rgba color.  Setting transparency level (rgba) might be especially nice for this
