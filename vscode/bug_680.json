VSCode Version: 1.7.1\r\n- OS Version: MacOS Sierra (10.12.1)\r\n\r\n- Easiest to demonstrate with HookyQR.beautify installed\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a project folder.\r\n2. Add a `.jsonbeautifyrc` file with\r\n```javascript\r\n{\"eol\": \"\\r\\n\"}\r\n```\r\n3. Create a json file, with content, that includes several lines. eg:\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n    \"beautify.language\": {\r\n        \"js\": {\r\n            \"type\": [\r\n                \"javascript\",\r\n                \"json\"\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. Set the document line end to **LF**\r\n5. Format with the beautify command (`F1->Beautify file`) -> No extra lines are produced.\r\n6. Format with \"Format Document\" -> ***An extra line will be produced for every existing new line***.\r\n\r\nYou can repeat step six over and over to add extra lines to the new extra lines.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by inconsistent handling of new lines in document edits between `TextEditor.edit` (returning a `TextEditorEdit`) and `TextEdit.replace` (and its siblings, I'm assuming - returning a `TextEdit`).\r\n\r\nThe beautify command calls `activeTextEditor.edit` to provide the changes. This works correctly, changing CRLF to LF when required.\r\n\r\nFormat Document (and Format Selection) call `TextEdit.replace` (as the callback requires an array of `TextEdit`s to be returned) and changes CRLF to LFLF, generating extra lines.\r\n\r\n*Also, as a side note:* it would be helpful if `FormattingOptions` included an `eol` property.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15384","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15384/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15384/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15384/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15384","id":188859494,"number":15384,"title":"File
