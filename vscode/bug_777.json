#12344\n\n**Bug**\nCurrently, markdown colorization is different for inlines of inside lists and quotes.

The generated CSS selector is more specific than the one for link descriptions, so the list foreground color overrides it.\n- Only apply special puctuator colorization to the start symbol for lists and quotes.\n\n<img width=\"402\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-09-22 at 10 35 16 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12821956/18759263/980199cc-80b0-11e6-8472-3d13303de163.png\">\n\nThis only currently updates the dark and light themes.

However, if I just open VSCode normally by clicking on the icon and drop the repository folder in it, it works perfectly fine.\nI think it’s since the last update of VSCode, but I’m not sure. It seemed to be ok before. SourceTree hasn’t been updated recently, but VSCode did.\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. You must use SourceTree, and set a custom command :\n   ![](http://files.italic.fr/Monosnap_2016-09-22_16-32-05.jpg)\n2. Then, open a repository with the custom command\n   ![](https://files.not.live/Capture_decran_2016-09-22_a_16.39.49.jpg)\n3. Go in the Git tab and let the sadness flow in your mind. 😢 \n   ![](http://files.italic.fr/BlogPost.vue_-_emmanuelbeziat_2016-09-22_16-41-16.jpg)\n\nI have no way to see if the problem come with
