VSCode Version: 1.12.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows Pro 10 x64 creators update (10.0.15603)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Set up environment with two monitors - primary being 100% DPI scaling and second being higher DPI (i.e. 200%) - a sample setup is HiDPI laptop (such as all Surface devices) with external monitor, where external monitor is the primary display device\r\n2. Log out and log in or restart OS to apply DPI settings completely\r\n3. Run vscode move it to the secondary screen with >100% DPI settings\r\n\r\nAt this point vscode window is scaled up.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that if the primary screen has 200% DPI (i.e. if Surface built-in screen is the primary display, or was primary display at the time the user has logged in), then vscode is not blurry - but then it is downscaled when moving it to the primary monitor.\r\n\r\nI believe this is because vscode windows are set to use `PROCESS_SYSTEM_DPI_AWARE` setting - which makes it use the DPI setting of the primary monitor, not the display it is currently at.\r\n\r\nAs vscode uses electron, which in turn uses webkit, it should be possible to use `PROCESS_PER_MONITOR_DPI_AWARE` setting - since chrome does support it properly for quite a while - chrome windows scale properly to each monitor's DPI settings.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27299","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27299/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27299/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27299/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27299","id":231465661,"number":27299,"title":"Extract

Open Javscript based project.\r\n2. Ability to retrieve intellisense for external javascript files.\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is currently possible , but I would like to know if one could get intellisense for a javascript based project using external javascript files. \r\n\r\nAs an example the structure of my company's platform has some modules that are located in `core`. The core is not included in the working environment, however it is bundled together when the application is deployed. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice to get intellisense for the core modules inside my workspace. The modules follow an npm commonjs pattern, and are located in a separate directory.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to include the modules globally within the workspace? This may be typescript related, but I was wondering if there is a recommended configuration in jsconfig.json or user settings. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nRyan","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27297/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27296","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27296/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27296/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27296/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27296","id":231443004,"number":27296,"title":"Hard
