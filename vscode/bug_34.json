It is through an identifier that we're able to match several extension versions against one another.\r\n\r\nWe are currently using the `publisher.name` tuple as an identifier. This is very beneficial in some scenarios such as VSIX side-loading, in which updates would still work seamlessly.\r\n\r\nThe Marketplace team intends to provide publisher/extension renames. This will break our assumptions that the `publisher.name` tuple is valid during its entire lifecycle. So we must only rely on the marketplace UUID returned from the Marketplace, which will stay consistent in renaming situations.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be adopted in a few places:\r\n\r\n- We should store the marketplace UUID into the extension's manifest, as soon as we are aware of it. Installing extensions from the Marketplace should immediately store that UUID.\r\n- Internally, extension matching should always be based on UUID. This should be the stored marketplace UUID or, in case it is nonexistent, the tuple `publisher.name`.\r\n- Our outdated mechanism currently prevents the loading of and deletes older versions of an extension, if multiple versions are installed into the user's extensions folder.\r\n- At startup, whenever an installed extension is found without UUID, we should attempt to match it against a marketplace extension and, if matched, store that UUID.\r\n- At VSIX installation time, we should attempt to match the extension against a marketplace extension and, if installed and matched, store that UUID.\r\n\r\ncc @sandy081 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34812/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34811","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34811/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34811/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34811/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34811","id":259744083,"number":34811,"title":"showQuickPick input events?","user":{"login":"nocksock","id":22164,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nocksock","html_url":"https://github.com/nocksock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nocksock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nocksock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nocksock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nocksock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nocksock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nocksock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nocksock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nocksock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nocksock/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":290465400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/api","name":"api","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":527005453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/quick-pick","name":"quick-pick","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-09-22T08:43:36Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T06:50:03Z","closed_at":"2017-09-25T06:49:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi there!\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there is a way to get input events for the `showQuickPick` dialog?

would enable Microsoft/TypeScript#14423.\r\nI am mostly describing changes to `protocol.ts` in the TypeScript repository here.\r\n@mjbvz @egamma @mhegazy we discussed this today.\r\n\r\n## 1\r\n\r\nThe returned `CodeAction` in a code action request may include a list of commands.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface CodeAction {\r\n    description: string;\r\n    changes: FileCodeEdits[];\r\n    command?: {};\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA code action may even have an empty `changes` list and consist of only a command.\r\nWe could choose specify that `command` must an of commands, although I'm not sure if that's worth bothering with.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2\r\n\r\nIf the code action is accepted, the editor must send the commands back to the language service to actually be carried out. This means needing a new request type, \"applyCodeFixCommand\".  This looks like:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface ApplyCodeFixCommandRequest extends Request {\r\n    command: CommandTypes.ApplyCodeFixCommand;\r\n    arguments: ApplyCodeFixCommandRequestArgs;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport interface ApplyCodeFixCommandRequestArgs extends FileRequestArgs {\r\n    command: {};\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe contents of `command` will just be what was sent to the editor.\r\n(Typically this will include a \"type\" field so the language service can dispatch on the type of action.)\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3\r\n\r\nThe language service should send a response when the action is complete.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface ApplyCodeFixCommandResponse extends Response {\r\n    body: {};\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm thinking we can just reuse the `message` field for error reporting and for a successful response. (Currently the field is documented to only be used if `success` is false.)
