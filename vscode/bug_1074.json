Update to 1.0 Release of VS Code\n\nWe have now completed engineering work for our “1.0” release of VS Code. However, with all of the excitement around [//Build](https://build.microsoft.com/), we've decided to take this opportunity to hold back our \"1.0\" release for just a couple of weeks, to get some more community testing on the product. Our “Insiders” release has been updated to match what we plan to ship in mid April. We encourage you to [download it today](http://code.visualstudio.com/insiders?wt.mc_id=DX_835018&utm_source=blogs&utm_medium=ms%20editorial&utm_campaign=GH%20Roadmap%201-0%20Update) ([release notes](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/vnext/release-notes/latest.md)), use it, and let us know if you find any critical ship stopping issues. In the meantime we're going to finish up work on the [1.0 documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs/tree/vnext/docs), clean up debt, unwind a bit, and start planning the future of Visual Studio Code.\n\n---\n\nMarch is our end game for the [Build 2016](http://build.microsoft.com/) milestone.

team,\n\nIn the early days of VSCode, there was a feature that I adored that allowed me to open the compiled output of my TypeScript files. By simply right clicking the source `.ts` file and clicking `Open derived output` I could view my `.js` output.\n\nThis feature was pulled due to not being able to find the compiled output if it was in a different directory.\nThere are many workarounds for this, but none as effective as this feature. I would love to see this re-added.\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3545","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3545/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3545/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3545/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3545","id":137134801,"number":3545,"title":"Do not hide interaction prompt when window loses focus.","user":{"login":"vilic","id":970430,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/970430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilic","html_url":"https://github.com/vilic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vilic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-02-29T02:48:47Z","updated_at":"2016-02-29T09:21:02Z","closed_at":"2016-02-29T09:21:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When install an extension, it takes quite a long time to load the list for me.

Add settings support for per-syntax or improve the Markdown syntax settings recognition.\n\n**Problems:**\nIn my project development, I usually works across different file types. Each of them is work a bit different than the another.\n\nLet say I have a `.js` (JavaScript) file and some `.md` (Markdown) file. When I works with `.js` file, I want to trim of the whitespace at the end of each line while when I works with `.md` file, I want the VSCode to keep the whitespace at the end of line as-is () since the markdown syntax use double-spaces at the end of line to indicate line break. When I enabled `files.trimTrailingWhitespace`, I cannot save the file without remove these trailing whitespace on `.md` file and that is annoying to me.\n\nAlso, this is just a simple usage example of this feature. There are many cases that this feature would solve them easily.\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n- Implement per-syntax settings so each file type can be configured differently (preferred).\n- Implement the \"smart settings\" where if you works with (let says) Markdown file and there are double-spaces at the end of line (or just any language feature at similar to this) with `files.trimTrailingWhitespace` turn on, VSCode will not trim those
