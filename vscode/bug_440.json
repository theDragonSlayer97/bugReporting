Or otherwise setting:\r\n```\r\n\"javascript.format.insertSpaceAfterOpeningAndBeforeClosingNonemptyBrackets\": true\r\n// or \"typescript.format.insertSpaceAfterOpeningAndBeforeClosingNonemptyBrackets\": true\r\n```\r\n...then formatting the line once there's already stuff inside it.\r\n\r\nI believe pressing space between a pair of brackets with nothing between them (`{}`) is more-or-less an unambiguous signal (in pretty much any language) that the user intends to have a padding space at both ends. It's also very similar to the already-covered case where someone instead presses enter to produce:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  | <- cursor\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Sublime Text I was able to add the functionality myself using a keybinding that looked (in their format) like:\r\n```\r\n{ \"keys\": [\"space\"], \"command\": \"insert_snippet\", \"args\": {\"contents\": \" $0 \"}, \"context\":\r\n  [\r\n    { \"key\": \"selection_empty\", \"operator\": \"equal\", \"operand\": true, \"match_all\": true },\r\n    { \"key\": \"preceding_text\", \"operator\": \"regex_contains\", \"operand\": \"\\\\{$\", \"match_all\": true },\r\n    { \"key\": \"following_text\", \"operator\": \"regex_contains\", \"operand\": \"^\\\\}\", \"match_all\": true }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n...but in VS Code there doesn't seem to be enough functionality available to add a keybinding like this - I can insert a snippet but can't see anything that would allow me to limit the context to the inside of a pair of brackets.\r\n\r\nIf someone points me to the place in the codebase where the similar behavior for pressing \"enter\" is defined, I might be able to open a PR myself.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22583/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22582","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22582/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22582/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22582/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22582","id":213970721,"number":22582,"title":"internal error: BuildFrameworkTcImports: no resolution of 'FSharp.Core, Version=4.4.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a''","user":{"login":"duicym","id":16585097,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16585097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duicym","html_url":"https://github.com/duicym","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duicym/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duicym/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duicym/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duicym/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duicym/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duicym/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duicym/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duicym/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duicym/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-14T05:14:18Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T08:04:19Z","closed_at":"2017-03-14T08:04:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
