mainly the default generated files from `generator-code`, a significant number of devDependencies (mostly recursive) are pulled in - mainly because of Mocha.

Perhaps create an output directory of everything `vsce ls` would find but _node_modules_, then run `npm install --production` and package that directory. Would certainly reduce the size of VSCode extensions.

[x] any os @bpasero\n\nWe have a new command to preview html for physical (living on disk) or virtual files. The command is called `vscode.previewHtml` and expects the uri of the resource to preview ([sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/vscode-api-tests/src/commands.test.ts#L42)).Test that:\n- you can preview full html documents (head & body) as well as body or content only documents\n- there is reasonable default theming\n- the command checks that you pass a uri\n- the preview reacts to resource changes\n- the preview can be rearranged. \n- the preview can run script but can't do harm\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2098","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2098/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2098/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2098/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2098","id":127388646,"number":2098,"title":"tslint

is independent of the other issues, and is a UI feature request.\n\nIt seems like a lot of user confusion comes up because you aren't following good design practices, namely exposing the state of the system. If a process crashes and you still expose all features in the UI that link into that process, you're intentionally harming the user experience and the perceived credibility of the product. If I click on something and nothing happens, it's really bad. If I _can't_ click on it because it's grayed out with the error **The JavaScript engine has crashed**, it's still bad, but now I know what's going on, and I have more confidence in the software. Right now my mental model of vscode is...well...not great, because about half of the UI doesn't work and I don't know why. At least if I know it's from a process crash I can say \"oh, it's not that 50% of this editor doesn't work, it's that one core process doesn't\" which gives me more faith in the system as a whole.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2093","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2093/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2093/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2093/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2093","id":127289133,"number":2093,"title":"\"Add

This has the advantage of allowing me to use the mouse less for view adjustment.\n\nI've noticed that there is a difference between how this behaves in the full Visual Studio and in Code. In Visual Studio, when you use Ctrl-Up/Down and the view moves such that the cursor is at the limit of the screen, then the editor will advance the cursor such that it remains on the last line visible. Code, however, does not do this, so the next time you hit a key (e.g. a cursor key without pressing Ctrl) then the view resets back to the line you were originally on which is quite jarring.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2091/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2090","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2090/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2090/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2090/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/2090","id":127259661,"number":2090,"title":"no snippets in comments","user":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-01-18T16:16:53Z","updated_at":"2016-01-19T09:11:12Z","closed_at":"2016-01-19T09:11:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/pulls/2090","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/2090","diff_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/2090.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/2090.patch"},"body":"@aeschli A quick (and dirty?) solution for overly aggressive snippet completions when typing comment text.
