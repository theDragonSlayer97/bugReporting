have received a lot of feedback on twitter about how the current default values `tabSize: \"auto\"` and `insertSpaces: \"auto\"` lead to confusion.\n\nThe reason is that these values mean that the

The guessing code is limited in cases where the file does not give sufficient hints and causes surprise to end users when some files resolve to `insertSpaces: true` and some to `insertSpaces: false` in a seemingly unpredictable manner.\n\nWe have decided to change the defaults to `tabSize: 4, insertSpaces: true` as this seems to be the most common used setting and because most of the compilers can handle spaces, while some compilers do not like tabs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1124","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1124/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1124/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1124/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1124","id":121194168,"number":1124,"title":"whether

`${fileBasename}`, but without the extension. Use case is I want to write a task configuration to run JUnit tests in Java (besides other tasks). My tasks.json:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"isShellCommand\": true,\n        \"suppressTaskName\": true,\n    \"linux\": {\n        \"command\": \"sh\",\n        \"args\": [\"-c\"]\n    },\n    \"windows\": {\n        \"command\": \"cmd\",\n        \"args\": [\"/C\"]\n    },\n    \"tasks\": [\n        {\n            \"taskName\": \"JUnit Test\",\n            \"args\": [\"java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ${fileBasename}\"],\n            \"isTestCommand\": true\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n(I'm using the workaround described in #981, but this is unrelated)\nThe task is supposed to run JUnit test for the currently opened file. The problem is, JUnit expects a class name, not a file name. So instead of MyTest.java I need to pass just MyTest. Please add a variable like `${fileBasenameWithoutExtension}`.
