VSCode uses value defined for login shell, not current session: \n   \n   Help > Toggle Developer Tools. And in Console,  `process.env.FOOBAR`  gives \"1\"  when I expect \"2\".\n\nIt looks like VSCode executes default shell as login shell again before launching the program UI.\n\nBeing able to pass different values for existing environment variables greatly helps writing/testing extensions.\n\nRelated discussion:  https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/220#issuecomment-203092824\n###### strace example:\n\n``` sh\n$ strace -E GOPATH=1 -E FOOBAR=2 -s 1000000 -e verbose=execve -e abbrev=none ./.build/electron/electron  .\nexecve(\"./.build/electron/electron\", [\"./.build/electron/electron\", \".\"], [... \"GOPATH=1\", ...]) # What I expected\n...\nread(62, \"...\\nGOPATH=/home/saml/go\\n....\")  # What is this?\n...\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4778","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4778/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4778/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4778/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4778","id":144391667,"number":4778,"title":"Can't column select first character on a line if drag left","user":{"login":"gregvanl","id":12818376,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12818376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl","html_url":"https://github.com/gregvanl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregvanl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":291057332,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/verified","name":"verified","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-29T21:21:18Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T17:24:03Z","closed_at":"2016-04-05T16:16:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- VSCode Version:0.10.13 insiders\n- OS Version:Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
