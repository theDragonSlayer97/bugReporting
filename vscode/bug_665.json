Open multiple tabs\r\n2. See how the closing \"x\" in on the right-side? Move it to the left-side.\r\n\r\nOne of the things Safari gets right is its placement of the tab close \"x\". By placing it on the left, you can quickly close tabs without moving the pointer about (since the left-side remains constant, while the right-side moves about based on tab name). It would be nice if VSCode did likewise. :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15833/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15832","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15832/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15832/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15832/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15832","id":190808911,"number":15832,"title":"Keep separate sizes for each viewlet (helps to read extensions better)","user":{"login":"DavidBabel","id":5599375,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5599375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBabel","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidBabel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBabel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBabel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBabel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBabel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBabel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBabel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBabel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBabel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidBabel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-11-21T19:13:09Z","updated_at":"2016-11-22T09:49:29Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"This is an simple **Enhancement proposal**.\r\n\r\nThe current behaviour for all the panel tabs (explorer / git / extension etc ...) is to keep its size permanently whatever the active tab is.
