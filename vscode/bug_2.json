Expected behavior is that the existing VSCode window will be activated / given focus.\r\n5. Instead, the VSCode icon on the taskbar flashes orange, but the window is not activated, requiring an extra click to activate it.\r\n\r\nThis is annoying when trying to use VSCode as an editor for writing git or svn commit messages (i.e. when used as GIT_EDITOR or SVN_EDITOR).\r\n\r\nAs a workaround for now, I am able to use this code-focus.cmd file to activate the window before invoking VSCode:\r\n\r\n`@echo off`\r\n`echo (new ActiveXObject(\"WScript.Shell\")).AppActivate(\"Visual Studio Code\"); > %temp%\\focus.js`\r\n`cscript //nologo %temp%\\focus.js`\r\n`del %temp%\\focus.js`\r\n`code %*`\r\n\r\nI can then invoke this file instead of VSCode in my GIT_EDITOR and SVN_EDITOR environment variables.\r\n\r\nI've just started using VSCode for this purpose, so don't know if this behavior is new (due to either the Windows 10 Creator's Update or the September 2017 update to VSCode) or has always been this way.\r\n\r\nMay be related to: electron/electron#2867\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35764","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35764/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35764/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35764/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35764","id":263576287,"number":35764,"title":"[BUG] Recent in Welcome page is not the same as Recent in Task Bar","user":{"login":"Mlocik97-issues","id":31345346,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/31345346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mlocik97-issues","html_url":"https://github.com/Mlocik97-issues","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mlocik97-issues/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mlocik97-issues/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mlocik97-issues/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mlocik97-issues/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mlocik97-issues/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mlocik97-issues/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mlocik97-issues/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mlocik97-issues/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mlocik97-issues/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":711817634,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/new%20release","name":"new release","color":"006b75","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-10-06T21:26:26Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T21:26:30Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.17.0 c[ be377c0faf7574a59f84940f593a6849f12e4de7 ]\r\n- OS Version: Windows 8.1 64-bit & Linux Ubuntu 16.04.2 Gnome 3\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

Given the full feature set of quick-open, the slow performance makes sense - but I really need to solve the simpler subproblem of typing an exact filename (or even exact path) of a source file and getting it to open within say 5 sec (it currently takes 5 min). \r\n\r\nThe subset of files I care about is small, and doesn't change often. I only need this to work for a limited set of extensions (ie, .cpp, .h. .py) and a limited subset of the filesystem where we store source files. It seems like this should be easy enough to handle with a small cache of source files scraped out of a larger tree...\r\n\r\nDo I have any options for this with VS Code's current implementation?  I've already pruned some folders with file.excludes, but it doesn't seem to make a noticeable impact on performance. Since the editor is responsive after I've issued a query once, is there a way to write a script to prepopulate a cache with the files I care about?\r\n\r\nI'm also willing to write my own extension, but I can't find a way take additional user input (ie a target filename) from the command palette - all the examples simply execute based on the name of the command. If this feature is easy to add, I'd happily do the legwork to build my own cached search over a limited database of relevant files.\r\n\r\nAny help would be much
