Customization](http://docs.emmet.io/customization/)\r\n\r\nClear all emmet related settings.\r\n\r\n- Try emmet abbreviations expansions in an html file. (type any html element and hit tab: div => `<div></div>` a => `<a href=\"\"></a>`)\r\n- Html elements that do not have closing tags (like `br`, `hr`, `input`, `img`) expand just to a single tag like `<br>`, `<hr>`, `<input type=\"text\">`, `<img src=\"\" alt=\"\">`\r\n- Abbreviations like `.title` would expand to `<div class=\"title\"></div>`\r\n- Try emmet abbreviations expansions in a css file. Check out the CSS part of [Emmet CheetSheet](http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) (m10 would expand to \"margin\": 10px, c#1c would expand to \"color: #1c1c1c)\r\n\r\nSettings from external files:\r\n\r\n- Create a folder anywhere. Create the below 3 files in this folder\r\n      - `syntaxProfiles.json` with content: `{\"html\":\"xhtml\"}`\r\n      - `preferences.json` with content: `{\"css.color.case\": \"upper\", \"css.intUnit\": \"pt\" }`\r\n      - `snippets.json` with content: \r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"html\": {\r\n            \"abbreviations\":  {\r\n                    \"a\": \"<a href=\\\"\\\"  target=\\\"blank\\\">\"\r\n               }\r\n          }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- add setting `emmet.extensionsPath` with value as absolute path to this folder. \r\n\r\nNow repeat your previous emmet expansions with html and css. The settings from the 3 json files would be loaded and you will see the below differences\r\n- HTML elements that do not have closing tags, now get a self closing tag. Eg: `<br />`, `<input type=\"text\" />` etc. This is due to the `syntaxProfiles.json`\r\n- The abbreviation `a` that would previously expand to  `<a href=\"\"></a>`,  now expands to  `<a href=\"\" target=\"\"></a>`. This is due to the `snippets.json`\r\n- The CSS abbreviation `m10` now expands and use `pt` instead of `px`. And `c#1c` when expanded has upper case. This is due to `preferences.json`.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd the below to your settings file.\r\n```\r\n\"emmet.syntaxProfiles\": {\r\n      \"html\": {\r\n            \"attr_quotes\": \"single\"\r\n             }\r\n},\r\n\"emmet.preferences\": {\r\n      \"css.color.case\": \"lower\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow repeat your previous emmet expansions with html and css. The User/Workspace settings should override the settings from the external files and you would see the below differences:\r\n\r\n- HTML elements that do not have closing tags are back to the old behaviour of not getting self closing tags\r\n- `.title` now expands with single quotes for attributes instead of double\r\n- In CSS file, `c#1C` and `c#1c` both will get expanded with lower case\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n- Changes in User/Workspace settings should get reflected without VS Code reload.\r\n- Changes to the external files will get reflected only on VS Code reload.\r\n- `~` not supported in `emmets.extensionsPath` at the moment\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19078","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19078/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19078/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19078/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19078","id":202634587,"number":19078,"title":"Terminal

#13625, #17875\r\n\r\n- [x] Linux @roblourens \r\n- [x] OSX @bpasero \r\n- [x] Windows @dbaeumer \r\n\r\nComplexity: 4 (ideally someone fairly familiar with terminals and curses apps)\r\n\r\nMuch of the terminal frontend xterm.js was rewritten for performance this version, here is a summary of what happened:\r\n\r\n- The parser was rewritten for performance\r\n- A catch up mechanism was added which utilizes XOFF/XON signals to tell the pty process to stop while the parser and renderer catch up\r\n- Rendering is now done asynchronously in an animation frame callback\r\n- Additional frame skipping was added to prevent printing to the viewport when the result would change 20ms later anyway\r\n- A circular list is now used to manage the buffer, promoting memory reuse, reducing GCs and automatically handling trimming of the buffer to conform with the scrollback value (amount of lines kept in the buffer)\r\n- General rendering performance improvements\r\n\r\nAdditionally on Windows the library used to simulate pseudoterminals has been upgraded several versions and cleaned up which was a huge change that should fix many bugs such as:\r\n\r\n- Arrow keys wording in Bash on Windows https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10163\r\n- Git Bash, Bash on Windows prompt and other shells having their prompt getting out of sync when using backspace https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7345\r\n- Prompt screwing up when using tab https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16914\r\n- Many other issues https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14613\r\n\r\nAs a result a fairly broad test would be ideal. Here are some areas to focus on:\r\n\r\n- Running commands that generate a lot of output, I used `ls -lR` extensively to test during development\r\n- Applications such as less, vim, nano, git, etc. act as expected\r\n- The scroll bar accurately represents the current viewport\r\n- The terminal behaves when the terminal buffer is not full (new terminal) and full (buffer length = scrollback)\r\n- Test with different shells\r\n  - Linux/OSX: bash, zsh\r\n  - Windows: cmd, powershell, Git Bash, Bash on Windows (may require Windows

the entire style of tokens is left to the mercy of the color theme.\r\n\r\nThat means that you might, like me, find the perfect _color_ combination, but the theme doesn't render keywords bold and it renders comments without italics. In other words, there are permutations of settings that aren't solved by the one-size-fits-all approach of today.\r\n\r\nThe only way to fix is to fork the theme and edit it, which shouldn't be necessary. For example, if I release my forked theme, then I'm forcing all users to accept italic comments, but this might be the one detail that isn't to their liking. This further leads to a proliferation of themes that make just minor changes to other themes.\r\n\r\nTo me, \"color theme\" does not imply something that should control how tokens are styled.

If I enable \"Solarized Dark\" (one of the few themes that uses bold styling), some languages (JavaScript) will render bold keywords, whereas others (Go) will not.

@kieferrm\r\n\r\nComplexity: 2 (it involves mostly looking / making selections in the editor but this explanation is long so giving it a 2)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere is a new type of rendered view line in the editor.\r\n\r\n\r\nA rendered view line is used to reply to queries of the type:\r\n* at what px offset is a column rendered, (e.g. rendering decorations, cursor position, selection, etc.)\r\n* what column sits at a px offset (i.e. hit-testing with the mouse).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new `FastRenderedViewLine` is used (dynamically) under the following conditions:\r\n* the font you are using is monospace for regular ASCII characters (in the range 32-126), (including for &middot; and &rarr;)\r\n* a line contains only regular ASCII characters (in the range 32-126) or `\\t`\r\n* a line does not contain any before/after decorations (such as those added by CSS color boxes)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new `FastRenderedViewLine` does not ask the DOM for column -> px offset transformations, but simply computes the results using basic math. This has a considerable speed advantage, as the browser is not forced to do a synchronous layout, but the results may be wrong if our assumptions don't hold true. \r\n\r\n**This perf improvement is important because most of our users use a monospace font and most of the source code is regular ASCII + tabs. It also gives us some breathing room in the time it takes to paint a frame, that could be later used for fancy features as a minimap**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### standalone editor setup\r\n* clone https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor next to vscode\r\n* `monaco-editor` and `vscode` should be sibling folders\r\n* run `gulp watch` as usual in `vscode`\r\n* run `npm install .` in `monaco-editor`\r\n* open `monaco-editor/test/index.html` in a browser (file protocol will do)\r\n* click on `dev` next to monaco-editor the url should now contain `?editor=dev`\r\n* To change a font in the standalone editor, edit the file index.html such that you pass a font familiy to the editor, e.g `fontFamily: \"arial\"`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Check \"exception cases\":\r\nCheck that the cursor is correctly rendered in between characters in any of the following 3 cases:\r\n* configure a font family such as Arial.\r\n* have on a line some text that is outside the regular ASCII chars (e.g. an emoji, ü, CJK text, Hebrew text).\r\n* go to a line in a CSS file that uses color boxes.\r\n\r\n### Test that `FastRenderedViewLine` is correct:\r\n* configure a font family that is monospace (or leave our default)\r\n* have a line that is at least ~100 chars of regular ASCII (100 chars such that rounding errors begin to show)\r\n* avoid CSS color boxes (i.e. use a different language)\r\n\r\nPlease check:\r\n* that you can change `window.zoomLevel` (in standalone editor browser zoom).\r\n* start without a zoom level, zoom in, zoom out.\r\n* start with a zoom level, reset zoom, etc.\r\n* change the font size, change the font family dynamically\r\n* in all these cases the cursor should not appear to be off.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ne.g. what an \"off\" cursor looks

Try to configure them for different languages in user and workspace settings and test that these are getting applied correctly (workspace settings always override user settings).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19059","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19059/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19059/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19059/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19059","id":202592800,"number":19059,"title":"Test User/Workspace Settings Improvements #18094","user":{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/33","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/33","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/33/labels","id":2133194,"number":33,"title":"January 2017","description":"","creator":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":738,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-11-14T11:19:32Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T13:32:32Z","due_on":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-02-03T06:13:52Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-01-23T17:05:23Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T22:56:27Z","closed_at":"2017-01-24T22:56:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Test for #18094\r\n\r\n- [x] any OS @alexandrudima \r\n- [x] any OS @ramya-rao-a \r\n\r\nComplexity : 3\r\n\r\nTest this by verifying following.
