the introduction of tabs and editor stacks to VS Code, we introduced many new commands and changed some existing ones. Due to the fact that the **Working Files** view is replaced by the **Opened Editors** view, some commands also got replaced by others. Below is a list of changed and new commands:\n\n**Changed Commands**\n- `workbench.action.focusFirstEditor` => `workbench.action.focusFirstEditorGroup`\n- `workbench.action.focusSecondEditor` => `workbench.action.focusSecondEditorGroup`\n- `workbench.action.focusThirdEditor` => `workbench.action.focusThirdEditorGroup`\n- `workbench.action.focusLeftEditor` => `workbench.action.focusPreviousGroup`\n- `workbench.action.focusRightEditor` => `workbench.action.focusNextGroup`\n- `workbench.action.moveActiveEditorLeft` => `workbench.action.moveActiveEditorGroupLeft`\n- `workbench.action.moveActiveEditorRight` => `workbench.action.moveActiveEditorGroupRight`\n- `workbench.action.openPreviousEditor` => `workbench.action.openPreviousEditorFromHistory`\n- `workbench.files.action.addToWorkingFiles` => `workbench.action.keepEditor`\n- `workbench.files.action.closeAllFiles` => `workbench.action.closeAllEditors`\n- `workbench.files.action.closeFile` => `workbench.action.closeActiveEditor`\n- `workbench.files.action.closeOtherFiles` => `workbench.action.closeOtherEditors`\n- `workbench.files.action.focusWorkingFiles` => `workbench.files.action.focusOpenEditorsView`\n- `workbench.files.action.openNextWorkingFile` => `workbench.action.nextEditor`\n- `workbench.files.action.openPreviousWorkingFile` => `workbench.action.previousEditor`\n- `workbench.files.action.reopenClosedFile` => `workbench.action.reopenClosedEditor`\n- `workbench.files.action.workingFilesPicker` => `workbench.action.showAllEditors`\n- `workbench.action.cycleEditor` => `workbench.action.navigateEditorGroups`\n\n**New Commands**\n- `workbench.action.showEditorsInGroup`: show all editors of a group\n- `workbench.action.clearEditorHistory`: clear navigation history and list of recently closed editors\n- `workbench.action.closeEditorsInGroup`: close all editors of a group\n- `workbench.action.closeEditorsInOtherGroups`: close editors in other groups\n- `workbench.action.closeEditorsToTheLeft`: close editors to the left of the active one\n- `workbench.action.closeEditorsToTheRight`: close editors to the right of the active one\n- `workbench.action.openLastEditorInGroup`: open last editor in group\n- `workbench.action.openEditorAtIndex[1-9]`: open editor at index\n- `workbench.action.openNextRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup`: navigate forwards in MRU list of editors of a group\n- `workbench.action.openPreviousRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup`: navigate backwards in MRU list of editors of a group\n### Settings for old non-stacks behaviour\n\nIf you want to configure VS Code to get some of the old behaviour back, see the following configurations.\n#### Ctrl+Tab to navigate in entire editor history\n\nYou can change keybindings for `Ctrl+Tab` to show you a list of all opened editors from the history independent from the editors that are opened in a stack. Edit your keybindings and add the following:\n\n``` json\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+tab\", \"command\": \"workbench.action.openPreviousEditorFromHistory\" },\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+tab\", \"command\": \"workbench.action.quickOpenNavigateNext\", \"when\": \"inQuickOpen\" },\n```\n#### Close an entire group instead of a single editor\n\nIf you liked the behaviour of VS Code closing an entire group when closing one editor, you can bind the following in your keybindings configuration:\n##### Mac\n\n``` json\n{ \"key\": \"cmd+w\", \"command\": \"workbench.action.closeEditorsInGroup\" }\n```\n##### Windows/Linux\n\n``` json\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+w\", \"command\": \"workbench.action.closeEditorsInGroup\" }\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6605/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6604","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6604/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6604/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6604/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6604","id":156085860,"number":6604,"title":"Allow

Open multiple editor groups\n2. Click on the command overflow (ellipses) button\n\n---\n\nI found it a little too easy to accidentally close all the editors in the entire window.\n\n<img width=\"693\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-05-20 at 3 47 17 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11839736/15444152/a6b918b6-1ea2-11e6-829b-97410f1b9cc5.png\">\n\nThis could be detrimental to a user's layout.  Therefore, I think we should prompt confirmation before closing all editors (as it is sort of a destructive change). No need to prompt for closing all editors in group, though, as that is less destructive.\n\n@stevencl do you agree?\n\n**Just my opinion:** Also, what I was expecting to be at the bottom of this list was \"Close All Editors in Group,\"  as that's a command I would use frequently (and the bottom of a context menu is so easy to hit without thinking).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6595","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6595/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6595/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6595/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6595","id":156064886,"number":6595,"title":"about
