https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/140#issuecomment-165473225 @egamma recommends installing @dbaeumer's `vscode-eslint` extension.\n\nWhile doing this, I notice that I can search for `vscode-eslint` in the Install Extensions dialog. I find the correct extension, but the results pane does not show me the `vscode-eslint` that I searched for (`name` in `package.json`). It shows `displayName`, `description`, `version`, and `publisher`.\n\nI was left wondering if that was the right package, because it said `ESLint`, and I couldn't see `vscode-eslint` anywhere.\n\nIn the case where a user searches on `name`, and VS Code finds a match, if the results pane contained feedback that the package listed is the right package, it would be good. \n\nAn idea: Maybe show `name` in the results if the match was on `name`?\n\nI've attached a screen shot - hope that clarifies what I'm talking about. \n\nThanks!\n\n![screen shot 2015-12-18 at 7 31 05

there, we are writing a VSCode extension for Telerik NativeScript projects and one of the biggest requirements from our customers is to enable Intellisense for the UI declarations which are written in XML files. We have a schema declared on the root Page element, but it seems to be ignored at the moment.\n\nIs this something that is supposed to work, or are we missing something. \n\nHere is a sample of an XML file (taken from our repo - https://github.com/NativeScript/template-hello-world):\n\n```\n<Page xmlns=\"http://schemas.nativescript.org/tns.xsd\" loaded=\"pageLoaded\">\n  <StackLayout>\n    <Label

have a suite of projects that I'd like to have a shared configuration (e.g. all the repos at my company). \n\nCurrently we have duplicate `.vscode/settings.json` files, and several common

Some projects have additional tasks defined beyond the common ones.\n\n---\n\nI'm unsure what the right approach to take here is. I'd love some input\n- Can extensions apply user settings, or define tasks/problem matchers? The docs [don't seem to indicate that](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points).\n- Can a project declare a VS Code extension as a dependency? (seems unlikely, but hey :P)\n- We're toying with the idea of a common package with a `postinstall` script that symlinks the configuration in (and just over-defining tasks) - but it's pretty ugly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1435/reactions","total_count":23,"+1":23,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1434","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1434/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1434/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1434/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1434","id":122871737,"number":1434,"title":"Show
