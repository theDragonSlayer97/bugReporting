This means that if a user changes its theme he/she will also need to change those settings for those decorators to not look out of place. With the ability to set a custom background colors those decorators will look right no matter the theme.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35378","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35378/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35378/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35378/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35378","id":261650026,"number":35378,"title":"Spanish translation gives different meaning to some options.","user":{"login":"F1r3f0x","id":25118702,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/25118702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/F1r3f0x","html_url":"https://github.com/F1r3f0x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F1r3f0x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F1r3f0x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F1r3f0x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F1r3f0x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F1r3f0x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F1r3f0x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F1r3f0x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F1r3f0x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F1r3f0x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"danyeh","id":19785531,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19785531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh","html_url":"https://github.com/danyeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"danyeh","id":19785531,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19785531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh","html_url":"https://github.com/danyeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-09-29T13:54:46Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T13:39:10Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
