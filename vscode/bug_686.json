However, if you did found something about it, please post in here a link for us.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15189","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15189/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15189/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15189/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15189","id":188052054,"number":15189,"title":"externalConsole dont support Chinese","user":{"login":"lyj2576","id":22914094,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/22914094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyj2576","html_url":"https://github.com/lyj2576","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyj2576/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyj2576/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyj2576/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyj2576/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyj2576/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyj2576/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyj2576/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyj2576/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyj2576/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-11-08T17:20:04Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T10:09:02Z","closed_at":"2017-04-06T10:08:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.7.1\r\n- OS Version: windows 10 pro\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to print Chinese on the externalConsole , it just showed me the garbled message:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22914094/20109231/119777d2-a61a-11e6-83fc-db77f7f7c30e.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\r\nConsole.WriteLine(\"世界，你好！\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut when I tried to print the same text on the debug console, it showed just as expected!\r\nI cannot fix the problem by myself, and I need help!
