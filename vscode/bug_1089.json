most Linux desktops `alt+click` will allow you drag a window by clicking anywhere over it. This conflicts with the multiple cursors binding.\n\nIt's still possible to obtain multiple cursors with commands like `insertCursorAbove` or `insertCursorAtEndOfEachLineSelected`, but this affects multiple people, and it's already covered in some [articles](https://2buntu.com/articles/1529/visual-studio-code-comes-to-linux/#multiple-cursors_3044) with a workaround (which I'm copying here for Gnome based systems: `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences mouse-button-modifier \"<Super>\"` change `<Super>` with your preferred key )\n\nIt's also acknowledged [in VScode's documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/editingevolved#_selection-multicursor) that this shortcut might conflict even on Windows or Macosx...\n\n> Note: Your graphics card provider might overwrite these default shortcuts.\n\nSo, fixing this for Linux users might also be useful elsewhere. For comparison, the Atom editor uses `ctrl+click` instead of `alt+click` for this shortcut.\n\nRather than changing the default, making it customizable would already be a welcome improvement, but afaik unfortunately there's no way to change it. These are a couple of related default keybindings:\n\n```\n{ \"key\": \"ctrl+shift+up\",         \"command\": \"editor.action.insertCursorAbove\",\n                                 \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\" },\n{ \"key\": \"shift+alt+up\",          \"command\": \"editor.action.insertCursorAbove\",\n                                 \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\" }\n```\n\nBut since I cannot find any `editor.action.insertCursor` command, it seems that this option is

CancellationToken, TextEdit , Range} from 'vscode';\n\n```\nexport class GoCommentsProvider implements OnTypeFormattingEditProvider {\n\n    public provideOnTypeFormattingEdits(document: TextDocument,
