Start VSCode\n2. Close VSCode\n\n**Detailed description:**\n\nI've recently installed VSCode for the first time on my system. I've noticed that after closing VSCode a couple of processes remain active namely `code/code`, `Microsoft.VSCode.CPP.Extension.linux` , `code/code /usr/share/resources/app/out/bootstrap --type=SharedProcess` and probably a bunch of others which I haven't found yet. `code/code` is (if I'm not mistaken) the main process of VSCode. And the fact that all other processes remain in memory can only mean that VSCode hasn't actually closed and keeps running in the background.\n\nThe first time my alarm bell rang was when my system exhibited high memory usage and high CPU usage (resulting in a core temperature of 68 degrees Celsius or so with the usual temperature being approx. 50). I then noticed that this happened **quite often** (but **not always**) after I used VSCode. When I opened `htop` to view the active processes I was really surprised to find out that `Microsoft.VSCode.CPP.Extension.linux` was there and it was eating up approx. 25% of my CPU resources...half an hour or so after closing VSCode. Further investigation showed me the other processes related to VSCode that I've mentioned above.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9014","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9014/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9014/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9014/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9014","id":164689019,"number":9014,"title":"Deleting

Update Emmet to **1.6.0** version. Changelog for Emmet in addition to the asynchronous API:\n   1. Added a meta tag for Edge [commit](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet/commit/6026cec2ec60e9ea3229a02b2d044b93f02d9790)\n   2. Resolved [#428](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet/issues/428) [commit](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet/commit/c4a4cf495407c7a0da597f4f77df72421eb60eaf)\n   3. Fixed annoying issue with locating CSS rule [commit](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet/commit/4b440ae9be9f9ec33a93d84a216fd9ac1cb1ec36)\n   4. Added code snippets for SVG [commit](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet/commit/6efa2234cd3a72a9bd1232fa79783a878d556107)\n   5. Added `meta:redirect` snippet [commit](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet/commit/4b02f62d61be7b44a30d583f73e39e8785ceb78b)\n   6. Added more boolean attributes for `profile.booleanAttributes` [commit](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet/commit/96996d46d1e3735be81a95781969adcc2e95495d)\n   7. Switched to extenal _Can I Use_ database [commit](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet/commit/7aa7e4a69a341cf545878e53974e469062b35d64)\n2. Support of **SVG**, based on open file extension is added.  (see 1.4).\n3. The process of set/reset settings and snippets for Emmet has been simplify. We don’t have to support undocumented features of Emmet, which don’t have any sense for the end user. \n4. The checking for the case when user specify the path, which open out of the current directory. \n5. Added function `buffer` in the file `src/vs/base/node/request.ts`, since the function `text` returns a string. This function returns the buffer.\n6. Added layer between Emmet and methods Editor for work with the file system (**FileAccessor**).\n7. **FileAccessor** is enabled only for actions `Encode\\Decode` and `Update Image Size`.\n8. The emulator of **prompt** function, which used in file `base64` for transmit path to the Emmet, has been delete (it is not necessary in version 1.6.0).\n9. The action **Encode\\Decode** is again enabled.\n## Why the `base64` has a lot of code?\n\nFor user comfortable it’s necessary to process several situations: \n1. Decoding a data:URL image is only available inside a workspace folder.\n2. Checking the validity of path:\n   1. The path must be inside of open directory.\n   2. The filename must consist valid symbols. \n3. If the file with specified name is already exist, it’s necessary to provide the user a choice (overwrite)\n## Automated tests\n\nI try to create automatic tests for this command, but got an editor error. The log is below. The source code for the test: [Gist](https://gist.github.com/mrmlnc/1dcb04bb7f0b4358dd60de8464ae3d96).\n\nDespite of error, `console.log` in the test (inside the test file) file displays the correct result. I can’t find a reason of this. \n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n\nError log: `Cannot read property 'getStartPosition' of null`</summary>\n\n\n\n``` shell\n    WARNING: Promise with no error callback:58\n
