I am compiling with a simple makefile using the visual studio command line tool. \nSince the last update, from time to time when executing my build task, I get the error message \"Invalid Marker Service State\" and the little spinning bar, indicating that a task is in progress, wont stop spinning. As far as I can tell the build task completes normally and my problem matchers seem to catch all problems. Unfortunately I cant tell what exactly triggers this problem, but it happens quite frequently, about every 15 compilations, which has me restarting VS Code to reset the task in progress indicator.\n\n![taskfile](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7150993/19600172/19a7dbda-97a4-11e6-8e98-412fa7007404.png)\n\n![error](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7150993/19600183/292df6fc-97a4-11e6-8e50-331f37004d4a.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14157","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14157/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14157/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14157/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14157","id":184483271,"number":14157,"title":"Searching for text (CTRL+Shift+F) is too slow","user":{"login":"xucaen","id":17462261,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17462261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xucaen","html_url":"https://github.com/xucaen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xucaen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xucaen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xucaen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xucaen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xucaen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xucaen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xucaen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xucaen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xucaen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-10-21T13:22:44Z","updated_at":"2016-11-22T05:50:33Z","closed_at":"2016-10-21T18:42:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.6.1 (9e4e44c19e393803e2b05fe2323cf4ed7e36880e, 2016-10-13T16:21:53.542Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 6.1.7601\n- Extensions: Kasik96.format-php-1.1.2, ullissescastro.theme-bracketsdark-1.0.1\n\nEvery time I search for something in my project, the search in files hangs, sometimes longer than 10 minutes.

to Sublime counterpart, If i write \"fma\" in VSC to match \"fuzzyMatching\", no completion is given, the same is for \"fuzzymatching\".\n\nAm i missing something or fuzzy matching algorithm in VS Code doesn't recognize camel case and middle letters while typing? If so, why?\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14151","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14151/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14151/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14151/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14151","id":184449856,"number":14151,"title":"Code -

Use your favorite method to _crash_ Code in such a way that the `%APPDATA%\\Code - Insiders\\Backups\\workspaces.json` file doesn't get updated; hard resetting your machine works best! :)\n5.

Edit the contents of the `workspaces.json` file to point to an inexistent directory, like:\n`{\"folderWorkspaces\":{\"c:\\\\foo\\\\bar\\\\baz\":[]}}`\n3.

However you are passing in the `etag` and the encoding of the file model into the `resolveContent` method of the backup. This is problematic for two reasons:\n- the `etag` is used to find out if the file has been modified since but you take the wrong `etag` (from the file, not the backup)\n- the encoding of the file model can be UTF-16 but I think all backups are stored as UTF-8?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4641","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"8F15:2B9C:6E62BD:119A1EC:59D94005","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=722>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=720>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"7b0a66b497ee6c1b43d14ffe9ee4fbd0\"","status":"200 OK"}}
