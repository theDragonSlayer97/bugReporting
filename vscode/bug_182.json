[CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vector-of-bool.cmake-tools) provides a command `CMake: Quick Start` which creates a stub project with a single CMakeLists.txt file and a \"Hello, World\" level main.cpp. This is great way to skip some of the boilerplate associated by just getting a text editor with a compiler hooked up to it locally. (Something like godbolt, but locally, just to test something or get going on a new project.)\r\n\r\n[Windows Template Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WASTeamAccount.WindowsTemplateStudio) is awesome and it were nice if a similar API could come integrated into VS Code where extensions could register their own quick start templates, or even more convoluted ones, as found in WTS.\r\n\r\nIf such a feature existed, I would gladly take the time and contribute to CMake Tools to create composable CMake script stubs. Something like:\r\n\r\nI need a library that will:\r\n- depend on clFFT and clBLAS\r\n- have unit tests\r\n- have docs created by doxygen\r\n\r\nPlus I will need an executable:\r\n- that links to the library\r\n- which depends on Boost program options\r\n- have docs created by doxygen\r\n\r\nSo something similar to WTS, but for CMake and baked into VS Code for seamless integration. Because this feature I believe is of general interest, it could be worth the effort to create an API for.\r\n\r\nIdeas?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30340/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30339","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30339/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30339/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30339/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30339","id":241741115,"number":30339,"title":"Wrong syntax highlighting for JavaScript with inline php code returning JavaScript objects","user":{"login":"amadeann","id":14104292,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14104292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amadeann","html_url":"https://github.com/amadeann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amadeann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amadeann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amadeann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amadeann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amadeann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amadeann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amadeann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amadeann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amadeann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":293382067,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/php","name":"php","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-10T14:54:03Z","updated_at":"2017-07-10T23:09:41Z","closed_at":"2017-07-10T23:09:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a feature already that I just can't seem to find, but I'd like to make a feature request if it isn't. When searching for a keyword across all files in my project, I would like to be able to clear the search field to stop a search. Currently, if I search for a keyword that might have a lot of results, I don't see any UI element to stop the search and I workaround this by just typing in some gibberish string in place of what I was originally searching for. I find that if I don't clear a search out, it slows down VS Code quite a bit, so it would be nice to be able to stop that. \r\n\r\nMy proposed solution would be adding an 'X' button on the right side of the search field to allow for easy search term clearing. \r\n\r\nThanks for hearing me out and I appreciate this product!

Try to run the `Tests` configuration in VSCode\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote: this is not the only configuration we've tried. Even setting inline source maps doesn't seem to do anything:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ node --version\r\nv8.1.2\r\n$ npm --version\r\n5.0.3\r\n$ yarn --version\r\n0.27.5\r\n$ tsc --version\r\nVersion 2.4.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd really appreciate any help I can get debugging this and figuring out how we can run our tests using the debugger. Once you get used to using the VSCode debugger you want to use it for everything!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30332/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4370","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"D316:366F:C3F4B3:17E1411:59D93443","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=183>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=181>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"e839ea51bb3c6e9a1a5cac8988d36f62\"","status":"200 OK"}}
