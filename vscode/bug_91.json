So, if I run vscode inside a docker container and user configurations are to be persistent, I need to mount the `--user-data-dir` folder into an user disk like `D:\\`. This is fine in mac and linux, but not in windows using docker for windows. Example: \r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ docker run -i -t -v /d/vscode/config:/root/.vscode ninrod/vscode:latest bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nSadly, I cannot do this because `/d/vscode/config` is a NTFS filesystem structure which does not understand unix sockets so `vscode` crashes on startup. \r\n\r\nPlease, allow the user to tell vscode to create these sockets that are created on `--user-data-dir` elsewhere. Example: `/var/run/vscode` or something:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n.vscode $ w\r\n ~/.vscode at root@container using -zsh $\r\n.vscode $ l *.sock\r\nsrwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Aug 24 14:16 1.14.2-main.sock\r\nsrwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Aug 24 14:16 1.14.2-shared.sock\r\n.vscode $\r\n```\r\n\r\nthanks in
