VSCode Version: 1.3.0-insider, 1.2.1\n- OS: Windows 10 Professional x64\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Install a nightly build of typescript supporting `baseUrl` and `paths`, anything since march should do.\n2. Set `\"typescript.tsdk\": \"C:/Users/user/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules/typescript/lib\"`\n3. Changes to paths and baseUrl are not reflected without reloading VSCode.\n\nThis is very frustrating as I am trying to determine a package install strategy which supports multi-versioned, non ambient external module resolution for jspm and I need to test changes manually. Each time I tweak any _tsconfig_ i must reload VSCode.\n\nI was going to raise this issue with the TypeScript team but I have not been able to reproduce it in other editors, such as the VS 15 preview 2, which I have configured to use the new language service and supports these settings. I could not find any exact duplicates.\n\nPS: Thank you for all the hard work you have put into VSCode, it keeps getting better and better :heart:
