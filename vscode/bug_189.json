In the example I have a sample elixir project open in the window being recorded. On the other monitor I have a node project open and I am viewing autossr.js. Notice how the .ex file will flash as my mouse moves from monitor 1 to monitor 2. You will also notice the the filename tab will change from conn.ex to autossr.js. \r\n\r\nI created a .gif to show what I am talking about.

(I suggest a similar window to About Firefox, even open still allows in browser.)\r\n2 - If the automatic updates are disabled, it should inform you that there is a new version with a button to 'Update'.\r\nIf it is automatic the same should indicate a percentage (with a progress bar) or estimated time to download along with the speed we are downloading.\r\n3 - If the download is happening without the window being opened or closed, in the icon of the gear where a blue notification appears, could have in the same position the following animation showing how much progress has been made.\r\n\r\n![progress](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19866231/27874360-a383a158-6185-11e7-8854-4296134d3072.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the extensions I suggest (whether automatic or not.):\r\n\r\n1- Have the following animation, but changing for the existing cores.\r\nIn this case I would follow the same layout (two colors) of this gif. As soon as you clicked to install / update\r\nUp to 50% of the bar corresponds to the download, that is to say 'Downloading'. Already the other 50% would be the installation, ie it would be written 'Installing'.\r\nThe first 50% corresponds to 100% of the download and the other 50% corresponds to 100% of the installation.\r\n\r\n![progress2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19866231/27874373-ad33e7bc-6185-11e7-8b13-ba2d4582c5a9.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2- If the download is automatically happening in the icon of the extension where a blue notification appears, it could have in the same position the following animation showing how much has been progressed, of the total extensions that have to update.\r\n\r\n![progress](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19866231/27874382-b136ef3a-6185-11e7-874f-df84ea8e87c9.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther suggestions are welcome !!

Without realising, one of my connections dropped out. I went to do a search across the project through VS code and got the error:\r\n\"spawn ENXIO\"\r\n\r\nI expected more of a message such as \"Failed to search as the project can no longer be found\" or at least \"Error whilst trying to search\", but got \"spawn ENXIO\" instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSince I used SSHFS, I'll give the steps to reproduce the issue this way.\r\n1. Mount a directory through SSHFS\r\n2. Open said directory as a project\r\n3. Unmount said directory so it's no longer connected through SSHFS and no longer accessible\r\n4. Try to do a search across the project\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot showing the error message and how it appears. I don't know if it's OS specific. I'm using SSHFS from OSXFUSE which I obtained through the Homebrew package manager on macOS\r\n<img width=\"356\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-05 at 15 16 28\"

flash\r\n   * all menus and controls within the editor become unresponsive\r\n- After an interval of between 10 - 30 seconds, the editor picks up where it left off (i.e. 'catches-up' with any typing /copying/pasting, navigation).\r\n- Freeze does not affect any other open application / task-bar / desktop\r\n- Behavior is very frequent (once every 5 minutes or more).\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n- open editor\r\n- open any file\r\n- begin typing, place cursor, copy / paste or navigate\r\n\r\n### Other Information\r\n- Behaviour recent (started since 29 June, 2017)\r\n- Behaviour

of #28602\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo I had a look and i know what's going on and why it's difficult to center this. It's hard because the `.monaco-kbkey` style uses `line-height` to size the background of the button. A negative `margin-top` is used to work around this since the size is fixed to 22px from what I can tell.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"515\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-05 at 2 48 31 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/27859225-e65f7258-612c-11e7-93f0-bc76479233fd.png\">\r\n<img width=\"498\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-05 at 2 48 40 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/27859235-ea5db6ee-612c-11e7-98d2-583e16719ba5.png\">\r\n<img width=\"498\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-05 at 2 48 48 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/27859237-ec2761e6-612c-11e7-9548-0c34bd5b9604.png\">\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere is one remaining issue however, this PR fixes the alignment of all items except for those containing a separator which is 1px off:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"502\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-05 at 2 52 32 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/27859261-037ee026-612d-11e7-904b-18895d09869e.png\">\r\n<img width=\"521\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-05 at 2 52 49 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/27859280-1182b60c-612d-11e7-8392-7a7a30e59539.png\">\r\n\r\nThe reason this is off is because the size of `.results-group-separator` is 23px but its parent `.monaco-tree-row` is set to `22px`, meaning the last pixel is being hidden via `overflow:hidden`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"514\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-05 at 2 54 15 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/27859328-41494b12-612d-11e7-93a8-a45a3234195b.png\">\r\n\r\nThe right fix here is to move the `.results-group-separator` class up one level to the `.monaco-tree-row` level and adjust it's height to 23px. Setting it manually in devtools to 23px seems to work just right:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"525\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-05 at 2 56 22 am\"
