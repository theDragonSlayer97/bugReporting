a convention in Clojure to use macros whose name starts with `def` to define something. Libraries often define their own custom macros for this:\r\n\r\n- `defroutes` (Compojure)\r\n- `defc` (Rum)\r\n- etc\r\n\r\nThis is why whitelisting only def macros from clojure.core isn’t working: it will detect standard vars and functions but will fail to detect custom `def*`-like macros.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds regular expression that treats all forms whose name starts with `def` (with optional namespace) similarly.\r\n\r\nThis convention is very well established so it shouldn’t hurt anyone.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25545","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25545/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25545/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25545/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25545","id":224771847,"number":25545,"title":"Hi
