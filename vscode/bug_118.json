For some reason it's not documented in the [syntax profile options](https://docs.emmet.io/customization/syntax-profiles/#create-your-own-profile), but in the code the functionality [seems to also rely on a `compact_bool` flag being set on the profile](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet/blob/328812c879b56104b7c2bf580d79650a7c20f05b/lib/assets/profile.js#L153), which [should be `true` by default for HTML](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet/blob/328812c879b56104b7c2bf580d79650a7c20f05b/lib/assets/profile.js#L187), and [`false` by default for other profiles](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet/blob/328812c879b56104b7c2bf580d79650a7c20f05b/lib/assets/profile.js#L54).\r\n\r\nI can't seem to find a way to make this work in VS Code, it will always use the attribute name as the value.

Observe that the output is `<div contenteditable=\"contenteditable\"></div>` or `<div whatever=\"whatever\"></div>`\r\n3.

Update\r\n\r\nThis is just a suggestion. \r\n\r\nAlmost all IDEs allow us to set a 'Single Instance Only' option, When this option is true, And you try to run a task that is already running, It'll kill the running task and then restart it.\r\n\r\nVS Code gives an error stating that the task is already running, go to F1->Terminate Task to terminate the task.\r\nThis gets really annoying on some machines where to access Function keys, You also need to hold down a separate  \"Fn\" key. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to let people specify a `SingleInstanceOnly` option in `tasks.json`, If this option is true, then instead of giving an error to user, It should kill the existing task and restart it. \r\nAnd if this option is false, Then just do what it does currently.\r\nDefault value should be `false`, So, Only the people who really need this option can set it and others will see the usual behavior \r\n\r\nAnd, I'd like to work on this, if that's okay. \r\n\r\nRegards
