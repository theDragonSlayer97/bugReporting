VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: Windows 7\n\ncurrently there is the system variable ${workspaceRoot}. This returns the full path to the workspace root so if your open folder is:\n\nc:\\folder1\\folder2 then that is what ${workspaceRoot} returns.\n\nthat is fine if you want the full path returned but if you are developing a website and want to use tasks to intiate running the open file in a browser on local webserver, then you don't want the full path returned. You want the website root foldername returned so in above example you want just the foldername returned which would be \"folder2\". This has the benefit of greatly simplifying building a url to run in browser without resorting to coding.\nFor example you could build a url as \n\n${workspaceRootFolderName}/${relativeFile}\n\nand pass that to your web browser with a task or key definition.\n\ncurrently you would need to strip the foldername from ${workspaceRoot} and you can't do that in tasks.json file.\n\nSo please, please could we have an additional system variable with just the workspaceRoot folder name in it ( NOT the full path to it.)\n\nI'm suggesting calling it ${workspaceRootFolderName}\n\n(unless there is already some system variable I don't know about which could be used without needing to edit it).\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11093","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11093/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11093/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11093/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/11093","id":173746767,"number":11093,"title":"Changes

for #10574:\ncomplexity: 4\n- [x] Windows - **@ramya-rao-a**\n- [x] OS X - **@sandy081**\n- [x] Linux - **@rebornix**\n\nIn this milestone it is now possible to launch the node debug target in the 'integrated terminal' which helps when developing node.js-based command line applications that read from input and/or need to control the terminal they are running in.\n\nSince there are now three options where to run a node program (debug console, integrated terminal, external terminal), we've deprecated the launch.json boolean attribute `externalConsole` and introduced a new attribute `console` which accepts the following values: `internalConsole`, `integratedTerminal`, `externalTerminal`.\n\nPlease verify:\n- launching the debug target in the integrated terminal works. Make sure that passing arguments, environment variables, and 'cwd' work even if the values include spaces or quotes.\n- the other two `console` options `internalConsole` and `externalConsole` continue to work.\n- the new attribute `console` shows up in hover help and  newly created launch.json uses it instead of the deprecated `externalConsole`.\n- the old `externalConsole` options still works if no `console` option is specified.\n\nPlease note:\nThe problem that every debug session creates a new terminal is already tracked here:

instead of getting errors relative to the lines (i.e. line 5, position 14),  you get errors relative to the absolute position of the character in the entire file.

Currently there is no way to know that in Visual Studio Code.\n\nThe only information displayed in the bottom bar is the Row and Column. So I can know the character at a certain position in a line, but I don't know what is the absolute character number (including hidden formatting characters like new line, eof, etc).\n\nIt would be awesome to be able to see instead of this:\n\n> row 1, col 5\n\nThis:\n\n> row 1, col 5, chr 116\n\nIt should also be useful to be able to programmatically move the cursor to a new position using the absolute position of the character instead of the line, column coordinates. So that instead of being able to do just this:\n\n> var newPosition = position.with(position.line, 5);\n\nYou would be also able to do this:\n\n> var newPosition = position.with(116);\n\nIn this way when a compiler log will give you an absolute character number position for an error in you file, your code extension can immediately position the cursor in that exact place, hilighting the right character that rised the exception.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11086/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11085","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11085/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11085/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11085/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11085","id":173710908,"number":11085,"title":"Char array should be shown as string, not as nornal array","user":{"login":"PatrickChen83","id":5383244,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5383244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickChen83","html_url":"https://github.com/PatrickChen83","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickChen83/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickChen83/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickChen83/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickChen83/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickChen83/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickChen83/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickChen83/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickChen83/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickChen83/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-29T07:14:26Z","updated_at":"2016-08-29T13:21:05Z","closed_at":"2016-08-29T13:21:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.3.1\n- OS Version: Linux 4.7.1\n\nAs title, character array is shown as a normal array everywhere, which can be annoying when watching on a very long string.\n\n![normal array](http://imgur.com/rTOwqeH.jpg)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
