But when the lines contain for example (javascript) template strings where indenting is very important, increasing indenting is not possible (or you'll have to change the code to string[] joining).\r\nThis can be quite a pain when dealing with large sections of template strings that aren't collapsed (such as in the image below).\r\n\r\nA possible solution except for of course collapsing everything inside a collapsed block, would be to make it possible to collapse a multi-line template string by itself.\r\n\r\n![large example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5385012/31254886-c4ac41b2-aa2a-11e7-948b-8f84807dc54c.gif)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35652","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35652/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35652/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35652/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35652","id":263281799,"number":35652,"title":"extensions connect ENOENT error MacOS since 1.14","user":{"login":"tgill880","id":18023059,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18023059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgill880","html_url":"https://github.com/tgill880","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgill880/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgill880/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgill880/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgill880/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgill880/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgill880/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgill880/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgill880/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgill880/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-10-05T22:08:23Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T16:31:29Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Selecting the Extensions icon in the left tool bar results in the following error message:\r\n\r\n`connect ENOENT /var/folders/my/t5b899fn0_s4tx5_tndwnvh00000gp/C/Code-1.16.1-shared.sock`\r\n\r\nOf course, no extensions are then listed.\r\n\r\nThis error occurs with 1.16.1, 1.15.1 and 1.14.2, but **not** with 1.13.

Create task (using the 2.0.0. compatibility version) and run \"server\" command which will run corresponding script with node and tsc processes.  \r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n    \"type\": \"process\",\r\n    \"tasks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"npm\",\r\n            \"script\": \"server\",\r\n            \"problemMatcher\": [],\r\n            \"isBackground\": true,\r\n            \"promptOnClose\": true,\r\n            \"presentation\": {\r\n                \"echo\": true,\r\n                \"reveal\": \"always\",\r\n                \"focus\": false,\r\n                \"panel\": \"new\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n3.

The command is successfully ran and on the exit, editor ask I you wish to terminate running task. If you choose Yes, all node instances and tsc in the \"watch\" state are successfully terminated. \r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n    \"isShellCommand\": false,\r\n    \"showOutput\":
