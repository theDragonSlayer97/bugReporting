It would be great to switch to only a single window at a time; if you move your mouse to the top of the window then the line of tabs should drop down, just as the dropdown menu does when you're in full-screen mode. I imagine that it would be most accommodating to all users to enable hiding of the line of tabs as an option, as opposed to the default.

VSCode Version: 1.8.0\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n\r\nThis problem looks like it would be eslint but when running eslint from the command line it doesn't return any errors but eslint in vscode does.  I think the 1.8.0 update broke how it handles override rules from extend.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.  Create a `.eslintrc.js` file with the following code: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    \"env\": {\r\n        \"browser\": true\r\n    },\r\n    \"extends\": \"airbnb\",\r\n    \"plugins\": [\r\n        \"react\",\r\n        \"jsx-a11y\",\r\n        \"import\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"parser\": \"babel-eslint\",\r\n    \"rules\": {\r\n        \"indent\": [\"error\", 4, {\r\n            SwitchCase: 1\r\n        }],\r\n        \"arrow-body-style\": [\"off\"],\r\n\r\n        \"no-underscore-dangle\": [\"error\", { allowAfterThis: true, allow: [\"_source\"]}],\r\n        \"no-empty\": [\"error\", { \"allowEmptyCatch\": true }],\r\n        \"no-plusplus\": [\"error\", { \"allowForLoopAfterthoughts\": true }],\r\n        \"no-unused-expressions\": [\"error\", { \"allowShortCircuit\": true }],\r\n        \"import/no-named-as-default\": [\"off\"],\r\n        \"import/prefer-default-export\": [\"off\"],\r\n    },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich requires the follow from your package.json\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n   // .... name and stuff\r\n  devDependencies: {\r\n    \"babel-eslint\": \"^7.1.1\",\r\n    \"eslint\": \"^3.11.1\",\r\n    \"eslint-config-airbnb\": \"^13.0.0\",\r\n    \"eslint-plugin-import\": \"2.1.0\",\r\n    \"eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y\": \"2.2.3\",\r\n    \"eslint-plugin-react\": \"6.6.0\",\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Then run eslint over the following code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\n// constants/users.js\r\nexport const LOGIN_USER = 'LOGIN_USER';\r\n\r\n// actions/users.js\r\nimport UserConstants from '../constants/users';\r\n\r\nexport const SuccessfulUserLogin = (response) => {\r\n    return {\r\n        type: UserConstants.LOGIN_USER,\r\n        response,\r\n    };\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will see that it's listening to the rules that come with eslint (not plugins) but the import plugin rules it's throwing an error on line 5 of `actions/users.js` on `UserConstants` variable: \r\n\r\n```\r\nseverity: 'Error'\r\nmessage: 'Caution: `UserConstants` also has a named export `LOGIN_USER`. Check if you meant to write `import {LOGIN_USER} from '../constants/users'` instead. (import/no-named-as-default-member)'\r\nat: '5,15'\r\nsource: 'eslint'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you were to run `./node_modules/.bin/eslint actions/users.js` you would not get that error but you do get it in vscode.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there's any more information I can provide for you, I'm loving vscode.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17196","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17196/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17196/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17196/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17196","id":195653868,"number":17196,"title":"1.8

Now there are light, single pixel lines dividing each tab.  I can only see them with strain.\r\n(2) There used to be a dark, single pixel line at the bottom of the tab bar dividing it from the editor, in addition to a subtle drop shadow.  Now the drop shadow is the only visible division.  The shadow-only division makes the line between the non-active (gray) tabs and the editor contents just look like a blur.  I find my eyes straining significantly.\r\n(3) I'm not sure, but it feels like the rendering of the text in the tab bar might be a little blurrier; however this likely not the case--it might just be the eye strain/blur from (1), (2) that gives this impression.\r\n\r\nBy my eye, it seems that the dark themes might have improved (not sure; don't use them typically).  Nonetheless, the light theme seems to have regressed enough to steer me (reluctantly) towards the dark themes.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has a 1.7 light+ screenshot handy, please post for comparison.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17195","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17195/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17195/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17195/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17195","id":195650002,"number":17195,"title":"Keypair settings misaligned with dictionary settings when using Copy to Settings","user":{"login":"jamisonbryant","id":6774110,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6774110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamisonbryant","html_url":"https://github.com/jamisonbryant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamisonbryant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamisonbryant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamisonbryant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamisonbryant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamisonbryant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamisonbryant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamisonbryant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamisonbryant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamisonbryant/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":479204519,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/config","name":"config","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":293417806,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/json","name":"json","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-12-14T21:25:46Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T13:12:10Z","closed_at":"2017-01-25T16:34:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.8.0\r\n- OS Version: Win10 64-bit Bld. 1607\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
