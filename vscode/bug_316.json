The bug happened during last milestone because the way we dispose resources changed.\r\n\r\nPreviously:\r\n* close an editor\r\n* persist view state from the editor model\r\n* dispose editor model\r\n\r\nNow:\r\n* close an editor\r\n* dispose editor model\r\n* persist view state from editor model\r\n=> since the model is disposed, the view state is undefined\r\n\r\nMy fix introduces a new event `onWillCloseEditor` directly on the stacks model which the text file editor can use to persist the view state right before the model goes away. On top of that we also only persist the view state when the input is not disposed, because otherwise we still hit the current issue that we try to persist the view state of a disposed model.\r\n\r\n@Tyriar can you check the code and let me know what you think? If you guys want to move ahead and release recovery today, feel free to merge. Otherwise I can do it tomorrow.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26321","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26321/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26321/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26321/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26321","id":227422805,"number":26321,"title":"Ask to replace dirty file when opening it again explicitly","user":{"login":"lgmorand","id":6757079,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6757079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgmorand","html_url":"https://github.com/lgmorand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgmorand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgmorand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgmorand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgmorand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgmorand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgmorand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgmorand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgmorand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgmorand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":301327312,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/explorer-files","name":"explorer-files","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-05-09T16:23:35Z","updated_at":"2017-05-10T05:03:00Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.12.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. put a file in a folder\r\n2. open it with right click -> open with VSCode\r\n3. in VS code, just modify the file\r\n4. in the explorer, update the content of the file (i.e. a log file)\r\n5. open it with right click -> open with VSCode\r\n6.

The bug happened during last milestone because the way we dispose resources changed.\r\n\r\nPreviously:\r\n* close an editor\r\n* persist view state from the editor model\r\n* dispose editor model\r\n\r\nNow:\r\n* close an editor\r\n* dispose editor model\r\n* persist view state from editor model\r\n=> since the model is disposed, the view state is undefined\r\n\r\nMy fix introduces a new event `onWillCloseEditor` directly on the stacks model which the text file editor can use to persist the view state right before the model goes away. On top of that we also only persist the view state when the input is not disposed, because otherwise we still hit the current issue that we try to persist the view state of a disposed model.\r\n\r\n@Tyriar can you check the code and let me know what you think? If you guys want to move ahead and release recovery today, feel free to merge. Otherwise I can do it tomorrow.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26318","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26318/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26318/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26318/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26318","id":227410152,"number":26318,"title":"Linux:

If the value of `protocol` is changed to `legacy`, the values for `runtimeArgs` and `port` must be changed as well, otherwise a problematic inconsistency will occur.\r\n\r\nIt would be preferable if we could just use this:\r\n```json\r\n\"protocol\": \"inspector\",\r\n\"runtimeExecutable\": \"nodemon\",\r\n\"restart\": true,    \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case the debug adapter picks a random port and passes it with the correct 'inspect' or 'debug' option to the runtime.\r\n\r\nThe problem is how this \"port\" can be looped from the DA back to VS Code and then to the next session. \r\n\r\nI suggest that we support a generic mechanism for passing arbitrary data from one debug session to the next by extending the type of the `restart`attribute of the `TerminatedRequest` from \"boolean\" to \"any\".\r\n\r\nVS Code will loop this `restart` value unmodified and uninterpreted from one session to a restarted next session as the (already existing) `__restart` attribute of the `launchRequest`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26314","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26314/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26314/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26314/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26314","id":227381662,"number":26314,"title":"Refactor when moving files","user":{"login":"claudius25","id":27408127,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/27408127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudius25","html_url":"https://github.com/claudius25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudius25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudius25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudius25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudius25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudius25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudius25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudius25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudius25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudius25/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-09T14:15:30Z","updated_at":"2017-05-20T15:11:41Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"The best feature you could have is to refactor when moving files in the explorer (out of the box) \r\nThere is a extension (move ts) but it's buggy. \r\nIt's a basic refactor thing, which to my surprise is not in visual code. \r\n\r\nSo if i move a file from a folder to another, i want it's path reference to be updated automatically in the project.
