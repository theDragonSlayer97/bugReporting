now Shift-Alt-Select is almost a useful feature. The only issue is that you have to click at the start of your selection then input the Unnecessarily long hotkey of Shift-Alt to then click once somewhere else that you want to edit.\r\n\r\nThe way this feature was implemented feels like a hack because you don't have control over selections or mouse drags or something, But can you please go in and re do this feature. Its the only thing holding VS code back from being a good program that I can recommend and use every day.\r\n\r\nRight now the tradeoff is should you go with the program that is slick and sleek at the expense of losing an essential quality of life feature that I've had since I first learned java on Notepad++ a decade ago and that basically every single other code editor has.

Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode. -->\r\n## System Information:\r\n<!-- Use Help > Report Issues to prefill these. -->\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.15.1\r\n- OS Version: Debian 9.1 (Stretch)\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\n - Reproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\n**Note:** I've attempted to reproduce this issue on Windows, but have been unable to do so, I'm not sure if it's because executing the command takes longer on Windows or if its because the issue simply isn't present on Windows.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new workspace\r\n1. Create a tasks.json with the following contents (note that it's version 2.0.0)\r\n\t```\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t// See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\r\n\t\t// for the documentation about the tasks.json format\r\n\t\t\"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n\t\t\"tasks\": [\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\"taskName\": \"test\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"shell\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"command\": \"echo hello world; sleep 1\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"group\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"kind\": \"test\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"isDefault\": true\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t]\r\n\t}\r\n\t```\r\n1. Run the test test several times, note how the terminal remains visible after the task has completed, and contains the following message: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5873790/30079779-550467f6-924f-11e7-9531-64892f51878b.png)\r\n1. Remove the sleep portion of the command so that the command line of tasks.json reads as follows:\r\n`\"command\": \"echo hello world\"`\r\n1. Run the test task several times, note that if you still had the terminal open from the previous step, that it gets automatically closed after the task completes. The terminal re-opens every time the new version of the command is run, and is automatically closed afterwards. The following is all that is printed (note that the \"Terminal will be reused by tasks, press any key to close it\" message is not displayed)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5873790/30079964-0cba22b4-9250-11e7-931e-7f90ab6d62c3.png)\r\n\r\n## Additional Info\r\nThis is actually a combination of two parts of the same issue, the first being that in tasks.json version 2.0.0 a task which terminates too quickly will automatically clear and close the tasks output terminal. In tasks.json version 0.1.0, the expected behavior (of the task output terminal remaining open) occurs regardless of whether or not the task completes extremely quickly.\r\n\r\nI have also included a [zip archive](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/1278719/example.zip) containing two versions of an example workspaces where this problem is present; the workspaces contain the source code for a basic \"Hello World\" program, a makefile to build it, and the appropriate tasks.json. The `tasks-new` workspace uses tasks.json version 2.0.0 whereas 'tasks-legacy' uses tasks.json version 0.1.0. The behavior I've experienced in these workspaces is as follows:\r\n\r\n| Workspace \t| Build Command (In a clean workspace) \t| Build Command (When the program has already been compiled) \t| Test Command \t| Test Command (When the example program has been built with the sleep(1) line enabled) \t|\r\n|--------------\t|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| tasks-legacy \t| Build output is displayed, the terminal remains open \t| \"make: Nothing to be done for 'build'.\" is displayed, the terminal remains open \t| \"[0] './bin/a.out'\" is displayed, the terminal remains open \t| \"[0] './bin/a.out'\" is displayed, the terminal remains open \t|\r\n| tasks-new \t| Build output is displayed, the terminal remains open, \"Terminal will be reused by tasks, press any key to close it.\" message is displayed \t| \"make: Nothing to be done for 'build'.\" is displayed, the terminal is closed when the task completes \t| \"[0] './bin/a.out'\" is displayed, the terminal is closed when the task completes \t| \"[0] './bin/a.out'\" is displayed, the terminal remains open, \"Terminal will be reused by tasks, press any key to close it.\" message is displayed
