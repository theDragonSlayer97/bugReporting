if this is the wrong place to ask for this.\n\nIt is really awesome that VS Code is now open-source. Some time ago I created a issue in the TypeScript repo (https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/5324) asking if it'd be possible to embed the Monaco Editor (as used in the [TypeScript Playground](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground)) into your own HTML pages.\n\nI'd like to:\n- Show the Monaco editor in the HTML page using the Typescript Language Service.\n- Specify the initial TypeScript editor contents and my own .d.ts definition files to be used by the TS Language Service.\n- Get the displayed TypeScript and the transpiled Javascript when e.g. a button is clicked.\n- Be able to dispose of the editor when e.g. another button is clicked.\n\nSo I'd like to use the editor similar to the Typescript Playground, with the difference that I would specify my own .d.ts files and to not have a JavaScript editor at the right-hand side.\nHowever I don't know how to do this correctly.\n\nI checked out the vscode repository and invoked tsc in the [src folder](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/src). Then I created a HTML page in that folder using the TS playground as a template:\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n<h1>Test Monaco</h1>\n\n<div id=\"typescriptEditor\"></div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        var require = {\n            baseUrl: \"/\"\n        };\n</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"vs/loader.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"vs/editor/editor.main.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\nif (!window.console.info) {\n    window.console.info = function(){}\n}\n\n(function () {\n    'use strict';\n\n    var domnode = document.getElementById('typescriptEditor')\n    var typescriptMode = null;\n\n    require(['vs/editor/editor.main'], function () {\n\n        Monaco.Editor.getOrCreateMode('text/typescript').then(function (mode) {\n            typescriptMode = mode;\n\n            var editor = Monaco.Editor.create(domnode, {\n                value: '',\n                mode: 'text/plain',\n                fontIsMonospace: true,\n                suggestOnTriggerCharacters: true,\n                showTypeScriptWarnings: false\n            });\n        });\n\n\n    });\n\n})();\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nHowever, when hosting the directory in IIS Express and opening the HTML file in a browser, I'm getting errors such as\n\n```\nGET \nhttp://localhost:8080/vs/editor/contrib/comment/common/color.css [HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found 16ms]\nGET \nhttp://localhost:8080/vs/editor/contrib/inPlaceReplace/common/gotoError.css [HTTP/1.1 404 Not

give me some pointers how to embed the editor correctly using the TS service?\n\nThank
