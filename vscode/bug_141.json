Both folders have `vscode.d.ts` and while I surely have opened both files at least once, I have opened `vscode.d.ts` from the vscode-sources at least 1000-times more often (and more recent). Still, the file picker presents the `vscode.d.ts` from the extension on top, always. It seems like I once made a mistake to open the wrong vscode.d.ts-file and I am still being punished for that. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"944\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-27 at 17 12 07\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1794099/28677856-12e45cd4-72ef-11e7-8806-8dc37eda1a11.png\">\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31591/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31590","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31590/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31590/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31590/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31590","id":246067917,"number":31590,"title":"How do I handle type assertion in vanilla Javascript when using checkJs?","user":{"login":"thw0rted","id":943160,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/943160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thw0rted","html_url":"https://github.com/thw0rted","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thw0rted/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thw0rted/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thw0rted/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thw0rted/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thw0rted/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thw0rted/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thw0rted/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thw0rted/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thw0rted/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-27T14:56:17Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T15:44:56Z","closed_at":"2017-07-27T15:44:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.14.2 (cb82febafda0c8c199b9201ad274e25d9a76874e, 2017-07-19T23:26:08.116Z)\r\n- OS Version: Linux x64 4.10.0-27-generic\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've [asked the same question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45353770/how-do-i-convince-the-typescript-checker-that-a-value-is-a-specific-subclass-in) but I'm rephrasing it here.

is a new editor action that greatly improves one of my most common workflows, and that I think may be encountered by other people using VS Code with settings similar to my own.\r\n\r\n**Scenario:**\r\n\r\nI always have VS Code configured with `\"workbench.editor.enablePreview\": false`, because I find that I generally want files to be kept open after navigating to them and there is less friction when I don't have to remember to double-click. The tradeoff is that when prepping my changes for commit, all of the diff viewers will remain open as well.\r\n\r\n**Proposal:**\r\n\r\nAdd a \"Close All Diff Editors\" command to the relevant context menus, so that the user can get rid of all the diff views in one shot once they've finished using them, but still leave all their code editors open to continue working. This is especially useful for anyone that likes to make lots of bite-sized local commits.\r\n\r\nThis is implemented in the service-layer as a more generic \"close everything of a specified type\", but the only action wired up to it currently is for diff views.\r\n\r\n**Demo:**\r\n\r\n![close-diff-editors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1147216/28673626-047b8516-72b1-11e7-8ed1-4d8b676cd957.gif)\r\n
