ES3-style classes, specified using a constructor function and assignments to the prototype property. CommonJS-style module patterns, specified as property assignments on the exports object, or assignments to the module.exports property.\n\nIt seems in my experiments, the intellisense does not work in the case of commonjs modules being loaded from node_modules.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n- mkdir vscode-test\n- cd vscode-test/\n- code .\n- create jsconfig.json\n\n```\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"ES6\"\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nAccording to the docs,  this jsconfig.json file is implicitly saying that the JS project context should be all files beneath the vscode-test directory.\n- create test.js\n\n```\nvar lodash = require('lodash');\nconsole.log(lodash);\n```\n- npm install lodash \n- vscode `cmd-> reload javascript project`\n- `node test.js`  to confirm the module is being loaded\n- hover over var lodash in test.js, and see it has no type inference and no intellisense.\n\nlodash is perhaps not the best example, because there are definite typings available for lodash, and it would be more expedient to just do like:`typings install lodash`-- problem solved. However there are lots of other javascript modules that don't have typings. For example:\n\n`npm install tnt.tree` (tnt.tree part of the biojs suite of modules). This is the one where I first noticed this problem.\n\nAlso realize in practice, one normally add node_modules to the exclude list in jsconfig.json. In summary there seems to be no way to get the type inference and intellisense working on (selected) js libraries installed via npm into node_modules.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8026","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8026/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8026/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8026/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8026","id":161803659,"number":8026,"title":"Suggestion:

After this \"ext install\" says \"No results found\" even if I try extensions I know should work (\"ext install c++\", \"ext install cmake\"). \n\nI noticed this by luck on one Mac earlier this morning.

The cursors work fine but the menu pops up as well.\n\nIt would be nice if code can not show the menu on alt press if one or more cursors were placed on the screen while the key was down. Since the menu only pops up on keyup, I reckon this should be possible.
