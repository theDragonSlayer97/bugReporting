VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.16.0-insider (b73b7df1290d0fe66ca8b8060743711a327af622, 2017-08-14T05:16:07.578Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.16257\r\n---\r\n\r\nCurrently it is difficult to \"simulate\" the changing of an icon of a command. Since the api doesn't allow changing the icon directly, it has to be simulated by using extra commands and contexts.\r\n\r\nFor example, in GitLens I've recently added a new \"feature\" to show a sort of progress indicator on the `gitlens.toggleFileBlame` command while I am computing the blame annotations (the icon pulses), and then once completed I change the blame icon to be in an \"on\" state to indicate that the blame is active (the icon turns orange).\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this I have to create 3 commands, the original `gitlens.toggleFileBlame` command for the `off` state, `gitlens.computingFileAnnotations` command which is a no-op for the `progress` state, and `gitlens.clearFileAnnotations` for the `on` state. You can see definition of 3 commands [here](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens/blob/00cdd2e375e77c5cf5339d84c0287be30a80971b/package.json#L812-L838). And the usage of those commands can be seen [here](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens/blob/00cdd2e375e77c5cf5339d84c0287be30a80971b/package.json#L1253-L1268)\r\n\r\nInstead of having 3 command for this, I would much rather have been able to have a single command:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"command\": \"gitlens.toggleFileBlame\",\r\n    \"title\": \"Toggle File Blame Annotations\",\r\n    \"category\": \"GitLens\",\r\n    \"icon\": {\r\n        \"dark\": \"images/dark/git-icon.svg\",\r\n        \"light\": \"images/light/git-icon.svg\",\r\n        \"when\": !gitlens:annotationStatus\r\n    },\r\n    \"icon\": {\r\n        \"dark\": \"images/dark/git-icon-progress.svg\",\r\n        \"light\": \"images/light/git-icon-progress.svg\",\r\n        \"when\": gitlens:annotationStatus == computing\r\n    },\r\n    \"icon\": {\r\n        \"dark\": \"images/dark/git-icon-orange.svg\",\r\n        \"light\": \"images/light/git-icon-orange.svg\",\r\n        \"when\": gitlens:annotationStatus == computed\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat way I wouldn't need to switch the commands out in each menu (currently I'm being lazy and only doing it on the editor/title navigation), the keyboard shortcuts show up as expect, and I don't need to register extra commands that I don't actually need.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32525","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32525/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32525/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32525/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32525","id":250230629,"number":32525,"title":"Missing the canvas tag.

Open a (typescript) file like:\r\n\r\n    ```ts\r\n    let test: string[] = [\r\n\r\n        \"a\",\r\n\r\n        \"b\",\r\n\r\n        \"c\"\r\n    ];\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Copy following text\r\n\r\n    ```ts\r\n    ,\r\n\r\n        \"b\",\r\n\r\n        \"c\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. Paste it after `\"c\"`, we will get:\r\n\r\n    ```ts\r\n    const OK_CMDS: string[] = [\r\n\r\n        \"a\",\r\n\r\n        \"b\",\r\n\r\n        \"c\",\r\n        // Here is 4 spaces\r\n            \"b\", // Here is 4 spaces more indentation\r\n        // Here is 4 spaces\r\n            \"c\" // Here is 4 spaces more indentation\r\n    ];\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nAnd before v1.15.0, we should get\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst OK_CMDS: string[] = [\r\n\r\n    \"a\",\r\n\r\n    \"b\",\r\n\r\n    \"c\",\r\n// here is no spaces\r\n    \"b\", // here should be only 4 spaces as indentation\r\n// here is no spaces\r\n    \"c\" // here should be only 4 spaces as indentation\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nI search for **indent** in settings, and found the option `editor.autoIndent`. I set it to `false` and then all behavior is well, as v1.14.x did. Thus I wonder, what does it mean? This option makes VSCode behave so strangely as Eclipse does.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions:
