Update VSCode to **January 2017 build (insiders)**. All previous build is fine.\r\n2. Open \"help\"-->\"Toggle developer tools\"-->inspect different type of rendered code element (for example in javascript - const, let, class, import, function, block, expression ... etc). **Like \"\\<span class=\"token js meta var expr storage type\">const\\</span>\"**.\r\n\r\nBefore january build each peace of code (each \\<div>) in vscode had _special class on rendered element_. There was special class for each type of code element (constants, imports, object literal, keyword, variable, assignment, definition, brace, brace round, storage, punctuation, method, declaration ... ... ....). It system give us (developer and user) _huge possibility to customize our code_ (like extension \"vscode-custom-css\") and make themes for vscode. One of great advantages of vscode - is excellent font rendering.\r\n\r\nThe PROBLEM is now (from january build) all this system is broken. **Instead of huge additional classes we got only  small piece of classes:**\r\n\r\n_.mtk1 { color: #B3B3D4; }\r\n.mtk2 { color: #1D1D26; }\r\n.mtk3 { color: #504E6E; }\r\n.mtk4 { color: #CC66FF; }\r\n.mtk5 { color: #00D364; }\r\n.mtk6 { color: #FF3399; }\r\n.mtk7 { color: #F8F8F0; }\r\n.mtk8 { color: #00BFFF; }\r\n.mtk9 { color: #FFCC66; }\r\n.mtk10 { color: #00CED1; }\r\n.mtki { font-style: italic; }\r\n.mtkb { font-weight: bold; }\r\n.mtku { text-decoration: underline; }_\r\n\r\nand that's all we got now (no all the stuff that I describe before). See attached photo for compare \"before\" and \"after\".\r\n**13 classes instead of about 40 and they combination** :-1: \r\n\r\nI really understand that in this way vscode creators make renders much more faster in the editor....\r\nand some times we will have breaking changes... but you remove all this class system (EXTREMELY REDUCE CUSTOMIZATION POSSIBILITY )\r\n\r\n**PLEASE BRING BACK CLASS SYSTEM !!!** :+1: \r\n\r\n\r\nOld **excellent** \"class system\":\r\n\r\n![before-changes-with-class-system](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14540860/22109568/f9c907a4-de60-11e6-9e20-36590927e056.png)\r\n\r\nNew **poor** classes:\r\n\r\n![after update-no-classes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14540860/22109569/f9ce1af0-de60-11e6-90b4-7760568a03f7.png)\r\n\r\nFeeling like moved _**from IDE**_ (IntelliJ IDEA‎, Visual Studio ....) _**to notepad**_ :-1: \r\n\r\nCode before update (each type of code **properly colorized**) + additional font-family for some type of code.\r\n\r\n![before-update](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14540860/22109076/d65b076a-de5e-11e6-8671-6f8865e79d03.png)\r\n\r\nCode after update (**poor colorization** - half of code in the same color).

I normally use PowerGUI IDE for PowerShell, but want to move over to VS Code.\r\n\r\nA simple but very useful feature in PowerGUI is the ability to see the value and type of any variables once they have been populated. Therefore if you write and execute some simple code like the following\r\n\r\n$A = 10\r\n$B = 1,2,3,4\r\n\r\nonce executed you can hover over the variable in question with your mouse and it will tell you the TYPE and current value/s of the variable.\r\n\r\nI do not see this in VS Code and when using the debugger the variables pane (top left) is blank e.g. it also does not list any variables or their values.\r\n\r\nIt this because the PowerShell extension simply does not support this? \r\n\r\nBeing able to see the current value (if any) of any variables in your script (once executed once) is a must have I would say otherwise it makes it very difficult indeed to debug a script.\r\n\r\nAlso if I set a break-point and start the debugger, the only option I get is to 'stop' the debugger and when I do I receive the following error: Debug adapter process has terminated unexpectedly\r\nagain I do not see the value of any variables.\r\n\r\nPlease advise\r\nThanks in advance\r\nErnestBrant@outlook.com\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18782","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18782/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18782/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18782/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18782","id":201858149,"number":18782,"title":"SignatureHelpProvider

I'm also not sure how to make the action button reflect if the output is locked or not. Perhaps it's possible to use the action `checked` property and style the checked button in the same CSS file where the icon will be referenced, but the issue is that the action is not channel specific (ie there's only one instance of the action per panel, not per channel).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18767","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18767/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18767/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18767/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18767","id":201778820,"number":18767,"title":"Suggest to add new panel for Peek Definition","user":{"login":"xixiliguo","id":17514448,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17514448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixiliguo","html_url":"https://github.com/xixiliguo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixiliguo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixiliguo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixiliguo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixiliguo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixiliguo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixiliguo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixiliguo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixiliguo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xixiliguo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-01-19T06:54:53Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T09:18:24Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
