(see #14745) automatically scrolling / causing the user to lose their place in the file tree is extremely annoying.\r\n2. **Open Editors Panel** - When there are two files close together in the hierarchy, with the same name, it's too easy to accidentally misread the file paths (especially when they're very long) for that to be a satisfactory replacement for the traditional hierarchy.\r\n3. **Keyboard Shortcut** - [keyboard shortcuts](http://stackoverflow.com/a/42493479) are great, but this should be one of those \"don't make me think\" things - not a key combo that has to be pressed hundreds of times/day.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23902/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23901","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23901/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23901/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23901/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23901","id":219370204,"number":23901,"title":"Program Icon","user":{"login":"Camouflage100","id":11241823,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11241823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Camouflage100","html_url":"https://github.com/Camouflage100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Camouflage100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Camouflage100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Camouflage100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Camouflage100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Camouflage100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Camouflage100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Camouflage100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Camouflage100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Camouflage100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-04-04T20:18:11Z","updated_at":"2017-04-11T01:36:38Z","closed_at":"2017-04-11T01:36:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code -

Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 7 Profesionnal, SP1\r\n\r\nHi everyone.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to debug typescript code (or javascript code) in server side with visual studio code, when launching it with nodemon. I've added a new configuration in launch.json which looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n      \"type\": \"node\",\r\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Launch server with Nodemon\",\r\n      \"runtimeExecutable\": \"nodemon\",\r\n      \"runtimeArgs\": [\r\n        \"--debug=5858\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/src/server.ts\",\r\n      \"restart\": true,\r\n      \"port\": 5858,\r\n      \"console\": \"integratedTerminal\",\r\n      \"internalConsoleOptions\": \"neverOpen\",\r\n      \"outFiles\": [\"${workspaceRoot}/build/**/*.js\"]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nI have a task in vscode that is running tsc that builds javascript files properly. This is my current task config:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\r\n  // for the documentation about the tasks.json format\r\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n

generated as expected when I change a typescript file.\r\nAnd the nodejs server is restarting as expected when a javascript file is generated. \r\n\r\nBut I am not able to break on any breakpoint (on typescript files or javascript files).\r\n\r\nCan you tell me please if it is an issue or if there is something I am missing ?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23899","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23899/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23899/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23899/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23899","id":219348462,"number":23899,"title":"COntrol-C
