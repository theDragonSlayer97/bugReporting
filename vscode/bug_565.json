Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.8.1\r\n- OS Version: 1607 build 14393.693\r\n\r\n\r\n- Node Version: 6.5.0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new project with a simple _app.js_ file.\r\n2. Copy snippet below to _app.js_\r\n```\r\n'use strict';\r\nvar x = {first: \"j\", last: \"s\", age: 35};\r\nconsole.assert(x.age == 35);\r\ndelete x.first;\r\nconsole.assert(x.age == 35);\r\ndelete x['last'];\r\nconsole.assert(x.age == 35);\r\ndelete x['notexist'];\r\nconsole.assert(x.age == 35);\r\ndelete x.notexist;\r\nconsole.assert(x.age == 35);\r\n```\r\n3. Make a _launch.json_ configuration with **type:** _node_ or _node2_\r\n4. The file will run and complete without errors.\r\n5. Place a breakpoint in the code on **line 8:** _delete x['notexist'];_\r\n6. Manually type the following code line by line into the **Debug Console**\r\n```\r\ndelete x['notexist'];\r\nx;\r\ndelete x.notexist;\r\nx;\r\n```\r\n7. Match to the output I am recieving:\r\n```\r\ndelete x['notexist'];\r\n\"true\"\r\nx;\r\nObject {age: 35}\r\ndelete x.notexist;\r\nTypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object\r\nx;\r\nundefined\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe behaviour shown is well outside what I would expect. I would expect that under strict mode _delete x['notexist'];_ would return a _TypeError_ and leave object x unchanged. The second operation _delete x.notexist;_ does return the error, but it also sets object x to _undefined_.\r\n\r\n**N.B.** This only occurs under strict mode.\r\n\r\nI have searched for an explanation for this behaviour and can't find one. If it is intentional I would appreciate understanding why.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18824","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18824/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18824/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18824/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/18824","id":202028741,"number":18824,"title":"Support

code 进程，再去看 home,vue 文件内容就变成了 null\r\n\r\n\r\n我把 beautify插件禁用掉，就没问题了，但是就不能格式化代码了。\r\n\r\n我初步怀疑是：按下ctrl+s 后，保存会自动格式化代码，代码变动触发了自动保存，这样进入了死循环。\r\n\r\n但，我把代码自动保存取消了，还是没解决问题。。。。。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18822","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18822/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18822/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18822/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18822","id":202026101,"number":18822,"title":"Port
