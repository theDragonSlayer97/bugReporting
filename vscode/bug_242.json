Copy this file somewhere: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3vgfq34mfzfquxs/strange.txt?dl=0\r\n2. Open integrated console with WSL bash\r\n3. `cat` the file from before\r\n4. Scroll the console\r\n\r\nEffect:\r\n![Image 1](http://g.recordit.co/aACUwGOh29.gif)\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that when you scroll, everything looks OK for a moment, but then, half a second after the scrolling action, some words of some lines will replicate themselves at some position more to the left on the same line. Scrolling again will fix it again for half a second, and then it gets unfixed once more, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt happens outside WSL as well, e.g. with PowerShell (in this example all the border characters are messed up, but that's not the point):\r\n![Image 2](http://g.recordit.co/3tKPNDdHrL.gif)\r\n\r\nI got this from running `ssh someserver.com pm2 status`. (On the server, [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) was running and linked to keymetrics.io.)\r\n\r\nEDIT: Further investigation in devtools shows that both the things which replicate themselves appear to be links, one in a subtle way - as an `xterm-invalid-link`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6010463/27049968-3e4bbf22-4fb1-11e7-8454-2f8ac745ccba.png)\r\n\r\nEDIT2: It seems that this is triggered if certain characters are on the same line as a link. For example, try typing `echo ‚óè http://google.com` - it is already messed up:\r\n![Image 3](http://g.recordit.co/p6mxRmRnFm.gif)\r\n\r\nEDIT3: Doesn't even have to be an actual scroll as in \"change in Y viewport position\", just pressing Ctrl+Up on the top line already shows it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28556","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28556/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28556/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28556/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28556","id":235322301,"number":28556,"title":"Improvement:

VSCode Version: 1.13.0\r\n- OS Version: Windows 7, 10.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Go to \"Control Panel\\Appearance and Personalization\\Display\", set text size to \"Medium - 125%\"\r\n2. Set `\"window.zoomLevel\": 0`, move the cursor around, observe it occasionally being twice as wide:\r\n\r\n![vscode cursor width bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/308111/27043241-1fe8d79a-4fa2-11e7-8431-b68ee21c7654.gif)\r\n\r\nThis is more or less a duplicate of #22904, except the workaround there was to not use `window.zoomLevel` at all, while in my case I'm not using it, it's Chromium deciding to respect the OS setting in a way that breaks vscode rendering if I understand it correctly.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I want to add an actual work-around, two even.\r\n\r\n1. Set `window.zoomLevel` to ~~-1.25~~ -1.2239 (**edit:** see below comments, that was close enough though) , this will negate the OS setting. \r\n\r\n     The actual formula ~~seems to be `-(OS_zoom - 100) / 20`: each negative point in zoomLevel decreases text size by 20%, in a sense of dividing text size by `1 + 0.2 * zoomLevel`. So if we need to compensate for a 25% increase, we need -1.25 points, and for 50% it's -2.5 points.~~ actually it's 1.2 raised to the power of zoomLevel, positive or negative.\r\n\r\n2. Or if you'd prefer a larger UI instead, you can set zoomLevel to 1, this gives you `1.25 * 1.2 = 1.5` combined zoom factor, which apparently doesn't produce the same artifacts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28541","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28541/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28541/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28541/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28541","id":235280218,"number":28541,"title":"Integrated Terminal: Windows 10 Prompting me to associate ng command with a program","user":{"login":"hhmultimediallc","id":16787094,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16787094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhmultimediallc","html_url":"https://github.com/hhmultimediallc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhmultimediallc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhmultimediallc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhmultimediallc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhmultimediallc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhmultimediallc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhmultimediallc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhmultimediallc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhmultimediallc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhmultimediallc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true},{"id":374931321,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"006b75","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2017-06-12T15:56:01Z","updated_at":"2017-06-19T20:20:51Z","closed_at":"2017-06-19T20:20:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

seconds\r\n5. see a warning about VS Code installation being corrupt\r\n\r\nHere is what happens:\r\n* Squirrel downloads the update and shows the notification\r\n* User quits\r\n* Squirrel starts to apply the update\r\n* User starts\r\n* Squirrel has not finished applying the update, you are still on the old workbench\r\n* after 10s our integration check kicks in\r\n* by now Squirrel has finished the update\r\n* we show an integrity failure warning because the files have actually changed while we were running\r\n\r\nBottom line: this does NOT reproduce when the user decides to apply the update where we then call `quitAndInstall()` which seems to do everything nicely in one call. What we actually need is a `quitAndInstall` method that does not restart which we should always call when an update is available to prevent this (only really quit when the update is installed).\r\n\r\nOne thing I verified is that Squirrel is NOT replacing files while Code is still running, only after quit.\r\n\r\n/cc @alexandrudima maybe we need to tweak this warning message to ask the user for a restart first to see if that fixes
