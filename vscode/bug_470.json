Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.10.0\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10Pro\r\n- Build: 14393.693\r\n\r\nI am really enjoying VS Code while working with JS and Html. Thanks for the wonderful product.  \r\nHowever, I am bit unhappy when it comes to working with PHP in VS Code. I know that VS Code is not an IDE - its an editor.  \r\n  \r\nThis is more like a feature request and I don't think that it would be too hard as similar has already been implemented in Atom and works quite well.  \r\n\r\nThe PHP intellisense by Felix Becker is a welcome addition, however it is slow. \r\nFeatures required/requested:\r\n\r\n1. Better Autocompletion with improved speed of indexing - something like Atom's  php-integrator-auto-completion\r\n2. Automatic use statements - Included in Atom's php-integrator-auto-completion  \r\n3. **If possible** Basic refactoring like renaming variables/methods and extract selected code block to a method - again Atom has a package php-integrator-refactoring  \r\n  \r\nAtom's `php-integrator` package suite works quite well and since Atom is also built using electron, I believe it won't be that difficult for VS Code team to provide such features for PHP developers.    \r\n\r\nBelow are the Atom packages repositories which I have mentioned, if it helps  \r\nhttps://github.com/php-integrator/core
