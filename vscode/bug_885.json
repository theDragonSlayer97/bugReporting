PR propose a change to allow more behaviors for the line navigation feature, through new keyboard shortcut commands.\n# The problem\n\nNow pressing `Home` and `End` keys makes the cursor move to the first/last non white space character first, then to the real beginning/end of line, and so forth. This makes VSCode behave like WebStorm for example, however I would like to be able to make it behave like Visual Studio.\n- WebStorn:\n  - `Home` goes to the first non white space character, then goes to the very beginning of the line\n  - `End` goes to the last non white space character, then goes to the very end of the line\n- Visual Studio:\n  - `Home` goes to the first non white space character, then goes to the very beginning of the line (same as WebStorm)\n  - `End` just go to the the very end of the line\n\nUntil then, I could not find the way to setup VSCode and make it behave like Visual Studio, that's why I propose a change.\n# The proposal\n\nFirst, I believe a bit a terminology is required in order to be sure that we are all on the same page.\nIf the vocabulary I use is not correct, please let me know.\n## Terminology\n\nWhat I call the **visual** boundaries of a line, is the line not including the white space characters, so simply said, the **visual** boundaries of a line go from the first 'visible' character to the last 'visible' character.\n\nThe **logical** boundaries of a line is the whole line, including all the characters from the beginning to the first line separator character, including white spaces.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n\"        alice and bob alice and bob       \"\n |       |                         |      |\n ^-------|-- logical boundaries ---|------^\n         |                         |\n         ^--- visual boundaries ---^\n```\n## New cursor commands\n\nTo be able to change the line navigation behavior, and still let other people configure it the way they want, I added new cursor commands. Existing ones are `CursorHome` and `CursorEnd` (along with their `*Select` related command).\n\nFor the ones interested, they can be found through the menu `File` / `Preferences` / `Keyboard Shortcuts`, then this way:\n\n```\n{ \"key\": \"end\",                   \"command\": \"cursorEnd\",\n                                     \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\" },\n{ \"key\": \"home\",                  \"command\": \"cursorHome\",\n                                     \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\" },\n```\n\nI added the following new commands:\n\n`Cursor*VisualThenLogical`\n`Cursor*LogicalThenVisual`\n`Cursor*VisualOnly`\n`Cursor*LogicalOnly`\n\nwhere '*' is `Home` and `End`, and of course their `*Select` related commands, making a total of 16 new commands.\n\nNote that `CursorHomeVisualThenLogical` is simply an alias to existing `CursorHome`, and the same goes for `CursorEndVisualThenLogical` aliasing `CursorEnd`, since this is the default behavior of VSCode.\n\nThe new commands appear in the list at the bottom of the keyboard shortcuts configuration file as _other available commands_.\n## Unit tests\n\nI added new unit tests (all passing) for each combination of commands and contexts.\nThose are in the file `cursor.test.ts`.\n## Linting\n\nWhen I ran the `tslint` command, some reports appeared, but none concerning the change I made, so should be fine.\n## Combination of cases\n\nI've tested the change, and it works in all line navigation modes, including all combination or selection, wrapped lines and multi cursor contexts.\n## monaco editor\n\nI had to modify `monaco.d.ts` in order to add new handlers, however I'm not sure if I'm supposed to do that, neither if I'm supposed to do it that way. I tried to find the code I needed to change in the monacor-editor related GitHub repositories, but I could not find what I was looking for.\n## Visual Studio like setup\n\n```\n{ \"key\": \"end\",           \"command\": \"cursorEndLogicalOnly\",\n                             \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\" },\n{ \"key\": \"shift+end\",     \"command\": \"cursorEndLogicalOnlySelect\",\n                             \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\" },\n{ \"key\": \"home\",          \"command\": \"cursorHomeVisualThenLogical\",\n                             \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\" },\n{ \"key\": \"shift+home\",    \"command\": \"cursorHomeVisualThenLogicalSelect\",\n                             \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\" }\n```\n\nDo not forget to set the `*Select` version, or you may experience asymmetries.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9219","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9219/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9219/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9219/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9219","id":165360560,"number":9219,"title":"Blank

VSCode Version: 1.3.1\n- OS Version: OS X 10.11.3\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Open a CSS file that has a color declaration (e.g. `border: 1px solid red`) in it. A color preview should be visible.\n2. Set your cursor to a (non-empty) line above or below the color declaration.\n3. Move the line up or down by using the `alt` + `arrow-up/arrow-down` shortcut so that it switches the line with the line from step 1.\n\n**Observations:**\n- When moving a line from the bottom _above_ the line with the color preview, the preview square sticks to the left of the moving line.\n-  When moving a line from the top _below_ the line with the color preview, the preview square becomes invisible.\n- In both cases, the preview resets itself to its original location after a short time.\n- The issue persists when starting VSC with `--disable-extensions`.\n\n**Test code snippet:**\n\n``` css\n.test {\n  display: block;\n  border: 1px solid red;\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n  background-color: green;\n  position: relative;\n}\n```\n\n**Screencast:**\n\n![vsc-bug-report](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9062294/16803541/3f945882-4907-11e6-827f-454ab13ab630.gif)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9206","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9206/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9206/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9206/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9206","id":165309913,"number":9206,"title":"View file History of file changes (local history)","user":{"login":"Jijokoickal","id":1351747,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1351747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jijokoickal","html_url":"https://github.com/Jijokoickal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jijokoickal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jijokoickal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jijokoickal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jijokoickal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jijokoickal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jijokoickal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jijokoickal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jijokoickal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jijokoickal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-07-13T12:37:19Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T20:34:21Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.2\n- OS Version: W7\n\nSteps to Reproduce:Copy paste content\n\nWhen copy file content from one to another, it replaces the whole content, sometimes not intended to do so,  and there is no option to undo that action.
