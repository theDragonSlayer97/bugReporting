So I'm making a feature request. It would be great to be able to peak at the implementation or type of an object. \r\n\r\nUse case:\r\n\r\nSuppose you call a function and store the results\r\n\r\n`const result = getAllPeopleEvents();`\r\n\r\nLet suppose the data looks like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n{\r\n  Persons: [\r\n    {name: 'John Doe', details: [Object]},\r\n    {name: 'Jane Doe', details: [Object]},    \r\n    ...\r\n  ]\r\n  Schedule: {\r\n      available: [Object] \r\n      pending: [Object]\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the interface is something like this\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface People {\r\n   name: string\r\n   details: {\r\n     address: string\r\n     phone: string\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface PeopleEvents {\r\n   Persons: [People]\r\n   Schedule ....\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// In a different file\r\nimport {getPeopleEvents} from 'library'\r\nconst getAllPeopleEvents: [PeopleEvents] = () => {...}\r\nconst result = getAllPeopleEvents()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you could somehow get this information about `result`, not just that its an array of `PeopleEvents`; that one could see the full implication of what a `result` object is. Perhaps some way to \"peek\" the implementation details in one place or maybe be able jump back and forth. This would be specially nice for finding one's way around a complex data structure.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26837","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26837/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26837/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26837/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26837","id":229458460,"number":26837,"title":"mix-blend-mode
