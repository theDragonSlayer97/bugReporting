Please use, for example: ^0.10.0, ^1.2.3, etc.`\n\nSo currently, because my extension uses the new `onWillSaveTextDocument` API, it should only be installable from versions higher then `1.6.x`. This is possible with `^1.6.0` as the carret indicates minor updates as well. BUT, what if VS Code (some day) hits `2.0.0`. Does this mean all breaking changes and thus no extension will work anymore. OR, some breaking changes and most of the extensions still work. This would mean that if `vscode.engines` is set to `^1.6.0`, it will not be available in `vscode@2.0.0` and above.\n\nFYI @joaomoreno \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13571","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13571/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13571/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13571/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13571","id":182454800,"number":13571,"title":" Recently opened folder","user":{"login":"kgtkr","id":17868838,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/17868838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgtkr","html_url":"https://github.com/kgtkr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgtkr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgtkr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgtkr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgtkr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgtkr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgtkr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgtkr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgtkr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgtkr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-10-12T07:31:21Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T14:47:27Z","closed_at":"2016-10-12T08:09:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I want \"Recently opened folder\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13570","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13570/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13570/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13570/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13570","id":182453642,"number":13570,"title":"Allow key binding for \"next result\" to \"search in files\".
