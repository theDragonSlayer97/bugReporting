However I've created a new project with TypeScript where I would like to use the specified version from my `package.json`. So what I did is the following:\r\n\r\nCreated a new file named `settings.json` inside the `.vscode` directory which lives in the project root. The current content of this file is:\r\n```json\r\n// This are workspace specific settings.\r\n{\r\n  // General settings.\r\n  \"files.exclude\": {\r\n    \"**/.git\": true,\r\n    \"**/.DS_Store\": true\r\n  },\r\n  // TypeScript settings.\r\n  \"typescript.tsdk\": \"./node_modules/typescript/lib\",\r\n  \"typescript.check.tscVersion\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy expectation would be to see in the status bar that I am using the version (2.4.0) of TypeScript which I've installed. By default it seems to be selecting the default shipped(?) version I guess, not sure where exactly it comes from. As I said, I am new to VSCode (;\r\n\r\nIf I remove the `typescript.check.tscVersion` options from the settings it will at least ask me which version to use. It is fine for me, but since the project is kind of a boilerplate it might be confusing for others. Yes, I know that you have a nice document describing it but I thought that why you added a setting for it, no?\r\n\r\n- OS Version: Mac OS 10.12.5\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.13.1 (1.13.1)\r\n- Extensions:\r\n  * EditorConfig.EditorConfig\r\n  * HookyQR.beautify\r\n  * PeterJausovec.vscode-docker\r\n  * WallabyJs.wallaby-vscode\r\n  * eamodio.gitlens\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n```sh\r\nmkdir -p vscode-workspace-settings/.vscode\r\ncd vscode-workspace-settings\r\necho '{\"typescript.tsdk\": \"./node_modules/typescript/lib\",\"typescript.check.tscVersion\": false}' > .vscode/settings.json\r\necho \"console.log('Hello you!')\" > hello.ts\r\nnpm init -y\r\nnpm install --save-dev typescript@2.4.0\r\ncode hello.ts\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29002","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29002/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29002/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29002/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29002","id":236788730,"number":29002,"title":"Got a 'bug' in language configuration.","user":{"login":"shockw4ver","id":17818522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17818522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shockw4ver","html_url":"https://github.com/shockw4ver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shockw4ver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shockw4ver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shockw4ver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shockw4ver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shockw4ver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shockw4ver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shockw4ver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shockw4ver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shockw4ver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":341269814,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/i18n","name":"i18n","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-06-19T06:10:17Z","updated_at":"2017-06-22T02:02:51Z","closed_at":"2017-06-21T12:59:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**VSCode Version:** 1.13.1;\r\n**Platform:** win10;\r\n\r\nI tried to set the language of vscode as Chinese, so I opened the language configuration and modified the value from 'en' to 'zh'.

developing a VS Code extension which contributes a jsonValidation.  The schema is derived from a Swagger specification, which uses 'title' for the short-form summary of a property and 'description' for more expansive detail.  This is per [JSON Schema recommendations](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.7.2), and specifically to work with AutoRest which uses the title to generate C# `/// <summary>` documentation and the description to generate `/// <remarks>` documentation.\r\n\r\nWhen I reference this schema in VS Code, if I have a JSON property which has both a title and a description in the schema, the tooltip for that property is the _description_, not the title.  If I have a JSON property which has a title but no description, no tooltip is shown for that property.  In my extension this leads to awkward remarks-level detail in tooltips, or to no documentation at all.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if the tooltip could show the title (if present) in preference to the description, or to show the title as well as the description.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. See sample repo https://github.com/itowlson/vscode-json-schema-test and load the extension.  Note the contents of `schema/foo.schema.json`.\r\n2. Run this extension in the Extension Development Host (or create a new extension and add the `jsonValidation` section and `foo.schema.json` file from the sample repo).\r\n3. In the Extension Development Host, open the file `test/test.foo.json`.\r\n4. Hover over the `\"id\"` element.  **Expected:** Tooltip showing \"A unique ID.\"  **Actual:** Tooltip showing \"May be up to 64 characters.\"\r\n5. Hover over the \"displayName\" element.  **Expected:** Tooltip showing \"A name for use in a UI..\"  **Actual:** Nothing happens.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: Code 1.13.1 (379d2efb5539b09112c793d3d9a413017d736f89, 2017-06-14T18:21:47.485Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.16199\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|jslint|ajhyndman|1.2.1|\r\n|vs-kubernetes|brendandburns|0.0.8|\r\n|jshint|dbaeumer|0.10.15|\r\n|vscode-eslint|dbaeumer|1.2.11|\r\n|python|donjayamanne|0.6.5|\r\n|EditorConfig|EditorConfig|0.9.3|\r\n|tslint|eg2|0.15.0|\r\n|Go|lukehoban|0.6.62|\r\n|swagger-doc-viewer|mimarec|1.0.4|\r\n|csharp|ms-vscode|1.10.0|\r\n|debugger-for-chrome|msjsdiag|3.1.4|\r\n|vscode-docker|PeterJausovec|0.0.16|\r\n|Ruby|rebornix|0.12.1|\r\n|stylelint|shinnn|0.24.8|;\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4325","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"83D2:3670:A451AB:1A7817C:59D93516","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=228>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=226>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"5f3fea97c4be1be0f710602a04fcf218\"","status":"200 OK"}}
