I see no extensions to update. First I thought it's a bug. But then I noticed (looking at tiny 12), that I have already installed 12 extensions, and the problem in this \"Recommended list of whatever\", that covers a half of whole extensions area.\r\n\r\nWell, guys, that's confusing and annoying! If some genius in VS Code dev team decided to add this \"recommended list of some annoying stuff\", why he or she didn't think about showing a scroll bar BY DEFAULT in \"Installed exts list\"? Is it so hard? Why was it so necessary to make a list of \"recommended exts\" to cover half height of whole extensions area? If it's only, by the way, 5 extensions there you have to recommend me to install.\r\n\r\nIf you will look at screenshot, and you don't remember how many of exts you have already installed, doesn't it look like you installed only 7 exts? And only super-extra-tiny number 12 will remind you, that you have installed 12 exts, and that you should scroll list a little bit down.\r\n\r\nYou just should find a way to fix this confusing UI component.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24613274/29145546-4ec32c40-7d66-11e7-9296-2e735f7a04f2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32197","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32197/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32197/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32197/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/32197","id":249170785,"number":32197,"title":"Fix onDidChangeTextEditorSelection firing when the editor is resized","user":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-09T21:42:32Z","updated_at":"2017-08-23T17:50:28Z","closed_at":"2017-08-23T17:50:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/pulls/32197","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/32197","diff_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/32197.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/32197.patch"},"body":"**Bug**\r\n`onDidChangeTextEditorSelection` is being fired when the editor window is resized.
