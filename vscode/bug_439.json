This envolves calling [`contextMatchRules`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/5cbb1b0d8e7659f1538286d2d3c1ef4eba4221ed/src/vs/platform/contextkey/browser/contextKeyService.ts#L171) which creates an object containing the whole context at that given point in time.\r\n\r\nI found this while implementing multi-select in the SCM viewlet, which happens to use Menus extensively, where creating all these contexts all the time flared up the CPU profiler quite a lot:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22350/23921704/eaf23182-08ff-11e7-88c4-707c1899a39f.png)\r\n\r\nIn this profile, I'm multi selecting rows in the SCM viewlet, which makes them refresh, which makes them re-render. Re-rendering these causes `getActions` to get called, creating all those contexts, which happens to be taking up most of the CPU time. Each of those is a single click, blocking the UI thread for ~250ms.\r\n\r\nBy creating an `IContext` type, I introduce a `getValue` method, which simply avoids creating static contexts all the time. Plus it gets rid of a few `any` types.\r\n\r\nAfter the PR, the profile looks like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22350/23922096/5ef16246-0901-11e7-9e9d-c31ab28d9d96.png)\r\n\r\nEach of the multi-selections takes now ~50ms. Further optimization needs to happen on the list/renderer side.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnother alternative which I have explored is to use ES6 Proxy objects for contexts which would let us have dynamic _getters_. This is cool 🏄 but barely usable in browsers in which the editor has to be compatible. We can still do it for Electron, although it would just be unnecessary voodoo, imo.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI realise that making the context values accessible via a `getValue` method might not be ideal, or even against the whole point, because we might want to keep the context static. But we seem to be paying a high price for that choice. This PR aims to open up that conversation, as it is my opinion that we need to improve performance in this area.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22626","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22626/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22626/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22626/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22626","id":214194211,"number":22626,"title":"Can't

VSCode Version: 1.11.0-insider\r\n- OS Version: Win 10\r\n\r\nI can't quite figure out exactly what seems to cause this, but a common factor seems to be when the launch.json file is hand-edited as mentioned in the repro steps.  Once VS code gets into a state where the Node.js specific debug config options are displayed, I can't figure out how to get them back - the only way I have found is to delete the launch.json file and start over which obviously isn't ideal.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. In VS Code, clone the following node.js project: https://github.com/scotch-io/node-todo\r\n2. Open the above project, click the debug button in the left hand pane, and then in the debug configuration drop-down menu, choose to \"Add configuration\" (note that at this point, you shouldn't have any configurations created).\r\n3. From the configuration popup menu, notice that you are presented with a list of common Node.js configurations - select the \"Node.JS: Launch Program\" configuration.\r\n4. In the first configuration option, change the \"program\" value to \"${workspaceRoot}/server.js\" - don't change anything else in the file and then save.\r\n6. Open the debug configuration drop-down menu again and choose \"Add configuration\".\r\n\r\nThis time, when the configuration popup menu is displayed, all of the Node.js configuration options are missing.  Refer to the first attached screen shot shows the actual list; the second screenshot shows what should be displayed instead.\r\n\r\n![actual](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10600161/23920024/15274ca0-08c7-11e7-9739-f99c971ccd44.png)\r\n![expected](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10600161/23920023/150e10b4-08c7-11e7-8609-3aec8e643e2a.png)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22623","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22623/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22623/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22623/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22623","id":214189478,"number":22623,"title":"Hide/dispose

VSCode Version: 1.11.0-insider\r\n- OS Version: Win 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThis issue likely can be repro'ed with other types of projects, but I ran into this when working with node.js where you hover over a value during debugging that contains a large string.  \r\n\r\nFor example, node.js's internal modules have methods that take the contents of an entire javascript file as a string parameter in order to compile it (such as VM.js's runInThisContext method) - if you attempt to hover over this parameter to see its value while debugging, you aren't able to see all of the javascript because it is cutoff and there isn't any ability to scroll within the window to see all of the javascript.  This can be painful when trying to debug.\r\n\r\nBelow are basic steps to repro the issue - but keep in mind, that the real scenario when I've hit this is when debugging through node.js internal modules where javascript is passed around as a string parameter.\r\n\r\n1. Create a node.js project\r\n2. Store a string as a var and place a break point on the variable (the string should be very long, such as the contents of a multiline js file)\r\n3. When you hit the breakpoint, hover over the var to see it's value\r\n\r\nNotice that the popup that shows the value of the string doesn't have scrollbars - also, if the contents of the string are long enough, the text will be cut off so that you can't see the entire contents of the string value.\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot that also shows the problem - note that when I hover over the \"code\" parameter.  The popup window doesn't have anyway to scroll through the entire contents of the \"code\" parameter and it's cutoff so that I can't view all of the parameter's value.\r\n![cutoff](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10600161/23923229/d656e992-08d3-11e7-9413-839050922d44.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22621","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22621/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22621/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22621/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22621","id":214175164,"number":22621,"title":"Cursor
