MAC address.\n\nThere are a few things wrong with this from a privacy perspective.\n1. The MAC address is personally identifiable information. It allows Microsoft to identify a specific user's machine, even well after they've uninstalled Visual Studio Code, and can be easily correlated with other data sources.\n2. Hashing does not anonymize. Microsoft can still look up a user by their MAC address.\n3. MAC addresses are 48 bits, so the sha256 hash is relatively easily reversed to a unique value.\n\nIf VS Code wants to identify a given installation, the generally accepted method is to create a random value on first use and persist it.\n\nIt appears [other Microsoft developers](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/3494) are relying on this worrying precedent, which makes it all the more important that this be fixed

A brute force way of passing on useful context would be to pass the text of the document in which the code is being executed if it is executed from a selection inside an editor. \n\nA more general approach would be to let an extension register a context generator function that gets passed the editor (to determine the selected text) and returns the `EvaluateArguments` object to be passed to the debug adapter. In this way the generator could limit the contextual information to only what is required (like the enclosing namespace in the case of Clojure).

`<ng-include src = \"'./view/template/header.html'\"></ng-include>`\n\nWhen using single quotes within double quotes.\n\nDo not allow it to be considered link when something comes after the extension.\n\nExample: `<script scr = \"js/angular/angular.min.js?\"></script>`\n`<link rel = \"stylesheet\" href = \"css/animate.css?\"/>`\n\nSimilar as in Eclipse.\n\n---Suggestion---\n\n*I did not find these options in VSCode\n- Open in a new tab when you click this link, as currently happens when we use with \".html\"\n- For when image, example: `<link rel = \"shortcut icon\" href = \"img/ico.png\">` or `<img src = \"img/ico.png\" />` have the option to choose whether you want to open with VSCode or my standard program.\n\nIn Eclipse, do not open a \".html\" that is within the same folder (not considered link), when you put the full path. If possible do VSCode accept the way complete and short.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8684","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8684/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8684/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8684/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8684","id":163541853,"number":8684,"title":"[jsx]
