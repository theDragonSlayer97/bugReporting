This is what I see:\r\n\r\n> TypeScript definitions for socket.io\r\n> Latest version: 1.4.29\r\n\r\n Also, when I click \"Check for Updates\", under the \"Code\" tab, I get \"No updates are currently available\". How can I ensure that when I hover over a dependency in my package.json, that VSC will actually show me the most current versions of various libraries? I tried manually entering what I know to be the most recent version of socket.io - which is \"2.0.1\", but then I get a compilation error.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26774","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26774/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26774/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26774/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26774","id":229174738,"number":26774,"title":"\"Find All References\" throws error","user":{"login":"stephensong","id":108766,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/108766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephensong","html_url":"https://github.com/stephensong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephensong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephensong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephensong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephensong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephensong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephensong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephensong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephensong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephensong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":286886536,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-05-16T21:29:35Z","updated_at":"2017-05-17T03:27:54Z","closed_at":"2017-05-17T01:10:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.12.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

I am able to do this using the UI (by clicking the \"Stage\" button on one of the selected files), but not with a configured keyboard shortcut.\r\n\r\nFor example, in SourceTree I'm used to selecting a few files (by either control- or shift-clicking), then hitting the space bar to stage them. I tried adding the space bar as a shortcut for the \"git.stage\" command, but this will only commit a single file in the selection, not all selected files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n 1. Open VS Code and configure a keyboard shortcut for the \"git.stage\" command\r\n 1. Open a git project\r\n 1. Make changes to multiple files in the project\r\n 1. Go to the Source Control pane in the explorer\r\n 1. Control-click or shift-click to select multiple files in the \"Changes\" section, then type the keyboard shortcut configured above\r\n\r\nExpected Result: All selected files should be staged and appear in the \"Staged Changes\" section\r\nActual Result: Only the top file in the selected set is staged\r\n\r\nRelated to this, is there a context for keyboard shortcuts that is specific to when the Source Control pane of the explorer is active?

Some new points being added-\r\n- I think this should be a toggle to on/off feature and not a setting.\r\n- And parent syntax nodes should smoothly stack up or goes out of stack while scrolling.\r\n- This should be tied with the current viewport and not current cursor position in my opinion.\r\n- For if-else chains and switch cases (previous) sibling nodes should also be included in the stack.\r\n- This can be solely based on indentation instead of actual syntax tree of the language, just like current folding in vscode.\r\n- There should be a minimum height of the viewport without parent nodes, with actual code, which may be half the height of full viewport. When that value will be reached (like for heavily nested code), furthest or top most parent nodes can be hidden in that order. The closes parent nodes will remain visible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26757/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26756","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26756/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26756/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26756/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26756","id":229072046,"number":26756,"title":"Snippets
