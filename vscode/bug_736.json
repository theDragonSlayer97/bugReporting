Nothing.\n2. Be be missing important elements from the default `$PATH`.\n\nSo I literal decided to give this Editor a shot maybe 4 minutes ago, so bit of a rocky start 🙀 but at least I can tell you what's up!\n\nOn Darwin, the default _SC_PATH (`sysconf PATH`) is augmented (for all users, including root) **by the terminal** with the paths contained in the file `/etc/paths` and in files within `/etc/paths.d`. This is done by sourcing the shell with the output `/usr/libexec/path_helper`, immediately prior to the shell beginning its own initialization routines (sourcing `.[bash][rc|_profile]`, etc. I'm not 100% sure on the implementation but between Terminal.app and especially iTerm (it being open source) it shouldn't be too hard to figure out the \"exact right way\" to do this.\n\nThis _is_ **extremely important**, as paths \"as trivial\" as `/usr/local/bin` enter the `PATH` this way;\n`getconf PATH` is only `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`!\n\n Doing a 10 second search, this is probably also #13671, and I'd guess a few other issues you have open as well.\n\nCheers,\nG\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13700","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13700/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13700/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13700/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13700","id":182885277,"number":13700,"title":"in-product

The folders are shared but I need to provide my credentials occasionally when I reconnect. If I attempt to open the folder (e.g. from the Recent folder list or by typing \\server\\share) whilst the drive is not authenticated, then VS Code logs a failure and removes the folder from the recent folder list.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. open a network share which is valid but which requires credentials to be provided as a folder from the recent folder list.\n2. VS Code fails to open - does not provide a way of providing credentials.\n\nIdeally, VS Code would detect the failure mode and allow credentials to be entered. At least, it would be nice if the folder was not removed from the recent list.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13698","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13698/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13698/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13698/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13698","id":182874614,"number":13698,"title":"Console height issues","user":{"login":"yaacovdesign","id":1609460,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1609460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaacovdesign","html_url":"https://github.com/yaacovdesign","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaacovdesign/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaacovdesign/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaacovdesign/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaacovdesign/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaacovdesign/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaacovdesign/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaacovdesign/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaacovdesign/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaacovdesign/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-10-13T19:11:06Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T15:28:10Z","closed_at":"2016-10-14T14:19:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.6.0 (e52fb0bc87e6f5c8f144e172639891d8d8c9aa55, 2016-10-10T18:37:40.189Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14942\n- Extensions: bajdzis.vscode-twig-pack-1.0.0, dbaeumer.vscode-eslint-1.0.8\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

VSCode Version: 1.6.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10 (build 14393.222)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.  Open or create a .html file.\n2. Type a double (\") or single (') quote.\n3. Start typing a snippet prefix (any predefined snippet, such as 'a' for a link, will do).\n\nExpected behavior: the snippet will be highlighted and pressing tab will expand the snippet.\nObserved behavior: nothing happens.\n\nThis is problematic for me because (for reasons I won't go into here) I often use snippets inside the the 'style' attribute of a html element. For instance, I have a snippet with the prefix 'stct' to enter 'text-align:center;'.
