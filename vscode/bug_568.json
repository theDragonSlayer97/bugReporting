In the left view I have \"file.h\" opened, \"file.cpp\" is opened in right view. Issuing \"C_Cpp.SwitchHeaderSource\" command in \"file.h\" tab creates new tab \"file.cpp\" in left view. Seems like it should focus already opened \"file.cpp\" tab in right view. If there is no tab with corresponding source (or header) it should be created in the same view side by side with tab from which command has been issued.\r\n\r\n![vscode](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24456989/21926730/165b3774-d994-11e6-80f0-1060f3ab447a.gif)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18729","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18729/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18729/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18729/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18729","id":201558940,"number":18729,"title":"typingsInstaller/telemetry process causing high CPU usage","user":{"login":"laggingreflex","id":2523987,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2523987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laggingreflex","html_url":"https://github.com/laggingreflex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laggingreflex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laggingreflex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laggingreflex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laggingreflex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laggingreflex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laggingreflex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laggingreflex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laggingreflex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laggingreflex/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":291055694,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/typescript","name":"typescript","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-01-18T12:17:50Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T01:56:33Z","closed_at":"2017-02-24T02:48:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
