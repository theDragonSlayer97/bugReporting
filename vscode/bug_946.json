When i treid this i get a error.  The issue i believe is that this file doesn't have a file type and it can't distinguish if its a folder or not. Probably failry big edge case and not a critical bug. \n1. Create a file with no extension. mine is called dockerfile\n2. right click on the site and select add new folder\n3. type in dockerfile\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3301804/15879296/b2c3d248-2cd7-11e6-8286-eab710bbbcf0.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3301804/15879300/b6546a58-2cd7-11e6-9768-1e6f113f25bc.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7375","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7375/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7375/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7375/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7375","id":159055777,"number":7375,"title":"cant copy text from integrated terminal","user":{"login":"ravinsinghd","id":9314601,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9314601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinsinghd","html_url":"https://github.com/ravinsinghd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinsinghd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinsinghd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinsinghd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinsinghd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinsinghd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinsinghd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinsinghd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinsinghd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinsinghd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-08T00:40:52Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T00:49:37Z","closed_at":"2016-06-08T00:49:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:1.2.0\n- OS Version:Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. selected text from terminal\n2. tried right click. no context menu open \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7374","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7374/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7374/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7374/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7374","id":159052856,"number":7374,"title":"Insiders can't start Go debug session: \"Cannot find Delve debugger.\"","user":{"login":"lirao","id":6883412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6883412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirao","html_url":"https://github.com/lirao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-08T00:15:25Z","updated_at":"2016-06-09T07:59:53Z","closed_at":"2016-06-09T07:59:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"- VSCode Version: Version 1.3.0-insider 2016-06-07T14:59:54.411Z\n- OS Version: OSX El Capitian\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
