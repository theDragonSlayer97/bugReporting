VSCode Version: 1.4.0 / 1.5.0-insiders\n- OS Version: Windows 7 64bits / Windows 10 64bits\n\nI'm editing a very long ~11.000 lines CSS file (attached), and VSCode is behaving surprising well, but I've found some problems:\n\n[global.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/409009/global.zip)\n\n1- TAB insertion is very slow, every time I push TAB the editor halt for about 1 second.\n2- Sometimes the editor becomes unresponsive, and a popup instructs me to close or restart\n3- Sometimes seems that only Monaco halts. I can change tabs, etc, but I can't edit any file.\n\nThat usually happens when I'm editing near the end of the file. Extensions make things worse, but I can reproduce the problem without any extensions.\n\nTo reproduce: try to type fast and use TAB and ENTER as much as possible. CTRL+S from time to time. In my tests I can hang the editor just hitting TAB and ENTER like a maniac.\n\nI'm really \"ok\" about some slowness giving the size of the file, but I believe that the editor should try not to hang and lose the user work.\n\n![2016-08-09 10_24_58-program

You're doing fantastic work.\n\nI am in the process of gradually moving a codebase to using TypeScript. There are certain compiler options which I want to enable, namely no implicit any and strict null checking, however because I am moving things gradually, I only want to enforce these stricter rules on a subset of TypeScript files.\n\nMy solution to this is to wrap the TypeScript compiler, filtering out error messages from no implicit any and strict null checking where the file is not whitelisted as “strict”. For example: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/8855#issuecomment-237915223\n\nHowever, I do not want to use such a solution in my project without corresponding feedback in my IDEs.\n\nIs there any way I can wrap the TypeScript compiler used in vscode similarly to how I wrapped the TypeScript compiler in https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/8855#issuecomment-237915223?\n\nOr, perhaps I could use my wrapped compiler and send those errors to vscode instead of using the built in TypeScript errors?\n\nIs there somewhere I can find the code that sends the TypeScript errors to vscode?\n\nI want to achieve this for other plugins in other IDEs too, to suit all the developers in my team, but also because I think this will be useful to other people who are gradually moving their codebase to TypeScript and want to start using some of the stricter compiler options.\n\nThanks,\nOlly\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10336","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10336/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10336/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10336/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10336","id":170114919,"number":10336,"title":"Non-ASCII

VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10 - Version 1511 (OS Build 10586.494)\n- Installed Extensions: csharp (1.3.0)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Launch VS Code.\n2. Open the integrated terminal (CTRL+~).\n3. Type some text into the terminal.\n\nExpected:\n\nThe text appears promptly upon entering, and CPU usage shows no spikes.\n\nActual:\n\nThe text does not appear immediately.  Task Manager shows one of the VSCode processes is using nearly 100% of a CPU core for around 1-2 seconds.  Afterwards, the input text appears in the terminal, and CPU usage drops to minimal values.\n\nNotes:\n\nAfter rebooting my machine, VSCode initially performs as expected.  However, performance will eventually drop considerably and stay consistently poor even after relaunching VSCode.  Only a full reboot seems to temporarily address the issue.\n\nWhile I do not have full Visual Studio or the performance toolkit on this machine to be able to capture more detailed profiling data, I was able to use Task Manager to capture a minidump of the process during the high CPU usage.  As the resulting file is about 350MB, I will defer uploading until someone requests
