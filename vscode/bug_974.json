Editor stacks surface in two areas of the user interface: the newly introduced **Opened Editors** view in the explorer (replaces **Working Files**) and generally in the **editor area** to the right. We still support a maximum of 3 editor groups, each having their own stack of editors that were opened.\n\n**Note**: please test with auto save turned off!\n\n**Pro**: you can bind `_workbench.printStacksModel` to a key to print the stacks model as plain text to console. you can bind `_workbench.validateStacksModel` to quickly check if the stacks model is in bad shape. This is helpful when filing a bug when you notice stale state between the stacks model and the UI.\n\n**Verify:**\n- each editor group has a **stack of editors** attached to it\n  - the stack grows when you open editors and pin them (italics indicates preview state)\n  - you can pin editors e.g. by changing contents in the file \n  - closing an editor reveals the previous editor you looked at (MRU order)\n  - you can see a list of editors in the stack from the overflow action (double arrow down icon)\n  - you can work with the group from the overflow dropdown menu (\"...\" icon)\n  - you can still move groups around to reorder them\n  - you can use `Ctrl+Tab` to navigate tabs in MRU order\n  - you can use `CtrlCmd+Alt+Tab` to navigate all editors in spatial order\n  - you can use <kbd>CtrlCmd Shift T</kbd> to reopen a closed (pinned) editor\n  - normal quick open history works as before and shows you a linear history of editors opened even after you closed editors\n- the **opened editors** view always reflects the state of stacks in the editor area\n  - if you have more than one group, you will see the list separated by groups\n  - actions in the context menu on groups and editors make sense\n  - you can DND editors between groups, within groups and from the explorer\n  - you can configure the maximum number of visible entries and the dynamic sizing in settings\n  - you can hide the view completely via settings (`explorer.openEditors.visible`)\n- in **general**\n  - you see dirty indicators when changing files (or untitled) and get prompted to save on close (including closing all editors or an entire group)\n  - all UI state is preserved and restored on restart\n  - opened editors view and editors in general t react to file changes (delete, move, etc.)\n  - you can still drag and drop multiple files into Code to open them\n  - you can still open multiple files when starting from command line\n\nBe **creative** and try to break the editor stacks model by doing some crazy stuff\n    \\* please keep the steps in mind that lead you to breakage if possible when filing issue\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6535","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6535/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6535/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6535/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6535","id":155739018,"number":6535,"title":"Take
