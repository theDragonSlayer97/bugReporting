on #8989, we have the ability to bind shortcuts for `maximizeEditor` and `evenEditorWidths` as a workaround for the fact that `Maximize Editor Group and Hide Sidebar` is not a toggle.\r\n\r\nWould it

Find a long \"default\" setting category, such as \"Composer Dependency Manager for PHP Configuration (2)\"\r\n5.  Notice sub items:\r\n\r\n  // Is composer enabled.\r\n  \"composer.enabled\": true,\r\n\r\n  // Path to the composer executable.\r\n  \"composer.executablePath\": null,\r\n\r\n6.  Expand the divider bar between the default settings and the overrides window (user settings).\r\n7.  When you can see the complete text on on line, then begin to SHRINK the divider bar forcing the text for  \"Composer Dependency Manager for PHP Configuration (2)\" to contract and wrap onto 2 or 3 lines.\r\n8.  The text for main heading \"Composer Dependency Manager for PHP Configuration (2)\" will overlap the text for setting \"composer.enabled\": true, - making it difficult to read the setting.\r\n\r\n![default settings before shrink](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26986675/24780487/f5b9b002-1af4-11e7-88c9-3196e72a4856.png)\r\n![default settings after shrink -

Whether I'm copying a code snippet, a JSON payload, or a full script, I typically just double-click in the tab bar to open a new blank document, paste in the code, and then want to parse through it.  Using Sublime Text, it was easy to simply open the command palette, type \"js\", pick \"set syntax: JavaScript\", and I was good to go.  Once I was done perusing the contents, I could just close the tab, choose to leave the file unsaved, and I was back to a squeaky-clean workspace.\r\n\r\nBut with VS Code, it seems like there's no way to specify a syntax other than saving a file with a specific extension.  This means that my previously smooth workflow now has the added requirements of saving the file (that I have no intention of keeping) to disk somewhere, then remembering to go and delete it after I'm done looking through it.\r\n\r\nI don't think there's any need to get fancy, like trying to remember syntax overrides on specific files - I'd say that the current behavior of applying the associated syntax highlighting whenever the file is opened is fine. I'd just like to be able to override the automatically-applied syntax after opening, and to be able to apply a syntax to a \"new file\" without having to save it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4974","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"9134:366D:36FA39:7C69E5:59D93853","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=389>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=387>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"0c38c8cf68ee2f0f7292f7c70c57ac17\"","status":"200 OK"}}
