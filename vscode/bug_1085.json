\n\nI have a problem running my extension code on Travis. The problem is, that my extension is NOT TypeScript project, so:\n1. `- npm run vscode:prepublish` section in `.travis.yml`is not needed (when I have it there, it prints an error that typescript can not be found) and\n2. because my code is not \"prepublished\", then no \"out\" dir is created, but\n3. `vscode/bin/test`, which is called by a \"test\" script, sets current working dir to: `path.join(process.cwd(), 'out', 'test')` when my test dir is NOT set manually.\n\nSo it's a bit more complicated and solutions could be:\n1. describe it somewhere, how exactly should configuration for travis and plain javascript project look like, that one must define env var in `.travis.yml` - `- CODE_TESTS_PATH=\"$TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR/test\"` (write differencies [to web](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/testing-extensions#_running-tests-automatically-on-travis-ci-build-machines))\n2. detect whether user uses prepublish, and if so, then add an \"out\" dir to path\n\nOr maybe I'm missing something

the debugger doesn't seem to care for `settings.json:files.exclude`. For example if I exclude `**\\node_modules` (I assume that 99% of all errors are caused by me and things like `Q, mongoose, lodash` are relyible enough to not spend half of my time on clickfesting `step out` of these files) - the folder gets removed from the navigator, but when I traverse through breakpoints in the debugger - the node_modules files are still shown (not in the navigation column, but in the editor). I understand that `files.exclude` belongs to project settings, while everything debugger-related is controlled via `lounch.json`. These are 2 completely different entities or workflow layers that in theory shouldn't ever collide. So I guess there should be a separate config option in the `lounch.json` for debugger to silently jump over the excluded files. Like the `--hidden` flag in https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-inspector. Optionally, if so - there should be a level of control over the hiding for unhandled Exceptions:\n\n``` js\n\"files.exclude\": {\n        \"**/my_modules\": false //always shown\n        ,\"**/libs\": true //always hidden\n        ,\"**/node_modules\": \"normal\" // jumps over the file if there is no breakpoint or unhandled \n        ,\"**/trusted_node_modules\": [\"normal\", \"exception\"] // jumps over the file if there is no breakpoint, or any other stopper except for the defined ones\n    }\n```\n\nAlso I think there should be a way to make the debugger ignore `core modules` either through a dedicated option or through a  `files.exclude` key with a path-forbidden character, like `\"?core_module\": true` or something.\n\nThank you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3215/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3214","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3214/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3214/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3214/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3214","id":135216813,"number":3214,"title":"editor.action.triggerSuggest","user":{"login":"dblock247","id":5385169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5385169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dblock247","html_url":"https://github.com/dblock247","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dblock247/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dblock247/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dblock247/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dblock247/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dblock247/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dblock247/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dblock247/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dblock247/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dblock247/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-02-21T15:16:19Z","updated_at":"2016-02-21T18:13:26Z","closed_at":"2016-02-21T18:13:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This

It would be much better if one could iterate through all the placeholders rather than manually moving the cursor.\nThe effect would be similar to the one in the `Function Documentation` section [here](https://github.com/spadgos/sublime-jsdocs)\nWould it be possible to get a feature like this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3210/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3209","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3209/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3209/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3209/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3209","id":135192536,"number":3209,"title":"Support some way of launching without debugging like Visual Studio","user":{"login":"felixfbecker","id":10532611,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10532611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker","html_url":"https://github.com/felixfbecker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-02-21T11:19:27Z","updated_at":"2016-02-22T17:18:11Z","closed_at":"2016-02-22T17:18:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In Visual Studio, you can press Ctrl+F5 to launch the application without a debugger attached, which i befinicial for performance reasons. For VS Code this would be very helpful, because you don't always want to actually debug a file or actually cannot because there is no debug adapter extension out there yet. Currently, you have to define a \"launch\" task, which cannot get a keyboard shortcut. Having \"Launch without debugging\" would be much more semantically correct.\n- Introduce a new action in command palette \"Launch without debuggin\" with keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F5\n- If the currently selected configuration has `type` set, send the debug adapter a `launchRequest` with the additional argument `debug: false`\n- Make the debug setting `type` optional. If a configuration does not have a `type`, it can only be launched without debugging:\n  - If `runtimeExecutable` is set, spawn the runtime executable (java, bash, ...) with the `runtimeArguments`, `program` and `args`.  \n    Otherwise spawn `program` with `args` directly (like a .exe or .bat)\n  - `program` should be allowed to drop the file extension (java needs this for example)\n  - Put stdout on the debug console and send input on the debug console to stdin\n  - If `externalConsole` is true, run the script in an external console\n  - Support `preLaunchTask`\n\nExamples:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Run currently open script\",\n  \"runtimeExecutable\": \"bash\",\n  \"program\": \"${file}\"\n}\n```\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Launch\",\n  \"runtimeExecutable\": \"java\",\n  \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/MyClass\",\n  \"preLaunchTask\": \"compile\"\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3209/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3208","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3208/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3208/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3208/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3208","id":135188774,"number":3208,"title":"Grey out files ignored by version control","user":{"login":"felixfbecker","id":10532611,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10532611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker","html_url":"https://github.com/felixfbecker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixfbecker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-02-21T10:42:07Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T16:38:56Z","closed_at":"2016-02-21T10:49:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The project explorer can get very messy when you use a language where the build process produces a lot of temporary or binary files. For example, in Java you get a .class file for every single .java file, if you are using BlueJ you also get another .cxtc file for every class, for Latex you get a .log, .pdf, .dvi and a .synctex. Those files are of course all excluded through .gitignore and I will probably never ever need to edit or show those in VS Code because they are only a product of the source files.\n\nIt would reduce the clutter a lot if VS Code would give these files a greyed out color.\n\nAt the same time, I think the .git folder should show up in VS Code, just like .vscode or node_modules does. It should be greyed out like ignored files, but there are many interesting files in there that a user might want to edit, like `info/exclue` and the

common ASCII symbols in Rust code (like `->` in function declarations) are in different spans, which means they can't be displayed as ligatures in fonts that support them.

If someone has a suggestion on how to improve this, I would very much like to hear it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4915","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507415105","x-github-request-id":"DFA9:429B:9CDBCD:14B0B71:59D947B0","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1086>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1084>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"2174610aa96e2cedd884141e0ccd148b\"","status":"200 OK"}}
