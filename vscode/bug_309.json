Take a look at the following code:\r\n\r\n![2017-05-12 format selection not working in xml files](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6370145/25992013/94111822-3705-11e7-9cb6-9073cddcf2d7.PNG)\r\n\r\nIt does not fix the indentation. It does not even unify the tabs into spaces as it would in other languages - although manually invoking \"*Convert Indentation to Spaces*\" does work in this file.\r\n\r\nThis is a WiX file but it is correctly identified as XML - see exhibit B:\r\n\r\n![2017-05-12 format selection not working in xml files 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6370145/25992071/c36c3570-3705-11e7-9de0-94c9ea6a9006.PNG)\r\n\r\nIs this a known issue or bug, a new issue or bug, or simply is it the case that XML formatting is unsupported? That last case would be strange, to me, because auto indentation of XML is a pretty common feature for an IDE.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26538","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26538/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26538/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26538/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26538","id":228231140,"number":26538,"title":"Could not install typings files for JavaScript language features.","user":{"login":"CyberiumShadow","id":4259904,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4259904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CyberiumShadow","html_url":"https://github.com/CyberiumShadow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CyberiumShadow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CyberiumShadow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CyberiumShadow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CyberiumShadow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CyberiumShadow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CyberiumShadow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CyberiumShadow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CyberiumShadow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CyberiumShadow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-05-12T09:06:05Z","updated_at":"2017-07-08T21:17:41Z","closed_at":"2017-05-31T06:56:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Title says all, NPM is in path etc\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version:  [](https://my.mixtape.moe/wwadfq.png)\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
