After doing some debugging I found that it is not a problem of my AssetLoader. I think it is caused by the lack of proper storing when the app pauses and then resumes.\nThis problem even occurs when there is some lagging (in my simulator for example), so I believe it is related to the lifecycle.\n\nThis is what my IOSLauncher looks like:\n\n```\nprotected IOSApplication createApplication() {\n\n    IOSApplicationConfiguration config = new IOSApplicationConfiguration();\n    config.useAccelerometer = true;\n    config.useCompass = true;\n    config.orientationPortrait = true;\n    config.orientationLandscape = false;\n    return new IOSApplication(new Game(this), config);\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean didFinishLaunching(UIApplication application,\n                                  UIApplicationLaunchOptions launchOptions) {\n    FBSDKApplicationDelegate.getSharedInstance().didFinishLaunching(application, launchOptions);\n    initialize();\n    return true;\n}\n\n\npublic void initialize() {\n    //...\n}\n\n\npublic static void main(String[] argv) {\n    NSAutoreleasePool pool = new NSAutoreleasePool();\n    UIApplication.main(argv, null, IOSLauncher.class);\n    pool.close();\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void showAds(boolean show) {\n    //...\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void shareOnFacebook() {\n    //...\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void inviteFriends() {\n    //....\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean openURL(UIApplication application, NSURL url,\n                       String sourceApplication, NSPropertyList annotation) {\n    super.openURL(application, url, sourceApplication, annotation);\n    return FBSDKApplicationDelegate.getSharedInstance().openURL(\n            application, url, sourceApplication, annotation);\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void didBecomeActive(UIApplication application) {\n    super.didBecomeActive(application);\n    FBSDKAppEvents.activateApp();\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void willResignActive(UIApplication application) {\n    super.willResignActive(application);\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void willTerminate(UIApplication application) {\n    super.willTerminate(application);\n}\n}\n\n```\n\nMy Game class:\n\n```\n@Override\n   public void create() {\n            gameScreen = new GameScreen(this);\n      //...\n   }\n\n   @Override\n   public void render() {\n      super.render();\n      //......\n\n   }\n\n   @Override\n   public void pause() {\n      super.pause();\n   }\n\n   @Override\n   public void resume() {\n      super.resume();\n      Textures.load();\n   }\n\n   @Override\n   public void dispose() {\n      super.dispose();\n      Textures.dispose();\n   }\n```\n\nand the game screen:\n\n```\npublic class GameScreen implements Screen {\n    private Game game;\n    public GameScreen(Game game) {\n        world = new World();\n        renderer = new Renderer(world);\n        dt = 0;\n        this.game = game;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void show() {\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void render(float delta) {\n        world.update(delta);\n        dt += delta;\n        renderer.render(dt);\n\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void resize(int width, int height) {\n        renderer.getViewport().update(width, height);\n        renderer.camera.position.set(renderer.camera.viewportWidth / 2,\n                renderer.camera.viewportHeight / 2, 0);     \n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void pause() {\n\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void resume() {\n\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void hide() {\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void dispose() {\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nSo as you can see in my core project I do not bother much with the LifeCycle, I just let libGDX do the job for me.\n\nIn my IOSLauncher I have tried the following pieces of code:\n\n```\n@Override\n    public void didBecomeActive(UIApplication application) {\n        super.didBecomeActive(application);\n        FBSDKAppEvents.activateApp();\n        Gdx.app.getApplicationListener().render();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void willResignActive(UIApplication application) {\n        super.willResignActive(application);\n        Gdx.app.getApplicationListener().pause();\n        Gdx.gl.glFlush();\n        application\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void willTerminate(UIApplication application) {\n        super.willTerminate(application);\n        Gdx.app.debug(\"IOSApplication\", \"disposed\");\n        Gdx.gl.glFlush();\n        Gdx.app.getApplicationListener().dispose();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void didEnterBackground(UIApplication application) {\n        super.didEnterBackground(application);\n        Gdx.gl.glFlush();\n        Gdx.app.log(\"did\", \"ENTER BACKGROUND\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void willEnterForeground(UIApplication application) {\n        super.willEnterForeground(application);\n        Gdx.app.log(\"WILL ENTER FOREGROUND\", \"\");\n        Gdx.app.getApplicationListener().resume();\n    }\n```\n\nThe strange thing is that even the messages are not shown in my tab, so these methods are never even called. \n\nI use RoboVM 1.14, I believe that is the latest version.\n\nGoogling the issue I found that many have encountered the same problem, however, I have spent about 2 weeks trying to find a solution and I still have not found it + my RoboVM license is ending in a couple of days......
