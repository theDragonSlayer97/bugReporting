is stored in `~/.config/Code[ - <quality>]/User`. To match platform conventions (lowercase and hyphens for everything) as well as to keep consistency with the cli `code[-<quality>]` I propose we change the settings directory one of:\r\n- `~/.config/code[-<quality>]/user`\r\n- `~/.vscode[-<quality>]` (see https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3883)\r\n- `~/.code[-<quality>]` (to prevent using 'vs' showing up in the OSS build as it is now)\r\n\r\nIf we moved this it would probably require some discovery/migration on first launch of a newer version.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe below is a living document.\r\n\r\n## Proposed folder structure\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- I don't think we should be encouraging the use of admin rights within vscode, instead a permissions elevation dialog would probably be better than allowing a specific place for root user data #5561\r\n- I want to clean up the whole `code` vs `vscode` thing in this change; only official builds should carry the visual studio branding, that should carry over to the config directories consistently as well.\r\n- The CLI args `--user-data-dir` and `--extensions-dir` will need to be adjusted for this, something like `--config-dir` and `--cache-dir` would probably be better.\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\n**Old**\r\n\r\n```\r\nSettings:                %APPDATA%\\Code[ - Variant]\\User\\settings.json\r\nKeybindings:             %APPDATA%\\Code[ - Variant]\\User\\keybindings.json\r\nSnippets:                %APPDATA%\\Code[ - Variant]\\User\\snippets\\\r\nWorkspace storage:       %APPDATA%\\Code[ - Variant]\\User\\workspaceStorage\\\r\nChromium user data:      %APPDATA%\\Code[ - Variant]\\\r\nExtensions:              %USERPROFILE%\\.vscode[-variant]\\extensions\\\r\n```\r\n\r\n**New**\r\n\r\n```\r\nSettings:                %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\[Visual Studio ]Code[ - Variant]\\settings.json\r\nKeybindings:             %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\[Visual Studio ]Code[ - Variant]\\keybindings.json\r\nSnippets:                %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\[Visual Studio ]Code[ - Variant]\\snippets\\\r\nWorkspace storage:       %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\[Visual Studio ]Code[ - Variant]\\workspaceStorage\\\r\nChromium user data:      %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\[Visual Studio ]Code[ - Variant]\\userdata\\\r\nExtensions:              %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\[Visual Studio ]Code[ - Variant]\\extensions\\\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- Note that `%APPDATA%` is roaming and `%LOCALAPPDATA%` is local, meaning extensions ***will not*** be carried across multiple machines until a solution is devised for #15442. An extension manifest, eg. `%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\[Visual Studio ]Code[ - Variant]\\extensions.json` which automatically installs extensions is my thinking of solving this problem.\r\n\r\n###

got feedback from users for debug accessibility to make the announcements as concise as possible. Here are some ideas on how to make it more concise for suggest widget:\n1. Do not announce 'suggestion' after each suggestion, instead of that announce when suggest widget opened and closed - that way the user will know that what he is hearing are suggestions inside the widget\n2. instead of saying 'name, suggestion accepted' just say 'name, accepted'\n\n@zersiax opinions very welcome\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3860","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3860/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3860/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3860/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3860","id":139306370,"number":3860,"title":"TypeScript language service crashes on projects on a mounted SharePoint WebDav folder ","user":{"login":"jandersonfcosta","id":8740625,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8740625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jandersonfcosta","html_url":"https://github.com/jandersonfcosta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jandersonfcosta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jandersonfcosta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jandersonfcosta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jandersonfcosta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jandersonfcosta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jandersonfcosta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jandersonfcosta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jandersonfcosta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jandersonfcosta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":286886536,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"egamma","id":172399,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/172399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma","html_url":"https://github.com/egamma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"egamma","id":172399,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/172399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma","html_url":"https://github.com/egamma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":20,"created_at":"2016-03-08T15:31:26Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T12:46:07Z","closed_at":"2016-08-09T12:46:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"After update VSC to 0.10.10, javascript intellisense stop working.\n\nVSC show warn message: \"**The Typescript language service died unexpectedly 5 times in the last 5 Minutes.
