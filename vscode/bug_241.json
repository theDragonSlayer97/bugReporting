But if at least one selection is non-empty, `transpose` will instead transpose the contents of the selection, replacing the contents of selection 2 with selection 1, selection 3 with selection 2, and so on until selection 1 is replaced with the contents of the last selection.\r\n\r\nThis allows quick swaps, for instance, you can double-click on one word, Opt+double-click on another word, and press Ctrl+T to swap them.\r\n\r\nVS Code currently has two Transpose actions:\r\n\r\n- `editor.action.transposeLetters`\r\n  \"Transpose Letters\" (bound to `^t` by default)\r\n- `editor.action.transpose`\r\n  \"Transpose characters around the cursor\" (not bound to anything by default)\r\n\r\nThese are very subtly different: `transposeLetters` does nothing at the end of a line, while `transpose` transposes the last character to the other side of the line break (in a clone of Sublime Text's behavior).\r\n\r\n(Note that neither of these matches the emacs/macOS behavior, which is to transpose the last two characters of the line.)\r\n\r\nThis behavior has been added to `transpose` rather than `transposeLetters`, because `transpose` seems to both be a less specific name, and because it was designed for Sublime compatibility.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28577","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28577/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28577/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28577/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28577","id":235425658,"number":28577,"title":"Command + P - Opening new code (abc.cs) does not always make new page","user":{"login":"Cliwo","id":15336467,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/15336467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cliwo","html_url":"https://github.com/Cliwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cliwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cliwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cliwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cliwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cliwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cliwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cliwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cliwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cliwo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-13T03:29:45Z","updated_at":"2017-06-14T01:24:51Z","closed_at":"2017-06-13T17:29:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.13.0 (376c52b955428d205459bea6619fc161fc8faacf, 2017-06-08T16:34:53.678Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.6.0\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|unity-debug|Unity|1.2.0|\r\n|unity-snippets|YclepticStudios|0.1.2|\r\n|eppz-code|eppz|1.2.22|\r\n|csharp|ms-vscode|1.10.0|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
