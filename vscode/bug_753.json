for information on what classes to extend to implement this behavior myself in VSCode. Looking for guidance. \n- VSCode Version: 1.5.3\n- OS Version: Windows 7 sp1\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. open a file myfile.esfc that is a proprietary format\n2. display a graphical representation of that file in html using a custom parser and graphics package\n3. allow the user to edit that graphical representation with custom controls/commands\n4. allow the user to save those changes back to the proprietary format\n\nI've looked at the previewHtml extension and created a TextDocumentContentProvider, but what I am trying to do is use VSCode as a framework for editing and verifying chart diagrams not just preview them. \n\nIt looks like the editor.contribution.ts contains the functions that register the different types of IEditorDesctiptor; string, text diff, binary with their associated IEditorInput.  Is this where a custom chartEditor and chartInput could be registered? where is the transition from file contents to the view being done? Is this done in EditorPart? It looks like it is asking the registered editor for the input to show the contents.  It looks like the fileEditorInput is used to get the appropriate IEditorDescriptor from the registry.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13182","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13182/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13182/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13182/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13182","id":180769837,"number":13182,"title":"[snippets]

VSCode Version: 1.5.3\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Enterprise (10.0.14393 Build 14393)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a typescript file in VS Code and a function to update the StatusBarItem\n   Example:\n\n``` typescript\nfunction uiBold() {\n        let statusBarItem: vscode.StatusBarItem;\n        statusBarItem = vscode.window.createStatusBarItem(vscode.StatusBarAlignment.Left);\n        statusBarItem.text = \"$(bold) Bold\";\n        statusBarItem.color = \"black\";\n        statusBarItem.show()\n        statusBarItem.command = \"extension.formatBold\";\n}\n```\n1. Create a new status bar item using the bold or italic Octicon icons [`statusBarItem.text = \"$(bold) Bold\";`]\n2. Open the file in debug mode/Extension Development Host] and run the command to launch the function\n3. Text (Bold) will render but icon will not.\n\nExpected results\nUsing the code above, change the bold icon to pencil or gear and run step 3.  Both the icon and text will show.\n\nQuestion\nIs there a minimum width required for VS Code status bar icons?  I've tried a few and the ones that do not work are 10px or smaller in width (<svg width=\"10px\").  Icons that I have tested that are 14px or larger work just fine.\n\nThanks and please let me know if you need any additional details or if you'd like me to share the ts files for the extension I'm developing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4609","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"9120:3670:A97853:1B557D9:59D9409D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=754>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=752>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"37668a281511623bc1a61273caa79e37\"","status":"200 OK"}}
