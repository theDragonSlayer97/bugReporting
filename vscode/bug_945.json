VSCode Version: 1.2.0\n- OS Version: OS X 10.11.5\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open VSCode\n2. Open any folders\n3. Browse some code (eg. c++, ts, php). Loading speed should be normal at this point.\n4. Leave VSCode alone and do step 3 every 10min. At 30min the opening time of file should be noticeable slower. After 1hr, VSCode will take 3-4 sec to load a 1KB c++ file.\n\nAdditionally, I notice one of the VSCode process is using a lot of cpu time even I just let it stay in the background.

VSCode Version: Version 1.3.0-insider (1.3.0-insider) 6bc81df453ab2156d2630fbb89ad7d0c80620420\n- OS Version: OS X 10.11.5\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. A message pops up saying there's a new version and Insiders will be updated after it restarts. \n2. Click 'Update Now'. Code closes but doesn't reopen even after waiting a very long time.\n3. After manually reopening it it's still on the previous version\n\nThis has been happening for the last few weeks so it isn't a recent development, but with the daily builds now it's a little more annoying. Downloading the most recent version from the website and replacing it works fine. The stable build of Code I have installed does the automatic update fine. I have both builds installed in my Applications folder.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7426/reactions","total_count":49,"+1":47,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":2,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7425","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7425/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7425/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7425/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7425","id":159191663,"number":7425,"title":"terminal

VSCode Version: 1.2.0\n- OS Version: Arch Linux\n\nvscode is (as expected) available via 3rd-party maintained PKGBUILD's in the AUR, but I think it would be much better if MS officially provided the PKGBUILD script to AUR (if desired, it can just wrap installation from the existing .deb as many AUR packages do).\nThis would really help increase confidence in the packages legitimacy and that the install script is genuine and trustworthy. It's also a great statement for MS to make, and really not a lot of work.\nI suspect the package would quickly be promoted to the community or extra repos with such 'official' backing, which allows pacman to access vscode without additional tooling.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7412/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7411","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7411/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7411/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7411/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7411","id":159152208,"number":7411,"title":"Add

VSCode Version: 1.2.0\n- OS Version: Windows 8.1\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open a repo in vscode so that the git bindings are active, leave this running in the background\n2. Do your git interaction with TortoiseGit as usual\n3. Notice that tortoise will regularly and randomly give errors failing to perform various operations because the repository appears to be locked (ie, some other git client is performing an operation). Tortoise will usually offer a 'retry' button; clicking retry almost always completes the action as intended.\n\nI've noticed this seems to be related to whether I have vscode running or not. I suspect vscode is semi-actively doing fetches or something?\nI'm sure this is manually configurable, but I feel like it should be more intelligent than that... perhaps vscode may also silently be experiencing repo lock failures when I'm interacting with TortoiseGit, and perhaps vscode might take this as an indicator that I'm using a separate git client, and automatically (or offer to) reduce it's auto fetch behaviour?\n\nI'm not actually sure it's fetching, it could be something else, I just notice that the problems with TortoiseGit complaining about repo locks only seem to happen while vscode is running in the background.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7409/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7408","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7408/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7408/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7408/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7408","id":159144565,"number":7408,"title":"terminal configuration tests are failing","user":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":291057332,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/verified","name":"verified","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-06-08T11:49:27Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T14:58:43Z","closed_at":"2016-06-08T11:50:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"workspace test are failing:\n\n```\n  1) Workbench -
