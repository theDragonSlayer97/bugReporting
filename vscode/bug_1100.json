if this is the wrong place to ask this, but I can't find anywhere else to ask!\n\nI'm trying to develop an extension with Typescript/ES6. It all goes well until I want to use a feature that requires a harmony flag, like `--harmony-default-parameters`, because I have no clue where to pass in that flag. I tried this in my launch.json:\n\n```\n\"runtimeArgs\": [\"--harmony-default-parameters\"],\n```\n\nbut it seems to just be ignored. \n\nThe only vaguely similar issue I found was #1568, which claims a fix in the January release. I'm running the most recent Visual Studio Code Insiders build, so if that was indeed the same issue (I'm not sure if it is), then I'm still running into the same problem.

I want to enter a back-tick (`) in OS X, I usually just press the accent key without explicitly selecting space as the accented character. (If my next action - mouse or keyboard - is not to select an accent-able character, space is implicitly selected for me.) This normally works as expected in VS Code, but not when I immediately move the cursor with the arrow keys.\n\nIf I press any arrow key directly after pressing the accent key, the text cursor is moved _first_. _Then_ the backtick is inserted in the new position. (It's apparently accenting the _move cursor_ control character!?) This gets even worse if I happen to hold down the shift key as I press the arrow key. That action selects text, which is then overwritten by the back-tick!\n\nThis happens equally for both acute and grave accent characters (´, `), as well as circumflex (^) and umlaut (¨). (I don't know what other accent characters to test, but I assume this issue applies to all of them.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2772","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2772/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2772/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2772/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2772","id":131941238,"number":2772,"title":"Nested
