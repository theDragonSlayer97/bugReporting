key-command?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31915","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31915/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31915/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31915/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31915","id":247386312,"number":31915,"title":"Duplicated
