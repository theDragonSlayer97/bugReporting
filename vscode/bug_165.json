Moreover, `type: \"node\"` if supplied to the \"complex command\" \"vscode.startDebug\" does not work anymore (see steps to reproduce below).\r\n\r\nThis is very confusing and not documented. The cases of \"node2\" and \"node\" should be merged to eliminate \"node2\". In worst case, this peculiarity should be thoroughly documented.\r\n\r\nRelated to [24762](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24762).\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n### 0) Use node.js 8.1.4\r\n\r\n### 1) Try node.js debugging with \"launch.json\":\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n    \"configurations\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": \"Launch Extension\",\r\n            \"type\": \"extensionHost\",\r\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n            \"program\": \"${file}\",\r\n            \"protocol\": \"auto\" // anything but \"legacy\"\r\n            ],\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt does work.\r\n\r\n### 2) Now, in some extension code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        const launchConfiguration = {\r\n            type: \"node\", // a real confusion! found by tracing Visual Studio Code\r\n            name: \"Launch Extension\",\r\n            request: \"launch\",\r\n            stopOnEntry: false,\r\n            protocol: \"auto\"\r\n        };\r\n        vscode.commands.executeCommand(\"vscode.startDebug\", launchConfiguration);\r\n```\r\nIt shows the error:\r\n> [DEP0062] DeprecationWarning: `node --debug` and `node --debug-brk` are invalid. Please use `node --inspect` or `node --inspect-brk` instead\r\n\r\n### 3) The workaround:\r\n\r\nChange `type: \"node\"` to `type: \"node2\"`. It works.\r\n\r\n## \r\nReproduces without extensions: No (the problem appears in extension, more exactly)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30864","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30864/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30864/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30864/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30864","id":243428711,"number":30864,"title":"Changed/Deleted

Cache the previously selected encodings for files in the format `{ filepath: encoding }`. You can set a limit on the N most recently opened files, for example. This will give an increase in performance when opening recent files and will save you from incorrect recognition of the encoding. This feature can be implemented in the context of the project, workspace or globally.\r\n\r\n2. Provide the possibility to specify used encodings in the project settings. Suppose we are working on a project that has legacy codebase in windows1251, and the rest of the files are in utf8. We can specify something like `{ projectEncodings: ['windows1251', 'utf8'] }`, and if the file's encoding is auto-detected, the editor will notify you, that the encoding is most likely not detected correctly. This option is perfectly matched with the first

I'm on OSX, fish 2.5.0., 1.14.0.\r\n>\r\n> Getting the same behavior as @lunaryorn above — removing the `-i` or changing the spawn's stdio to `['pipe', 'pipe', process.stderr]` results in returned output containing the correct `PATH`. If I dig into `result.envPairs` it's still `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin` though, I don't grok what's going on there.\r\n>\r\n> This is causing the [vscode flow extension](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode) to blow up, claiming that node isn't in the PATH, because node isn't installed in any one of `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`.\r\n>\r\n> I tried the insiders build you linked in your last comment here, but it doesn't seem to solve anything. Any pointers on how I can try running a build with the changes from #29864? Do I just need to figure out how to build VSCode? Are there any shortcuts there?\r\n> \r\n> Thanks for all of your hard work on this — it's really appreciated! ✨ 🍰 \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4387","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"CE19:366F:C3D239:17DC983:59D933F7","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=166>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=164>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"477b755dc3e8e949acfebd4810897a94\"","status":"200 OK"}}
