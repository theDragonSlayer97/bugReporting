is \"The offset of the first character which is not a whitespace character as defined by /\\s/\"\n\nIt may now be too late to change, but I found it weird that for empty or whitespace-only lines,

Therefore I'd expect the value returned in this case to be `-1` or something.\n\nIf it has to stay that way then there should really be a note in the docs I guess.\n\n**Edit:** I had it slightly wrong first time: for empty lines, it returns 0, but for lines with whitespace chars it returns the length of the string. Sure I can see the logic, though I still think it's not the value people would expect (and `leadingWhitespaceLength` would then have been a more appropriate

Choose New extension (TypeScript)\n4. npm run vscode:prepublish \n5. ls out\n6. Inspect the output\n```\n\n```\n1. yo code\n2. cd into the extension directory\n3. Choose New extension (TypeScript)\n4. rm -rf test\n5. npm run vscode:prepublish\n6. ls out\n7. Inspect the output\n```\n\nIn my opinion it shoud output the structure  below\n\n```\nout/\n    src/\n        extension.ts\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2556","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2556/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2556/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2556/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2556","id":129847850,"number":2556,"title":"Illegal

Summary\n\nI am unable to format code for `xml` and `c#`.  `json` and `javascript` do not have any issues.\n##### What I have done\n\nOriginally I modified my `editor.tabSize` to be 2 (in workspace).  I removed this override and just left in the defaults.  I also overwrote the keybinding for `editor.action.format` to use `ctrl+k ctrl+d`.  I also removed those and left just the default in.  Working with test files of each type mentioned above I am able to format some file types, but not others.  This does not seem to be dependent on any of my settings, I have just added that information in just in case it is relevant.\n##### C# example - what I expect\n\nThe following screenshot the brackets should line up in MyClass.  \n\nIn this case while the tab size is set to 2 I would also expect that `MyClass` would be moved left to adjust to the correct tab size.\n\nOfficially the starting bracket would be on the same line as the class definition for my company policy, but I do not see that option available.  Bonus points if you can mention how to set this in `VSCode`. `VS Enterprise` was able to do this with just a checkbox in settings, I am ok with a bool in json, I just do not see the value anywhere.  \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4823412/12682728/4263c060-c672-11e5-9958-4dd9f3aa1900.png)\n##### XML example - what I expect\n\nHere I expect that `subLevel3` would be tabbed in to whatever the current tab setting is.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4823412/12682872/0b85cc90-c673-11e5-8e65-b870065e79d8.png)\n##### Tech Specs\n\nWindows 10 Pro\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4823412/12682585/71c74e0e-c671-11e5-97c0-46db54335eea.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2553","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2553/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2553/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2553/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2553","id":129828385,"number":2553,"title":"Breakpoints not hit when debugging NodeJS via Launch","user":{"login":"ianwesterfield","id":15803541,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15803541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianwesterfield","html_url":"https://github.com/ianwesterfield","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianwesterfield/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianwesterfield/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianwesterfield/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianwesterfield/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianwesterfield/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianwesterfield/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianwesterfield/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianwesterfield/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianwesterfield/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2016-01-29T17:14:41Z","updated_at":"2016-05-01T09:18:05Z","closed_at":"2016-02-04T18:28:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The breakpoints seem to register with Node as the breakpoint indicator circle is red-filled.

behavior is very random and not expected but can be reproduced. For example here is my extension.ts:\n\n``` typescript\nimport * as vscode from 'vscode'; \n\nimport { FoobarCompletion } from \"./foobar\"\n\nexport function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {\n    vscode.languages.registerCompletionItemProvider(\"barfoo\", new FoobarCompletion());\n    vscode.languages.registerCompletionItemProvider(\"foobar\", new FoobarCompletion());\n}\n```\n\nFoobarCompletion is just resolving some words (a-z) using a `Thenable<vscode.CompletionItem[]>`\n\nWhen now trying to auto complete a file which is named `test.foobar` it wont work on whitespaces but `test.barfoo` would work. When switching the completion item providers around then the reverse will happen. Note that this bug only occurs when there is some content in the file already.\n\nfoobar.ts for reproducing: https://gist.github.com/WebFreak001/79e5d150cb78c833875d\npackage.json for reproducing: https://gist.github.com/WebFreak001/073847d7e96dde6567b6\n\nWhen now using that code and assuming in file test.barfoo and in test.foobar is the following text:\n\n```\nbanana {\n    |\n}\n```\n\n(`|`
