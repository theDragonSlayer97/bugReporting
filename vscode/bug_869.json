During development I tested this across all 3 OS' with Japanese and Korean IMEs as I'm familiar with them. Here are some things to try:\n- Install/enable an IME for the OS, preferably not Japanese/Korean\n- Test input, if you're familiar with the IME try all the edge cases\n  - Multiple character compositions?\n  - Multiple keystrokes per character?\n  - Multiple characters reducing to a single character?\n- Test executing a command using the text (eg. `echo`)\n\nSee
