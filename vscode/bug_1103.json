some point we should find out how an accessible debug session looks like. Debug is highly interactive so I can only assume that there needs to be some feedback reporting to the user what the state of the debugged application is in. Some thoughts:\n- announce when the program has started and debug session is active\n- announce when it stops or a breakpoint is hit\n- announce when an error is hit\n\nI pushed a change (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commit/46db05eec39a1b01eab19925a98d8307dc277f03) so that the trees in the debug viewlet (Variables, Expressions, Call Stack, Breakpoints) get announced with some meaningful data when focus is in the tree and a screen reader is connected. However, I am not sure how verbose the data should be from each of the views because the entries within can have quite some state. I suggest to check with other tools and maybe do the same.\n\n@isidorn @weinand @stevencl @chrisdias

code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging)'s [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/codebasics) on [Ubuntu Linux 14.4](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/).\n\nThe [DNVM installed is for Mono](http://xameeramir.github.io/configure-net-ubuntu-linux/). Following the steps given on [VS code's official docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/runtimes/ASPnet5), the project is created with [Yeoman scaffolder](http://yeoman.io/).\n\nWhenever trying to start the project, I get the following error:\n\n> OmniSharp server is not running. \n\nI found some posts when trying to solve this but most seems to be addressing either [Console project](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-IN/library/0wc2kk78%28v=vs.90%29.aspx) or are given for [OS x](http://www.apple.com/in/osx/):\n- [For a Console App](http://michaelcrump.net/creating-and-debugging-console-apps-with-vscode/#comment-2483329387)\n- [This is for debugging not running](http://stackoverflow.com/a/33861576/2404470)\n- The output of `mono --version` shows that it is [>3.12](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging#_mono-debugging):\n\n[![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ihnqa.png)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ihnqa.png)\n- [My dnvm is already the latest](http://stackoverflow.com/a/34845933/2404470)\n\n[![DNVM is already the latest](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y5Rz9.png)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y5Rz9.png)\n\nI can run the project by using `dnx web` command from **Terminal**.\n\nHowever, my simple question:\n- How do I run ASP.NET 5 on Ubuntu using **VS Code**?\n\n> Side question : Not sure by when the [debugging will be supported](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/runtimes/ASPnet5#_debugging). Any rumours about [the extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging#_common-questions) will be appreciated. \n\n[SOURCE](http://stackoverflow.com/q/35068910/2404470)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4897","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507415105","x-github-request-id":"E23D:3670:ACAC59:1BDDA78:59D94809","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1104>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1102>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"427a027042abc87ef966b5c614be52f5\"","status":"200 OK"}}
