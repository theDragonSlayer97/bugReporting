For unmodified, Shift and Option keys, the maps correspond to the Dvorak layout. For Cmd and Ctrl keys, the maps correspond to the QWERTY layout.\r\n\r\nThis is common with non QWERTY layouts; it is a way to ensure that the user can still operate all the commonly used keyboard shortcuts one-handed, such as those for copy, cut, paste, undo, redo, bold, etc. It is also done because many non-QWERTY users still have QWERTY printed keys on their keyboards, and keyboard shortcuts often require visual orientation rather than pure tactile orientation.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the reasons why this is done, it is something that is fully supported by the Mac OS X input model.\r\n\r\nIn all other Mac applications I have come across (except, coincidentally, for Xamarin and Visual Studio for Mac) this behaves as expected. E.g. in my case pressing the C key on a QWERTY-marked keyboard inputs the letter J as per the Dvorak layout, while pressing Ctrl+C is still processed as Ctrl+C and invokes the copy command.\r\n\r\nStarting with version 1.11.1 this is not the case for VS Code. VS Code now seems to completely disregard the modifier map and instead process shortcut key combinations against the letter each key happens to correspond to in the **unmodified** map.\r\n\r\nThis renders VS Code practically useless for me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24382","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24382/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24382/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24382/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24382","id":220508359,"number":24382,"title":"Allow me to have the option for two dock panels (one for debugger, the other for files)","user":{"login":"alanosman","id":2914981,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2914981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanosman","html_url":"https://github.com/alanosman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanosman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanosman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanosman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanosman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanosman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanosman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanosman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanosman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanosman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-04-09T23:31:46Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T05:45:58Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I would like to be able to view the watch window and the source window at the same time.
