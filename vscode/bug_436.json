Searching in other file types works fine.\r\n\r\nThis behavior survives reboots and survives restarting the Windows search service.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Ctrl+Shift+F to open Find in Files dialog\r\n2. Search options: unselect all three options (match case, whole word, use regexp)\r\n3. Files to include: one of\r\n      a) `*.ts,*.tsx`\r\n      b) `*.js,*.md`\r\n      c) `*.*`\r\n4. Files to exclude: blank\r\n5. Files excluded through settings: for me this shows\r\n        `**/.git, **/.svn, **/.hg, **/.DS_Store, **/node_modules, **/bower_components`\r\n6. Search text: some bit of text present in many files (I've used just the letter e)\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n\r\n1. See list of all files and lines of text containing the indicated search term\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\n\r\n1. When searching `*.ts,*.tsx` the results are empty even though there are many `*.ts` and `*.tsx` files matching the search condition\r\n2. When searching `*.js,*.md` the results are as expected, all `*.js` and `*.md` files matching the search conditions\r\n3. When searching `*.*` the results include `*.js,*.md`, and `*.json` files but no `*.ts` or `*.tsx` files\r\n\r\nAdditional behavior notes:\r\n\r\n1. The explorer and text editor views show the `*.ts` and `*.tsx` files in the project. \r\n\r\n2. The typescript project builds correctly when using Ctrl-Shift-B to build.\r\n\r\n3. Immediately before this condition started, Outlook reported a toast message something like \"Windows search did not correctly close the message file\" (It disappeared from the screen before I could write it down precisely). I don't know if that message is related or if it is whether it is a root cause or a symptom of some other root cause impacting both Outlook and Code. Rebooting the machine and restarting the Windows search service resolved the outlook issue but did not resolve the code issue.\r\n\r\n4. This search condition started today. For the past month I have been receiving error messages every time I launch Code that there is a \"Version Mismatch global tsc 2.1.5 != VS Code's language service 2.2.1\" I have repeatedly read the link embedded in that message and have NO IDEA how to resolve that issue because the link doesn't tell me what to change or where (though I believe the current text may well be helpful to someone who already knows how to fix the issue and merely needs a reminder of what files are involved). I doubt this search issue is related to the version issue, but I mention it, and I sincerely hope that you will please also fix the page that is linked to by that error message to have a bulleted list of \"step 1 do this step 2 do this step 3 do this\" instructions on how to make that error message go away because it's incredibly frustrating to be completely powerless to fix the error even after repeatedly reading your \"help text.\" But again, based on that error being present for a month prior to the search issue I doubt it's a root cause of this search issue.\r\n\r\n[edited to fix markup

Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\nThere was a conversation on how to insert multiple text changes that all have the same starting position over in https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/14441. To specify the order explicitly, we thought the ordering of edits in a change should work as a tiebreakers (ie: use a stable sort when ordering the edits).\r\n\r\nCan the vscode side respect this property when applying changes? After a bit of debugging, it looks like the necessary change would be to replace https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/editor/common/services/bulkEdit.ts#L98 with a stable sort.\r\n\r\nI would put up a PR except that I was unable to find an existing stable sort and I'm unsure if there's some pattern you'd prefer to use for an implementation.\r\n\r\nIf it helps, I'll later edit this with an explicit repro (the case I'm running into is currently dependent on a change I've yet to merge into https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22702","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22702/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22702/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22702/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22702","id":214553087,"number":22702,"title":"Feature Request: Configure VSC to stop auto-restore and build of .NET Core projects","user":{"login":"guardrex","id":1622880,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1622880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardrex","html_url":"https://github.com/guardrex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardrex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardrex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardrex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardrex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardrex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardrex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardrex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardrex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardrex/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-15T23:09:46Z","updated_at":"2017-03-15T23:17:28Z","closed_at":"2017-03-15T23:17:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: Win10 Pro\r\n\r\nI use VSC to work on documentation projects that include .NET Core samples.

It seems that it will take considerable effort to get done, and are not yet on the roadmap as far as I know.\r\n\r\nAs an intermediate solution, could VS Code facilitate opening embedded strings (when in TypeScript, for example) on the side buffer and syncing it with the original string, so that one could use any language infrastructure that is already automatically in place today for that buffer (highlighting HTML, SQL, etc)? Copying strings across buffers is of course possible already (and works great!) but it is not really usable until selecting the string and keeping it in sync is mostly automatic. Maybe they could be \"portals\" or something. Alternatively one could use some kind of narrowing to the part in question, but it is imperative that language services would work properly for the narrowed part as they do now for a separate buffer. \r\n\r\n**Later edit**: Published an extension that implements this, works great: [Template Literal Editor for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=plievone.vscode-template-literal-editor).
