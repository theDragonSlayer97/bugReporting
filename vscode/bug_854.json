We will ship **early September**.\nThis is a **5 week** iteration compared to our usual 4 week iterations.\nThis release will be **fully translated** you will see that reflected in our endgame schedule. We will hold back making the stable release available until we have all trandslations.\n## Vacation/Off time\n\nSeveral of us who have not yet been on vacation are out on average 1-2 weeks. Thus, team members show up with different loads.\n## Plan Items\n\n| Mark | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| :runner: | work in progress |\n| :hand: | blocked task |\n| :muscle: | stretch goal for this iteration |\n### Feedback\n- [x] Support Intellisense in the Debug Console #8114 @weinand @isidor\n  - Test #10997\n  - [x] Release notes\n- [x] Emmet: Enable emmet for other file extensions #9500 @egamma\n  - Test #11139\n  - [x]  Release notes\n- [x] Support file icons in explorer #10294 @aeschli @bpasero\n- :runner: Continue on `Quick Open` performance #55 @chrmarti @bpasero\n  - Test #11035\n  - [x] Release notes \n- [x] Add a setting to control Angular-1 tag completion proposals when editing HTML #9797 @aeschli\n  - [x] Release notes\n### Extension Contributions\n- :runner: **VIM**: Continue to increase command coverage (see [VIM extension roadmap](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)) @rebornix\n  -Test #11147\n- :runner: **Go**: Help managing issues @ramya-rao-a\n- **ESLint**, **TSLint**, and **jsHint**: Regular maintenance @dbaeumer @egamma @kieferrm\n  - [x] lint on save option\n  - :runner: support to configure location of the linter module\n    - Test #11100\n- [x] **Language Server Protocol** and SDK: Regular maintenance @dbaeumer\n### API Improvements for Extensions\n- VIM: Continue to work on the API gaps backlog (see #8997) including\n       - Test #11147\n  - [x] Window/page scroll commands #9609 @sandy081\n  - [x] More API to control folding, navigation with folding #9786 @aeschli @sandy081\n  - [x] Expose Undo history #8096 @alexandrudima\n  - [x] Add reason to selection change event #8093 @jrieken\n- Language API\n  - [x] Enable more efficient Workspace Symbol Provider by making the offset resolution lazy #890 @jrieken\n    - Test #11113\n  - [x] Support multiple edits for a completion item allowing languages such as Java and C# to automatically add imports #6874 @jrieken\n    - Test #11111\n- Terminal \n  - [x] Expose API to run a command in the terminal #9957 @Tyriar\n    - Test #11133\n- Extension doc \n  - [ ] Add the Language Extension Checklist to our docs @kieferrm\n### Engineering\n- [x] Debt: Refactor editor action/command enablement @alexandrudima \n- [x] Add coverage reports to the VS Code builds @alexandrudima \n- [x] API - Support programmatic cancellation of quick box @jrieken\n  - Test #11110\n- [x] Debt: Suggest support, handle incomplete result sets and cleanup.\n- [x] Configuration settings - refactor the service to enable write access as an API #8937 @bpasero\n  - Test #11023\n- [x] Editor - extract more colors defined by the editor as custom settings in themes #11095 @sandy081\n  - Test #11126\n  - [x] Release notes\n- [x] Electron investigate into adoption of latest version #10206 @bpasero\n  - we will not switch to a new version of Electron in August\n- Extensions:\n  - [x] Adopt the installation performance improvements from the Market place #10180 @joaomoreno\n  - [x] Extension details view: show more information about an installed extension  #10366 @joaomoreno\n    - Test #11118\n  - [x] Provide command to update all out of date extensions #8124  @joaomoreno\n    - Test #11119\n  - [x] Support other sorting orders in the extensions viewlet #8022 @joaomoreno\n    - Test #11120\n  - [x] Provide an option to automatically update outdated extensions @joaomoreno\n    - Test #11119\n- Debug:\n  - [x] incorporate debug protocol additions [backlog](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22protocol+extension%22+milestone%3A%22August+2016%22) @weinand\n    - [x] support for intellisense https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/issues/48\n      - Test #10997\n    - [x] support for launching debuggee in VS Code terminal https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-debugadapter-node/issues/47\n    - [x] Release notes\n  - [x] Implement debug target launching in integrated terminal #10574 @isidorn @weinand\n    - Test #11091\n    - [x] Release notes\n  - [x] Node debugging - continue investigate into supporting/switching to the Chrome Debugger Protocol that comes with node 7.0 https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-node-cdp-debug/issues/1 @weinand\n  - [x] Multi line debug repl input #8115\n    - Test #10996\n    - [x] Release notes\n  - [x] Multi-level chunking of large arrays @isidorn\n    - Test #10995\n    - [x] Release notes\n- Integrated Terminal - Continue to work on the Integrated Terminal backlog #9959 @Tyriar.
