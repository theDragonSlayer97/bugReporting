.NET debugging, we currently need to have the user manually create a tasks.json in order to support build. We would like to find some solution to avoid the user needing to do this manually. \n\nA few options:\n1. Support simple shell commands directly inside of launch.json. So if all the user wants to do is execute a command with a default error syntax they don't need this extra file. Example:\n   \"preLaunchCommand\": \"dotnet compile\"\nWhich would execute 'dotnet compile' in the workspace directory.\n-or-\n2. Support auto-generating a tasks.json when creating launch.json. This way we can give them a good default value of it and the user doesn't need to manually enter it.\n-or-\n3. Support defining tasks in an extension's package.json.

I was expecting it to act on the entire line's text regardless of where on the line the cursor was.\n\nUsing version 0.10.6, commit a80232bbcfe8a5cdad1ebc98638673d9dcb02458. There are no errors in the developer console and I have no extensions (besides the test extension and what VS Code comes with) installed or running.\n\nReproduction steps:\n1) Create a basic TypeScript extension. I made mine using the Yeoman generator.\n2) Set it up so it adds a new language and activates when that language is selected.\n3) Set that language's configuration on activation, using these indentation rules:\n\n``` typescript\nindentationRules: {\n    decreaseIndentPattern: /^\\s*outdent\\s*$/,\n    increaseIndentPattern: /^\\s*indent\\s*/,\n}\n```\n\n4) Run the extension and select the language.\n5) Type `indent` into the file (or otherwise indent)\n6) Type `outdent` on a new line and press enter with the text cursor at the end of the text. Observe that it does _not_ outdent.\n7) Type `outdent` on another indented line and press enter with the cursor _before_ the text. Observe that it does outdent as expected.\n\nI threw together an [example extension](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=8F34C5E85B8C95C!25522&authkey=!AI-4rLegxUxVEFA&ithint=file%2czip) that shows this issue.
