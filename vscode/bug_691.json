Really starting to like VSCode over Sublime. Slow going but I'm getting there! \r\n\r\nOne thing I really, really miss is goto anything, particularly as it pertains to sass / css writing.  In Sublime, I just do `goto anything`, and start typing the css classname I'm looking to edit and it brings instances of that selector in all files.

In a JavaScript file, type a statement containing a division operation (`/`) followed by a RegExp literal (`/.*/`) as part of the same statement e.g. `var v = (a / b).toString().match(/\\d*(\\.\\d+)?/)`\r\n2. The code highlighter does not highlight the statement properly e.g. in the example provided in step 1, the code highlighter thinks that the `/` in `a / b` is where the RegExp literal `/\\d*(\\.\\d+)?/` starts from and highlights the whole `/ b).toString().match(/\\d*(\\.\\d+)?/` part one RegExp literal.\r\n3. The same behaviour does not exhibit if the RegExp precedes a division operator in a similar fashion, e.g. in the statement `var v = parseFloat(s.match(/\\d*(\\.\\d+)?/).toString(), 10) / 2.5`, the same RegExp literal is highlighted properly.\r\n\r\n**Example:** (recreated from the \"Steps to Reproduce\" section)\r\n![20160111-06-16060158-9091](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4042217/20034648/9d651f02-a3e6-11e6-9a14-f010339b3437.png)\r\n\r\n**Another example:** (this one is caught in the wild, free-range and organic)\r\n![20160911-06-16060950-4ea9](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4042217/20034666/d7f20968-a3e7-11e6-81ef-bc6776df1242.png)\r\n\r\nPlease forgive the obscene, blasphemic JavaScript in the above example(s?). The point is, it's syntactically valid. Also, in my experience, this did not happen before the recent VSCode upgrade to 1.7.1 so I'm presuming this relates to something that was changed in 1.7.1.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15050","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15050/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15050/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15050/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/15050","id":187530746,"number":15050,"title":"Cache release notes.

But then editor window becoming too narrow.\r\nAt the same time it's completely useless to have such wide view for explorer, git or search.\r\nSo, You have to drag or toggle sidebar every time when you need to debug.\r\nIf you have monitor that something less than 1080p it leads to real problems in usability.\r\n\r\nThe best solution in my opinion is to make at least debugger view detachable. Such approach is very convenient to use with dual-monitor configuration.\r\n\r\nOther solution is to optionally move this watcher view to bottom panel where debug console located. Maybe it'll hard to use with debug console at the same time but JetBrains IDEs uses similar layout and it works fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15038/reactions","total_count":15,"+1":15,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15037","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15037/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15037/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15037/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15037","id":187496812,"number":15037,"title":"DVORAK
