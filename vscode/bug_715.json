'Uninteresting code' is code that is generated by a transpiling process but is not covered by a source map so it does not map back to the original source.

At this point you would expect the Play button to appear, instead the Pause button appears.

item for #14296.\n- [x] any OS @bpasero\n- [x] any OS @octref \n\ncomplexity: 4\n\nThe TypeScript language server in VS Code is used to provide intellisense within Javascript files. For VS Code 1.7, we switched to v2.0.6 of the TypeScript language server. v2.0.6 monitors the `package.json` files and installs for all dependencies the most recent, available typing files in a global cache on the file system. On macOs the cache is at `~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/TypeScript/node_modules/@types`.\n\nTest Scenarios:\n1. Write a small node.js application from scratch in JavaScript.\n2. Clone an existing node.js application written in JavaScript and modify it.\n\nWhile editing the application's JS files you should get meaningful intellisense proposals for node and it's built-in modules as well as any module your application depends on.\n\nNotes:\n1. Before each of the tests, clear the cache location to make sure that a populated cache does not hide a situation in which the automated acquisition of typing files fails.\n2. Test with autosave enabled and disabled.\n3. Ensure that you also run `npm install` when you make changes to the `package.json` file. An increasing number of node modules includes the typings file directly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14328/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14327","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14327/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14327/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14327/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14327","id":184954628,"number":14327,"title":"Test

ESLint auto fix on save.\n- [x] Any platform @rebornix \n\nComplexity - 2\n\nvscode-eslint is now supporting autofix on save:\n- The setting is enabled using `eslint.autoFixOnSave`. Notice that the setting is only honored when `autoSave` is not set to `after delay`.\n### Set up\n- install the latest version of the vscode-eslint extension (version 1.0.8)\n- create a new workspace with eslint install (npm install eslint). Also create a .eslintrc file\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"env\": {\n        \"commonjs\": true,\n        \"es6\": true,\n        \"node\": true\n    },\n    \"rules\": {\n        \"no-const-assign\": \"warn\",\n        \"no-this-before-super\": \"warn\",\n        \"no-undef\": \"warn\",\n        \"no-unreachable\": \"warn\",\n        \"no-unused-vars\": \"warn\",\n        \"constructor-super\": \"warn\",\n        \"valid-typeof\": \"warn\",\n        \"no-extra-semi\": \"warn\"\n    }\n}\n```\n- file issues here: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint\n### Test\n- ensure that you have auto save after delay disabled\n- ensure that you have format on save disabled.\n- create a JS file and add an extra semicolon. It should be removed on save. \n- test other ESLint warnings that offer a auto fix. See rules with a wrench here: http://eslint.org/docs/rules/. Please note that some rules need an n pass fix approach which is currently not implemented yet. So only test one rule at a time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14319/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14318","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14318/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14318/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14318/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14318","id":184926608,"number":14318,"title":"Test: Atom Keymap extension","user":{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/29","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/29","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/29/labels","id":2019000,"number":29,"title":"October 2016","description":"","creator":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":448,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-09-21T11:16:13Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T08:17:55Z","due_on":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-11-02T19:54:13Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-10-24T19:03:30Z","updated_at":"2016-10-25T16:35:28Z","closed_at":"2016-10-25T16:35:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Test for [Atom Keymap Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.atom-keybindings)\n- [x] macOS @aeschli \n- [x] Windows @isidorn \n- [x] Linux @Tyriar \n\nTest Details\n1.

tsserver we ship out of the box with VS Code got upgraded to 2.0.6. Since 2.0.6 has API changes the code talking to the tsserver is now version aware. We therefore need to sanity check the TS features against a 1.8.10, a 2.0.3 and the shipped 2.0.6 version.\n- [x] 1.8.10 -  @mousetraps\n- [x] 2.0.3 -  @roblourens \n- [x] 2.0.6 - @egamma \n\nComplexity: 4\n## Feature testing\n- create a new workspace. If you test 1.8.10 or 2.0.3 install typescript into the workspace using npm install typescript@x.x.x and use the `typescript.tsdk` to point to the local tsserver directory.\n- test all TS functions like: error reporting, intellisense, goto definition, find references, format, format on type, hover, rename, document symbols and workspace symbols.\n- try things...\n- if you test the 2.0.6 version also test the following scenario: create a new workspace with two js files but no tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json. The two JS file should reference globals symbols from the other file but should not refer to the other file using /// reference statements or import statements. Open both files and trigger workspace symbols. Ensure that you see the symbols from both files. Also test find references on a symbol that is referenced in the other file\n- if the error is an 'obvious' TypeScript problem file the issue directly against the TS repository: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript.
