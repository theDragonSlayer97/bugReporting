VSCode Version: 1.13.1\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

Write some vala code with an error and compile it using a task with the problem matcher above.\r\n\r\n3. Observe that vscode marks one less character than the vala compiler output. For example, vscode only underlines `va` but the vala compiler underlines `var`.\r\n\r\n  ![selection_014](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/963645/27745356-9f50aa6e-5d88-11e7-9c63-4da9ee852c47.png)\r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nApparently, the vala compiler considers the end column inclusive while vscode considers it exclusive.

cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29958","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29958/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29958/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29958/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29958","id":239825282,"number":29958,"title":"[Important]

searched for open issues with \"scroll position\". I didn't find one that seemed related to this issue.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.13.1\r\n- OS Version: Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open two editors on the same file. The file should have enough contents that scrolling is necessary.\r\n2. Scroll editor A to the end of the file. Leave editor B scrolled to the top of the file.\r\n3. Add a new line to the file in editor B.\r\n\r\nNotice that when lines are added/removed to B, A scrolls accordingly. This defeats the purpose of two editors open on a (typically really long file), which is to work on two places within the file. I scroll editor A to one location of interest, and editor B to another. As long as there's enough scroll length, the editor which didn't receive the edits should maintain its scrolling position. Otherwise, what is scrolled into view will eventually end-up out of view (in the extreme case). Otherwise, it's visually annoying to see the other editor scrolling.\r\n\r\nBTW, Sublime Text handles this very nicely.\r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29954","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29954/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29954/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29954/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29954","id":239809920,"number":29954,"title":"Feature request: Option to fetch inside VS Code.

Configure \"files.autoSave\": \"afterDelay\", leave the default delay of 1000 ms.\r\n2. Initialize an empty git repository in the current directory\r\n3. Start editing a file, especially not under source control (so that there's no changed files and no git badge counter on the Source Control icon)\r\n4. Observe that about once every 5 seconds or so a clock badge briefly appears on the Source Control icon and, if you have Source Control panel open, the blue dash moves above the commit message field.\r\n\r\n![vscode-source-control-annoyance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/308111/27737578-4adbe786-5db1-11e7-94fb-25a893934196.gif)\r\n\r\nThats pretty annoying and distracting! It's less noticeable if you're editing a file under source control, since that \"in progress\" icon then doesn't appear out of the blue but replaces the number of changed files. It's also less noticeable when you don't have the source control panel open so there's no blue dash.\r\n\r\nThe cause is obvious: vscode saves the file you're actively working on every second, after some further delay the git plugin notices that something changed and asks git what exactly (which can be seen in the output console - Git) and while doing that indicates that it's busy.\r\n\r\nMaybe just don't do that? Just don't show the busy indicator when routinely rescanning the source folder? And when autofetching too, by the way, if it does that now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29945","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29945/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29945/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29945/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29945","id":239784039,"number":29945,"title":"Status bar background color is not being applied (themes and if explicitly set in settings.json)","user":{"login":"frankhale","id":190154,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/190154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale","html_url":"https://github.com/frankhale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankhale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-06-30T13:47:13Z","updated_at":"2017-06-30T14:26:45Z","closed_at":"2017-06-30T14:05:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.14.0-insider (7e2937237620501705e4a5276e76726d35a31905, 2017-06-30T05:17:53.525Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.15063\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
