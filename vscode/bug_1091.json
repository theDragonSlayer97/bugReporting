change will add a user setting that will allow to optout of reporting telemetry. The product will allow a set of predefined events to pass the user optin settings. This way we can calculate the optin rates. \n\nThe change include: \n- Refactor `ITelemetryConfiguration` from `mainTelemetryService` to `telemetry.ts`\n- Add a configuration option from the `ElectronTelemetryService`. This service will be responsible for caching the events that are reported until the user optin settings are loaded. After that, the service will flush the events. This is to prevent race conditions as some events are reported on load (auto save, workspace stats, workspace load). \n- Add a mechanism to allow for a predefined events to pass user optout settings

(For example, if Ubuntu were to decide to start shipping vscode.)\n\nCompared to the 0.10.8 (January) release of vscode, the oss build also includes vscode-api-tests, but it's removed in the release version, which makes sense.\n\nThe release version also includes jrieken.vscode-omnisharp, but the oss build doesn't.  (Not really sure why.  Probably an oversight?).\n\nAside from that, the only other difference I can find with the extensions is that the node-debug and mono-debug \"extensions\" in the oss build are just stub packages (node-debug-placeholder and mono-debug-placeholder).\n\nAs noted in [issue #60, comment 6](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60#issuecomment-161792005), the release ships with a different product.json.  Some of the differences are cosmetic, others fill in service endpoints.  Here are the most notable differences:\n- The extensionsGallery property is set in the release build.  Notable because it controls whether the \"Install Extensions\" item shows up in the command palette, and downstream packagers should set this to something appropriate if they want to enable extension downloads from within the product.\n- The dataFolderName is changed.  Notable because it controls where (some of) the user configuration and extensions are stored.  If the VSCODE_DEV environment variable is set, it will use the directory name obtained by appending \"-dev\" to the dataFolderName value.  (The vscode launch scripts for the oss build set VSCODE_DEV by default.)\n- crash reporting and telemetry are enabled in the release build.\n\nThis isn't an exhaustive listing, but it's not meant to be.  However, some document that includes this information needs to exist, and going ahead and mentioning it in this comment is a starting point.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3029/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3028","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3028/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3028/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3028/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3028","id":133771514,"number":3028,"title":"Path
