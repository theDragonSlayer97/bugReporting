For instance, I may be working on a long-term feature ticket on the server side of my app and have open our `server.js` and a few other files related to the issue. I then get a hotfix that I need to take care of on the client side and need to close those tabs, open another set of client-side code files to work on that hotfix, then go back and try to remember which files I had open for the long-term feature.\n\nIt would be useful to be able to save the tab set that I have open, switch to the new task and finish it up, then simply use that saved set to reopen those tabs and restore that workspace.\n\nInitial thoughts on feature requirements\n- Ability to save a tab set with a user-specified identifier (this would save the tabs and the tab ordering)\n- Ability to remove saved tab sets\n- Ability to rename saved tab sets (this may add unnecessary complexity for a v1 feature)\n- Menu for accessing the saved tabs, I'm thinking similar to switching files with `⌘/Ctrl+P` (maybe even use that same shortcut, since it's a sort of file-switching functionality)\n- When accessing a tab set, either completely ignore files that no longer exist, or give a user-facing warning that certain files were not found, but still open all remaining files.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13951/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13950","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13950/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13950/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13950/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13950","id":183747788,"number":13950,"title":"Search

The reason is this:\n\nLets say you have a configuration value that is meant to be a boolean. Some sort of true/false value for your extension. And then someone copies this configuration value over to their User Settings file but they accidentally change it to a string instead of a boolean.\n\nNow in your extension code, you need to obviously do a type check on the fetch configuration value to make sure it's a boolean. If it's not a boolean, you should probably fall back to the default value. But there is no way to fetch the default configuration value from the Default Settings. The only solution for this is to also hardcode your default value within your code and grab it from there.\n\nI can't see a way to grab default values from configuration, so it would be really nice to have this option.

I am not sure if it really is a bug, but nevertheless it would be a lot less confusing if the naming in that case would be more consistent.\n\nHence the request -- please rename the \"Restart\" parts in UI texts to \"Reload\". If no full restart is being done, then it makes no sense to name it as such.\n\nAlso, this proposed change would bring about another increase in consistency as there already is a \"Reload Window\" command which, at least on the surface, appears to do the very thing that is currently being disguised and labeled as a \"Restart\" in other parts of the UI.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13937","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13937/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13937/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13937/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13937","id":183671093,"number":13937,"title":"Editor becomes unresponsive after hover preview of very large variable","user":{"login":"jhsware","id":3896884,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3896884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsware","html_url":"https://github.com/jhsware","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsware/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsware/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsware/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsware/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsware/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsware/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsware/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsware/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsware/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-18T12:22:55Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T17:37:48Z","closed_at":"2016-10-18T17:37:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.5.3\n- OS Version: MacOS 10.11.6\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. assign a variable a large amount of binary data\n2. hover over the variable to get the preview\n\nVS Code gets unresponsive.

VSCode Version:\n  1.6.1\n- OS Version:\n  Ubuntu 16\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nI'm writing a VSCode extension and I'm trying to make the signature helper(parameter hints) kick in. I followed the docs and took inspiration also from 'vscode-golang' on how this should be implemented but this feature is still not triggered even when explicitly triggering it with 'ctrl+shift+space'\n1. I have the provider registered as:\n\n``` js\n vscode.languages.registerSignatureHelpProvider({ language: lang, scheme:\" file\" }, \n            new SignatureProvider(), '(', ','));\n```\n\nWhere lang is 'javascript' and 'javascriptreact'(iregistration happens in a loop).\n1. I have the provider implemented as:\n\n``` js\nimport * as vscode from 'vscode';\nexport default class SignatureProvider implements vscode.SignatureHelpProvider {\n    public provideSignatureHelp(\n        document: vscode.TextDocument,\n        position: vscode.Position,\n        token: vscode.CancellationToken\n    ):any {\n            const signatureHelp = new vscode.SignatureHelp(); // This line is never reached \n            console.log('Signature helper kicked in');\n            signatureHelp.activeParameter = 0;\n            signatureHelp.activeSignature = 0;\n            const sig = new vscode.SignatureInformation('param', 'great param');\n            sig.parameters = [new vscode.ParameterInformation('x', 'docs')];\n            signatureHelp.signatures = [sig];\n            return signatureHelp;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNo matter what i do, press 'ctrl+shift+space' or type in a method call the provider isn't triggered.\n\nAll of my other providers are triggered just fine as expected: hover provider, autocomplete provider
