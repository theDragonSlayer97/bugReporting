in this release, previously it relied on the standard Chromium web selection which featured many shortcomings with all the various tricks that were used to get a terminal working in a browser efficiently. This means that things that you may take for granted like word selection on double click+drag or line selection on triple click have been handled explicitly.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the things that need to be tested:\r\n\r\n- Copy works using various types of selections\r\n  - Single click and drag\r\n  - Double click\r\n  - Double click and drag\r\n  - Triple click\r\n  - Triple click and drag\r\n  - Selection using the mouse wheel to scroll the viewport\r\n  - Select all (via command palette or cmd+a on macOS)\r\n  - Select all and copy while the command is streaming in input and the buffer is being trimmed (when there are more lines than `terminal.integrated.scrollback`)\r\n- Paste\r\n- Selection works fine when starting from a link\r\n- Selection works fine when starting from text in the prompt\r\n- Selection is retained when the viewport is scrolled or a new command is run\r\n- Selection is drawn in the correct position with various `window.zoomLevel` values and monospace fonts\r\n- Context menu actions work (Copy, Paste, Select All)\r\n- Whitespace padding on the right of text should never be copied to the clipboard\r\n  - Copying the whitespace padding does does nothing\r\n  - Copying whitespace on the left or right of a word is retained \r\n- Linux specific:\r\n  - Select something outside of VS Code and middle click to paste the selection\r\n  - Select something in the VS Code editor and middle click to paste the selection\r\n  - Select in the VS Code terminal and middle click to paste the selection\r\n  - The new selection logic should be disabled

The file watcher can be enabled by using the setting `\"files.useExperimentalFileWatcher\": true`, or by just opening multiple folders.\r\n\r\nThe major test cases are highlighted above, make sure you refresh as you're checking a checkbox off to prevent update conflicts. Most of which will involve modifying a file and observing the file event propagates.\r\n\r\nYou can add a multi-root folder by opening a folder in VS Code and then using the `File: Add Root Folder...` command. This adds the relevant settings to your user settings. Also be sure to launch VS Code using `code-insiders --verbose` to get file watcher events in the devtools console, this will help verify events are firing correctly and will be very valuable in debugging issues. To verify you are using the new watcher, check the console for this entry:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/900690/27572043-e3f2a324-5b09-11e7-95d1-bf3cb219a8d2.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29477","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29477/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29477/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29477/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29477","id":238621980,"number":29477,"title":"Typescript
