I got this from the docs.\n4. Try to read the alert and fail :)\n\nExpected behavior:\n- The alert is read out loud or at least actionable using a screenreader.\n\nPerceived result:\n- The alert is not read, cannot be interacted with in any way I've been able to figure out and is not announced either.
