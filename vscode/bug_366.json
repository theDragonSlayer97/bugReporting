let me say I love VS Code. I love the velocity of the project. I love the monthly release plan and the cadence that it moves at.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't like is the *consumption* of these updates at an ever-increasing frequency as a user. The promise of Visual Studio Code is a release approximately once a month. But that's (understandably) not reality, because software has bugs and release have unexpected issues in the wild. Let me start with a summary of release history from the past 12 months to serve as data for discussion:\r\n\r\n| Month | Count | Releases | 1.\\*.0 to 1.\\*.1 release time span |\r\n|-|-|-|-|\r\n| Apr 2017 | 3 | [1.11.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.11.0), [1.11.1](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.11.1), [1.11.2](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.11.2) | 1 day |\r\n| Mar 2017 | 2 | [1.10.1](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.10.1), [1.10.2](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.10.2) | 1 day |\r\n| Feb 2017 | 3 | [1.9.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.9.0), [1.9.1](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.9.1), [1.10.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.10.0) | 6 days |\r\n| Jan 2017 | 0 | (n/a) | (n/a) |\r\n| Dec 2016 | 2 | [1.8.1](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.8.1), [1.8.2](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.8.2) | 1 day |\r\n| Nov 2016 | 3 | [1.7.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.7.0), [1.7.1](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.7.1), [1.7.2](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.7.2) | 2 days |\r\n| Oct 2016 | 2 | [1.6.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.6.0), [1.6.1](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.6.1) | 3 days |\r\n| Sep 2016 | 4 | [1.5.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.5.0), [1.5.1](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.5.1), [1.5.2](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.5.2), [1.5.3](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.5.3) | 0 days |\r\n| Aug 2016 | 1 | [1.4.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.4.0) | (n/a) |\r\n| Jul 2016 | 2 | [1.3.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.3.0), [1.3.1](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.3.1) | 5 days |\r\n| Jun 2016 | 2 | [1.2.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.2.0), [1.2.1](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.2.1) | 13 days |\r\n| May 2016 | 2 | [1.1.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.1.0), [1.1.1](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.1.1) | 7 days |\r\n\r\n<sub>[Data available in GitHub tags](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tags)</sub>\r\n\r\nCan we change how releases are consumed here? I don't think the \"stable\" channel is living up to the name from a user standpoint. I think the code is mostly stable, but not the *experience*. Users shouldn't get this many update prompts in the normal \"stable\" install.\r\n\r\nI propose the following requirements, as a user consuming updates:\r\n- Should not get a prompt to update **two days in a row** (this has happened many times)\r\n- Should not get a prompt to update more than once a week on a channel called \"stable\"\r\n\r\nA few ideas:\r\n- A \"slow\" channel, where releases are only posted if they has been no new release in the past 7 days. \r\n  - This would have eliminated the > 1 per month prompts for not-really-stable releases for 9 of the 10 months they happened in the table above.\r\n- Give users an option to configure a similar lag, not prompting for an update until it has been posted for at least 7 days and not obsoleted by a new point release.\r\n  - e.g. `update.delayDays`, which if configured to 7 days would have the same effect as above.\r\n- Make updates a background post-close operation, simply informing the user in a much more subtle way (0-clicks, auto-dismiss) that an update will occur on next restart automatically.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is VS code is a means to an end. I'm trying to do work, and so is everyone else. Update prompts, especially repetitive ones in a short duration get in the way of that and only add frustration. They rarely help me get any work done; it's usually the opposite.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Ideas? Can we improve this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24823/reactions","total_count":26,"+1":26,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24822","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24822/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24822/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24822/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24822","id":221946464,"number":24822,"title":"Issue","user":{"login":"celverbamboo","id":24216880,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/24216880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/celverbamboo","html_url":"https://github.com/celverbamboo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celverbamboo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celverbamboo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celverbamboo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celverbamboo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celverbamboo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celverbamboo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celverbamboo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celverbamboo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celverbamboo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":386618042,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs

VSCode Version: `1.11.2`\r\n- OS Version: `macOS 10.12.4`\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open integrated terminal\r\n2. `cat` a file with a lot of unicode. I found it with [this](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform-cli/blob/master/src/commands/validate.js) file, but anything with a lot of printed unicode (eg `validate\\n#Validating project locally.\\n#\\n# \\u250C\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500 ...` should work\r\n\r\nThe terminal window is unable to scroll while the unicode characters are visible. When it does recover, it scrolls normally when looking at previous lines. Scrolling down to the unicode block hangs it again.\r\n\r\nRepro Rate: 100%\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24795/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4996","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"E349:2488B:35AA22B:46282C4:59D93801","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=367>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=365>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"a65adfbc86a8c416a5ce646c7fe5aef8\"","status":"200 OK"}}
