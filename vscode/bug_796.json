If it's expected, is showing this runtime here useful to the extension user?

Check out https://github.com/MSLaguana/vscode_deactivate_process_issue\n2. Run the extension in that project\n3. In the command palette, run \"Spawn child process\"\n4. Navigate to `localhost:8080` and verify that a webserver is running\n5. In the command palette, run \"Kill child process\"\n6. Navigate to `localhost:8080` and verify that no webserver is running; the cleanup command works correctly.\n7. In the command palette, run \"Spawn child process\", then close the experimental vscode instance\n8. Navigate to `localhost:8080` and verify that the webserver is still running\n\nWe ran into this issue at https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-native/issues/300 where during normal usage of the extension, we start a long-running child process which we want to clean up when the extension stops.\n\nSpecifically we are trying to run `child_process.spawn(\"react-native.cmd\", ...)`, which ends up creating an instance of `cmd /c react-native.cmd` that in turn creates the desired `node cli.js ...`. We would like to make sure that descendant process is cleaned up, but because there is an extra layer of indirection we cannot simply call `child_proc.kill()` since that kills the `cmd` process but not the `node` process.\n\nTo work around this, on windows we use `taskkill /T` to kill the `cmd` process and all its descendants. This works fine during normal operation, but when the extension is terminating invoking `taskkill` is an async exec operation and so it does not complete. I also tried using `exec-sync` but that didn't help either.\n\nAny suggestions on how to improve our behaviour here instead of leaking processes?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11894","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11894/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11894/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11894/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11894","id":176428280,"number":11894,"title":"Integrated

This would be very helpful, since terminal and errors are usually needed together - you type some code and see compilation notes in terminal.

VSCode Version: 1.5.1\n- OS Version: OS-X 10.11.6\n\nCurrently, the configuration switches that control indentation (editor.tabSize, editor.insertSpaces) can be configured globally or per-workspace.  But it's not unusual to work on different types of files within the same workspace that need different indentation styles.  For example, Go source files always use tabSize=8, insertSpaces=false (it's a language standard), but the same workspaces very often contain other types of files (e.g. Markdown, HTML, JavaScript, etc.) where those are not the desired settings.  It is irritating to have to set the indentation style manually whenever creating a new file.  Instead, the indentation settings should be language-specific, rather like snippets.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11879/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":14,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11878","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11878/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11878/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11878/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11878","id":176350358,"number":11878,"title":".JS files no longer open as Javascript after latest update","user":{"login":"mostergaard","id":8314260,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8314260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostergaard","html_url":"https://github.com/mostergaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostergaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostergaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostergaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostergaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostergaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostergaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostergaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostergaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostergaard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-09-12T11:13:30Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T13:59:50Z","closed_at":"2016-09-13T13:13:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.5.1 (07d663dc1bd848161edf4cd4ce30cce410d3d877, 2016-09-08T21:33:49.307Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open a .js file\n2. In the bottom-right corner it appears as \"Plain Text\"\n3. If I click on the \"Plain Text\" link and choose \"Configure File Association for '.js'\" a settings.json tab appears. I can click save, but it doesn't appear to have any effect.\n\nSo now I need to manually choose \"JavaScript\" for each .js file I open.\nThe project I work with also have JavaScript React files (.jsx) and they correctly open as React.\n\nThis used to work with the previous version and only started appearing as I upgraded to 1.5.1.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4566","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"B10A:366F:CAD0FF:18C3250:59D94166","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=797>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=795>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"411fb9ade1474d5cd39186198f230b69\"","status":"200 OK"}}
