Am I using `outFiles` wrong?\r\nMy problem feels kind of similar to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13499 but none of the suggested solutions there solved my issue.\r\nIs there anything I can provide to help diagnose/troubleshoot this?

VSCode Version: 1.7.1\r\n- OS Version: Win10\r\n\r\nWith the new command line options for Windows integrated terminal, it now is finally possible to start a proper working Cygwin terminal in the current project. GREAT!\r\n\r\nFor that you need to have base Cygwin and the `chere` package installed. There is not need to run the chere command and integrate Cygwin with your Explorer. The chere package is just needed for the `/bin/xhere` command that comes with it.\r\n\r\nWhen you only use `C:\\\\Cygwin\\\\bin\\\\bash.exe` (so without these command line options) the Cygwin path is not set properly and bash is useless. And when you start `C:\\\\Cygwin\\\\Cygwin.bat` your path is set, but you end up in `$HOME` and not in the right directory.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Install base Cygwin and add the `chere` package. (You might have to start Cygwin once to initialize it, not sure)\r\n2. Add these lines to the Workbench Settings:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n// Cygwin, with chere package installed\r\n\"terminal.integrated.shell.windows\": \"C:\\\\Cygwin\\\\bin\\\\bash.exe\",\r\n\"terminal.integrated.shellArgs.windows\": [\"/bin/xhere\", \"/bin/bash\"],\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Open the terminal in VSCode and see a proper working Cygwin terminal (apart from #7345) appear in the current directory. In doubt type `uname -a`.\r\n\r\nSo please add the three lines above to
