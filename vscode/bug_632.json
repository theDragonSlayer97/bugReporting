VSCode Version: 1.8.0 Insiders\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nUnlike the website key binding rendering which returns \"unassigned\" for missing command key bindings, the in-product rendering simply returns the command id string.  To workaround this, we've been manually setting the key binding to \"unassigned\" in Markdown. This is a poor workaround when a key binding exists for some platforms (ex. Linux) but not others.\r\n\r\nPerhaps getKeybindingLabel() could be changed to return \"unassigned\" instead of 0 for missing key bindings. Note that getKeybindingLabel() is used through out the product so care should be taken that a change doesn't cause a regression somewhere else.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16829","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16829/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16829/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16829/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16829","id":194082303,"number":16829,"title":"Hot

Or create a new menu in the Bar Menu by relocating some items.\r\n\r\n![capturar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19866231/20972496/256de890-bc7c-11e6-8222-0a40fb412090.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16826/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16825","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16825/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16825/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16825/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16825","id":194068695,"number":16825,"title":"save
