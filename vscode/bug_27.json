for: #34218\r\nComplexity: 4\r\n\r\n- [ ] Linux - @joaomoreno \r\n\r\nWe have added *proposed* API for file system provider. They allow you add a new root node to the explorer (currently implemented as adding a workspace folder), allow for file creation/discovery/saving etc. \r\n\r\nFor testing, write a file system provider. To keep things simple, I suggest to implement a \"localhost\"-provider, that represents files on your computer and uses the node API. A sample of an FTP provider is here: https://github.com/jrieken/ftp-sample. You are obviously free to take a more complex sample, like `tar`-files or `ssh` but at the risk of spending much time understanding how the backends work\r\n\r\n1. Note that you need to register your provider for a [scheme](https://github.com/jrieken/ftp-sample/blob/276615f7814e3a250473eeba65d345654153a164/src/extension.ts#L13) and that your provider needs to provide a [root](https://github.com/jrieken/ftp-sample/blob/276615f7814e3a250473eeba65d345654153a164/src/extension.ts#L26)\r\n2. Note that your extension needs to use a new (and undocumented) activation event which is [`onFileSystemAccess:<your_scheme>`](https://github.com/jrieken/ftp-sample/blob/276615f7814e3a250473eeba65d345654153a164/package.json#L14)\r\n\r\nThis is feature ready and all done but the purpose is to that we have the right abstraction that allows you feed (remote) files into the editor. \r\n\r\n* Test that your root and its children show up and can be browsed \r\n* That that your provider isn't called like crazy\r\n* Test that you get called to modify files (contents, times, etc)\r\n* Test that your files feel like normal files but that certain operations (like reveal in finder) aren't available ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35008","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35008/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35008/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35008/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35008","id":260494300,"number":35008,"title":"Provide a way to prevent popups when typing.","user":{"login":"rbiggs","id":249218,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/249218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs","html_url":"https://github.com/rbiggs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbiggs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-09-26T05:22:01Z","updated_at":"2017-09-27T15:38:32Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.16.1 (1.16.1)\r\n- OS Version: macOS Sierra 10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\nThere is currently no way to prevent popups from appearing as one types.

You should provide some kind of setting to prevent all popups for when users want/need to type without the distractions of popups. \r\n\r\nMy current user settings are as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"editor.fontSize\": 12,\r\n    \"editor.tabSize\": 2,\r\n    \"editor.wordWrap\": \"on\",\r\n    \"css.validate\": false,\r\n    \"editor.fontFamily\": \"SF Mono, monospace\",\r\n    \"editor.quickSuggestions\": {\r\n      \"other\": false,\r\n      \"comments\": false,\r\n      \"strings\": false,\r\n      \"editor.wordBasedSuggestions\": false\r\n    },\r\n    \"editor.quickSuggestionsDelay\": 1000000,\r\n    \"editor.minimap.enabled\": false,\r\n    \"editor.fontLigatures\": true,\r\n    \"editor.wordBasedSuggestions\": false,\r\n    \"editor.hover\": false,\r\n    \"explorer.openEditors.visible\": 0,\r\n    \"explorer.autoReveal\": false,\r\n    \"emmet.syntaxProfiles\": {\r\n         \"typescript\": \"html\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"emmet.includeLanguages\": {\"javascript\":\"javascriptreact\"},\r\n    \"workbench.startupEditor\": \"newUntitledFile\",\r\n    \"window.zoomLevel\": 0\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nHere's an image of what I'm talking about:\r\n\r\n![vscode-popups](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/249218/30843691-b9d84792-a23f-11e7-86c1-caa0b9156028.png)\r\n\r\nThe popup \"Component(props: any)...\" is exactly over the area I need to type in. I do not need to see this popup about the call signature every time I try to add a member to the class.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35007","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35007/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35007/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35007/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35007","id":260491515,"number":35007,"title":"markdown snippets unavailable","user":{"login":"builden","id":9499016,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9499016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/builden","html_url":"https://github.com/builden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/builden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/builden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/builden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/builden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/builden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/builden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/builden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/builden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/builden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":299344519,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/markdown","name":"markdown","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-09-26T04:59:26Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T06:59:54Z","closed_at":"2017-10-02T06:59:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

\r\n\r\nI have a question more than an issue about `CompletionItem`. \r\nI posted also on stack overflow but unfortunately the community is not still so active so just few views and no comments/answers. \r\n\r\nHow would it be possible to run a defined CompletionItem from a keybinding in vscode please? I tried to find it through official documentation and samples, but no luck so far.\r\n\r\nSo suppose I have this CompletionItem defined in my extension:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlanguages.registerCompletionItemProvider('plaintext', {\r\n  provideCompletionItems(document: TextDocument, position: Position) {\r\n    var completionItems: CompletionItem[] = [];\r\n    var completionItem: CompletionItem = new CompletionItem(\"id\");\r\n    completionItem.detail = \"sample\";\r\n    completionItem.filterText = \"test\";\r\n    completionItem.insertText = \"blablabla\";\r\n    completionItem.label = \"test\";\r\n    completionItems.push(completionItem);\r\n    return completionItems;\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow can I trigger the defined CompletionItem through a keybinding?\r\n\r\nAt the moment what I did is to bind to a command in the package.json:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"keybindings\": [{\r\n  \"command\": \"helloworldextension.test\",\r\n  \"key\": \"ctrl+alt+q\",\r\n  \"mac\": \"cmd+alt+q\",\r\n  \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\"\r\n}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then I defined the command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet sub = context.subscriptions;\r\ncommands.registerCommand('helloworldextension.test', testCommand);\r\nfunction testCommand() {\r\n  // here I would like to trigger my CompletionItem\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried the following:\r\n\r\n`commands.executeCommand('vscode.executeCompletionItemProvider', uri, position);`\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't work and I didn't understand how to trigger my CompletionItem and what to pass in the method\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for any help!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34999","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34999/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34999/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34999/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34999","id":260430322,"number":34999,"title":"Clean-up

For each property of each event it adds what kind of data they contain and for what reason the data is collected.\r\n\r\n# How the annotations work\r\n\r\nLet's assume we send the following event and the timer data is dynamic, i.e. the properties of `timer` can not known statically:\r\n```ts\r\nlogEvent('E1', {\r\n    E1P1: 'activitybar',\r\n    ...f1,\r\n    ...f4,\r\n    timer: {\r\n        waited: 536,\r\n        processing: 43,\r\n        queued: 97,\r\n        elasped: 812\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe event is constructed in multiple steps, normally scattered across several files:\r\n```ts\r\nfunction logEvent(eventName, eventData) {\r\n    eventData.CP1 = getSQMUserId();\r\n    service.sendEvent(eventName, eventData);\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet f1 : F1 = { F1P1 : 23 };\r\n\r\nlet f2 : F2 = { F2P1 : document.getLine(1) };\r\n \r\nlet f3 : F3 = { F3P1: publisher.displayName };\r\n\r\nlet f4 : F4 = {\r\n    F4P1: extension.extensionName,\r\n    F4P2: {\r\n        ...f2,\r\n        ...f3\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nlogEvent('E1', {\r\n    E1P1: 'activitybar',\r\n    ...f1,\r\n    ...f4,\r\n    timer: {\r\n        waited: 536,\r\n        processing: 43,\r\n        queued: 97,\r\n        elasped: 812\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to extract the event descriptions with simple scanners we use specific comments to describe telemetry events and their properties. We place those comments as close as possible to where the events and properties are generated. The code above would be annotated as follows:\r\n```ts\r\n// __GDPR__COMMON__ \"CP1\" : { \"endPoint\": \"SqmUserId\", \"classification\": \"EndUserPseudonymizedInformation\", \"purpose\": \"BusinessInsight\" }\r\nfunction logEvent(eventName, eventData) {\r\n    eventData.CP1 = getSQMUserId();\r\n    service.sendEvent(eventName, eventData);\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* __GDPR__FRAGMENT__\r\n   \"F1\" : {\r\n      \"F1P1\": { \"classification\": \"SystemMetaData\", \"purpose\": \"FeatureInsight\" }\r\n   }\r\n */\r\nlet f1 : F1 = { F1P1 : 23 };\r\n\r\n/* __GDPR__FRAGMENT__\r\n   \"F2\" : {\r\n      \"F2P1\" : { \"classification\": \"CustomerContent\", \"purpose\": \"PerformanceAndHealth\" }\r\n   }\r\n */\r\nlet f2 : F2 = { F2P1 : document.getLine(1) };\r\n \r\n/* __GDPR__FRAGMENT__\r\n   \"F3\" : {\r\n      \"F3P1\" : { \"classification\": \"PublicPersonalData\", \"purpose\": \"FeatureInsight\" }\r\n   }\r\n */\r\nlet f3 : F3 = { F3P1: publisher.displayName };\r\n\r\n/* __GDPR__FRAGMENT__\r\n   \"F4\" : {\r\n      \"F4P1\" : { \"classification\": \"PublicNonPersonalData\", \"purpose\": \"FeatureInsight\" },\r\n      \"F4P2\": { \r\n          \"${inline}\": [\r\n              \"${F2}\",\r\n              \"${F3}\"\r\n            ] \r\n        }\r\n   }\r\n */\r\nlet f4 : F4 = {\r\n    F4P1: extension.extensionName,\r\n    F4P2: {\r\n        ...f2,\r\n        ...f3\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\n/* __GDPR__\r\n   \"E1\" : {\r\n      \"E1P1\" : { \"classification\": \"SystemMetaData\", \"purpose\": \"FeatureInsight\" },\r\n      \"${include}\": [ \r\n          \"${F1}\",\r\n          \"${F4}\"\r\n        ],\r\n      \"${wildcard}\": [\r\n         {\r\n            \"${prefix}\": \"timer.\",\r\n            \"${classification}\": { \"classification\": \"SystemMetaData\", \"purpose\": \"FeatureInsight\" }\r\n         }\r\n      ]\r\n   }\r\n */\r\nlogEvent('E1', {\r\n    E1P1: 'activitybar',\r\n    ...f1,\r\n    ...f4,\r\n    timer: {\r\n        waited: 536,\r\n        processing: 43,\r\n        queued: 97,\r\n        elasped: 812\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe comments are processed and result in the following \"final\" description of the `E1` event. Every property that starts with `timer.` such as `timer.waited` is classified as system metadata that is collected for gaining insights into how the feature is being used.\r\n```json\r\n   \"E1\" : {\r\n      \"E1P1\" : { \"classification\": \"SystemMetaData\", \"purpose\": \"FeatureInsight\" },\r\n      \"F1P1\": { \"classification\": \"SystemMetaData\", \"purpose\": \"FeatureInsight\" },\r\n      \"F4P4\" : { \"classification\": \"PublicNonPersonalData\", \"purpose\": \"FeatureInsight\" },\r\n      \"F4P2.F2P1\" : { \"classification\": \"CustomerContent\", \"purpose\": \"PerformanceAndHealth\" },\r\n      \"F4P2.F3P1\" : { \"classification\": \"PublicPersonalData\", \"purpose\": \"FeatureInsight\" },\r\n      \"${wildcard}\": [\r\n         {\r\n            \"${prefix}\": \"timer.\",\r\n            \"${classification}\": { \"classification\": \"SystemMetaData\", \"purpose\": \"FeatureInsight\" }\r\n         }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"CP1\" : { \"endPoint\": \"SqmUserId\", \"classification\": \"EndUserPseudonymizedInformation\", \"purpose\": \"BusinessInsight\" }\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\n# More about the syntax\r\nAll GDPR comments are tagged with one of the following tags and are otherwise well-formed `JSON`.\r\n- `__GDPR__` - describes the name and the properties of a telemetry event\r\n- `__GDPR__FRAGMENT__` - describes the name and the properties of a fragment of the data of an event, fragments are either included or inlined by other fragments or events\r\n- `__GDPR_COMMON__` - describes a property added to every telemetry event\r\n\r\nEach property is described with an object that looks like this: \r\n```ts\r\n{ \r\n    endPoint?: \"none\" | \"SqmUserId\" | \"SqmMachineId\",\r\n    classification: \"SystemMetaData\" | \"CustomerContent\" | \"EndUserPseudonymizedInformation\" | \"PublicPersonalData\" | \"PublicNonPersonalData\",\r\n    purpose: \"FeatureInsight\" | \"PerformanceAndHealth\" | \"BusinessInsight\" | \"SecurityAndAuditing\",\r\n    isMeasurement?: Boolean\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `endPoint` is omitted, it defaults to `none`. That's appropriate for pretty much all properties with the exception of a couple of common properties.\r\n\r\nThe values for `classification` are mostly self-explaining. `EndUserPseudonymizedInformation` is what allows us to identify if two separate actions are performed by the same user, although we don't know who the user is. `machineId` or `instanceId` fall in this category. `PublicPersonalData` and `PublicNonPersonalData` is information that users provide us with, for example, publisher information on the marketplace. `CustomerContent` is information the user generated such as urls of repositories or custom snippets. Everything else is `SystemMetaData`.\r\n\r\n`purpose` is usually `FeatureInsight` or `PerformanceAndHealth`. Only events generated by NPS surveys are sent to gain `BusinessInsight`.\r\n\r\n`isMeasurement` is only used when describing properties that are added as custom measurements to events sent by VS Code extensions. \r\n\r\n## Special constructs\r\n#### ${include}\r\nIf A includes B, this is equivalent to the union of A and B. Fragments are referenced using `${FragmentName}`.\r\n\r\n#### ${inline}\r\nIf A inlines B at property P, all properties of B are added to A under the key `\"P.<Name in B>\"`. Fragments are referenced using `${FragmentName}`.\r\n\r\n#### ${wildcard}\r\nWildcards can be used as a **temporary** workaround to describe dynamic properties that have a common prefix. In the long run all dynamic properties need to be removed and be sent as values of a static property. A wild card is an array of wildcard entries. Each entry has a `${prefix}` and a `${classification}` property. The value of `${prefix}` is a string representing the common prefix of all properties it matches. The value of `${classification}` is a property description detailed above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34996","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34996/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34996/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34996/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34996","id":260420347,"number":34996,"title":"Test
