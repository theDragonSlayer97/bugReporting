I posted this issue just now in response to trying to find out what the API has to offer with respect to some ideas I have. Key questions in mind are \"is it directly capable of X\" and \"can I get a sense of how much additional work would be required to extend certain base features to support my ideas?\"\n\nProblems:\n- It's a giant scrolling page; clumping everything together makes it hard to differentiate between different sections and judge how they relate to each other.\n- There is nowhere to get a quick overview of everything the API has to offer.\n- There is no obvious table of contents that I can use to quickly jump to the section I need.\n- There is no clear document hierarchy.\n- I can't quickly search for symbols and drill down to find what I need (other than via CTRL+F)\n- It's not very readable. The typography makes everything look kind of \"same-ish\", so it's hard to scroll through and scan for what I need. The font sizes don't make a lot of sense with respect to representing importance of items and their relationship to the document hierarchy.\n- Weird line spacing- way more space between property list items than headings and so forth. Again, scannability is an issue.\n\nWould love to see this presented in a way that encourages better absorption and exploration of what the API has to offer, and I'm sure doing so would promote a faster-growing extension ecosystem.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/298883/19334565/13ad6778-9140-11e6-8c84-58009ad59729.png)\n\nAs an aside; \"Complex Commands API\" - The intro text is completely unhelpful: _\"They are called complex commands because they require parameters and often return a value\"_ - this is a description of almost every function in

([platformio/pty.js](https://github.com/platformio/pty.js)) of a fork ([jeremyramin/pty.js](https://github.com/jeremyramin/pty.js)) of the original ([chjj/pty.js](https://github.com/chjj/pty.js)) 😕 and it probably doesn't have to be.\r\n- The original is not really maintained anymore.\r\n- ~~The current commit being used is on a branch called prebuilt but the prebuilt assets were removed to get signing working on [Tyriar/pty.js](https://github.com/Tyriar/pty.js).~~ The prebuilt branch was copied over the master branch https://github.com/Tyriar/pty.js/tree/master\r\n- All versions of pty.js depends on a fork ([peters/winpty](https://github.com/peters/winpty)) of a very old version of [rprichard/winpty](https://github.com/rprichard/winpty) which includes quite a few changes, including changes to the API. I believe this old version of winpty is the root cause for several [windows-specific terminal issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aintegrated-terminal+label%3Abug+label%3Awindows).\r\n- We should publish to Tyriar/pty.js to npm, particularly since it [now has more consumers](https://github.com/zeit/hyper/pull/946) than just vscode https://github.com/Tyriar/pty.js/issues/9","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13625/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13624","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13624/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13624/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13624/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13624","id":182607639,"number":13624,"title":"Incorrect syntax highlighting in method when its return type ends with a digit","user":{"login":"muhamedparic","id":17408083,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17408083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhamedparic","html_url":"https://github.com/muhamedparic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhamedparic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhamedparic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhamedparic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhamedparic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhamedparic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhamedparic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhamedparic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhamedparic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muhamedparic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-10-12T19:06:14Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T08:01:33Z","closed_at":"2016-10-13T08:01:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.6.0\n- OS Version: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit\n\n![52b3a02d1b41db8613640eebd5acfc47](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17408083/19323694/4bbc74e2-90be-11e6-8d01-b450afc2e573.png)\n![11084e2699fc5974741ae34d11117827](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17408083/19323699/4ea4a0ee-90be-11e6-8ae2-f63238dca1fe.png)\n\nIt seems to be caused by the return type ending in a digit (or multiple digits).
