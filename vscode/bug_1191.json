seeing some odd behavior around how threads are being rendered in the Code debugger for the Go debugger extension.  But I’m also not certain what I should be expecting to see, as I don’t think I’ve seen any examples of debuggers which show thread information in Code.\n\nThe Go debugger returns a list of threads from `DebugSession#threadsRequest`, but these are not displayed anywhere.  However, it seems that if I’ve ever hit a breakpoint on a different thread before, then later breakpoints will cause a second root node to appear in the Call Stack window showing the stacks associated with the 2 threads I've hit breakpoints on at some point (out of the 10 or so threads I’ve reported as existing).\n\nOn the thread that is not the active thread, the call stack displayed appears to be the call stack from the previous breakpoint I was at, not the active call stack on that thread at the current point.  And in fact, in both cases, my `DebugSession#stackTraceRequest` implementation is only being called once (for the thread the breakpoint was hit on), not for any of the other threads I reported.\n\nAfter hitting first breakpoint: \n![screen shot 2015-11-17 at 10 23 37 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/223467/11234157/f938e69e-8d79-11e5-8096-8cdf907aa2c1.png)\nAfter
