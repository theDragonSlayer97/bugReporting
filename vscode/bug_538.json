VSCode Version: 1.9.0 Insiders\r\n- OS Version: Mac OS and Windows OS\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis is breaking our [MSSQL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql) extension - we repeatedly call the `vscode.previewHtml` method when executing SQL queries, as it updates the results viewer with the latest results. It was working until the most recent Insiders build at which time it stopped resolving the promise and letting us hook in our code to update the result after it's been made visible and focused. Specific steps:\r\n\r\n1. Write an extension that uses vscode.previewHtml, e.g. \r\n\r\n```\r\nif (this.doesResultPaneExist(resultsUri)) {\r\n    // this is called for the 2nd call and all subsequent calls\r\n    // Implicity Use existing results window by not providing a pane\r\n    previewCommandPromise = vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.previewHtml', resultsUri, paneTitle);\r\n} else {\r\n    // This is called for the very first call\r\n    resultPaneColumn = this.newResultPaneViewColumn();\r\n    previewCommandPromise = vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.previewHtml', resultsUri, resultPaneColumn, paneTitle);\r\n}\r\n\r\npreviewCommandPromise.then(() => {\r\n    console.log('preview promise returned successfully');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Execute this logic more than once\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n- Each time the command is called, the .then logic gets executed and message is logged to the console\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n- The .then logic is only called the first time. For all calls when the preview tab is open, no callback happens which means logic meant to happen after it becomes visible is not called. In our case, this means we never update results which blocks our main scenario\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19653","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19653/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19653/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19653/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/19653","id":204470239,"number":19653,"title":"Remove

the legacy node debug protocol is on its way out, we need to continue preparing a seamless transition to the inspector debug protocol.\r\n\r\nStatus:\r\n- `node --debug` will print a deprecation message, probably in some 7.x release - https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/10970\r\n- In Node 8, sending a SIGUSR1 signal to a node process will switch it into debug mode using the inspector debug protocol - https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/8464\r\n- The legacy protocol is completely removed in V8 5.8 - https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/9789\r\n- It's not clear whether Node 8, released in probably April, will have V8 5.7 or 5.8. Seems likely that it will be 5.7 but we should be ready regardless - https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/10117\r\n\r\nPossible February plan:\r\n- Option 1:\r\n  - Wrap node and node2 in a single debug adapter. It checks the node version to be launched or attached to, and delegates to the proper debug adapter, using node2 when possible.\r\n  - It also registers 'node_legacy' to force the legacy debug adapter\r\n- Option 2:\r\n  - Change 'node' to detect the node version and warn the user to change the type to node2 if it's after 8\r\n  - Then at some point in the future, rename node2 to node\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have a seamless experience like in option 1 - a user doesn't care which debug protocol they use. That should be our job, if possible. There are some issues to deal with though.\r\n\r\n- When `runtimeExecutable` is specified, we will have to leave it up to the user. We can't always figure out its node version. It might be a script or something that isn't node. It might be electron, which ships a version of node 6.5 that doesn't include --inspect. We can probably figure out what this failure looks like, and give a helpful warning.\r\n- When attaching, we should be able to figure out which protocol it's using. One easy difference is that under the inspector protocol, we can make an http request to `http://localhost:port`.\r\n\r\nOther things to do:\r\n- Remove the 'experimental' tag on node2\r\n- Implement attaching to a running process using node2 - https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-node-debug2/issues/15\r\n- Localize node2 (strings already go through a dummy localize function, just need to actually hook it up to nls and get translations) - https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-node-debug2/issues/83\r\n\r\nFYI @weinand @joshgav","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19650/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19649","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19649/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19649/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19649/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19649","id":204452359,"number":19649,"title":"can't open new editor if current directory at startup was deleted","user":{"login":"skybrian","id":129084,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/129084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skybrian","html_url":"https://github.com/skybrian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skybrian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skybrian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skybrian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skybrian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skybrian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skybrian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skybrian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skybrian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skybrian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-31T23:14:00Z","updated_at":"2017-02-01T06:03:29Z","closed_at":"2017-02-01T06:03:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.8.1\r\n- OS Version: MacOS 10.12.2\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# shut down VS Code\r\nmkdir foo\r\ncd foo\r\ncode .\r\n# close editor window\r\ncd ..\r\nrmdir foo\r\ncode .\r\n# editor window is blank\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second time it starts, there is a blank (all black) window.

request:**\r\n\r\nWhen warned that  \"There is an active running task right now. Terminate it first before executing another task.\" when trying to start one task while another is running, selecting \"Terminate Running Task\" would terminate the running task and start the requested task.\r\n\r\n**What it does currently:** \r\nTerminates the task and then the user must redeclare which task they want to run, which (aside from the build task) means pulling up the task runner menu and selecting the task again.\r\n\r\n**Exceptions/Special Cases:**\r\nIf there exists a way to bring up this warning dialog besides attempting to start another task, the behavior should remain the same as it is now and not attempt to start any task as there is no task requested by the user.\r\n\r\n**Why we should add this:**\r\nThis will reduce effort required to terminate a running build task and move directly into another. This most often occurs when a programmer realizes they started a task with a bug and need to restart it or when terminating a watch task for some other task, which seems like it would be a pretty common use case.\r\n\r\nThis change will also, IMHO, fulfill the what the user would initially expect the \"Terminate Running Task\" button to do. This will reduce menu navigation and generally speed up development for anyone who would see this dialog.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19645","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19645/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19645/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19645/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/19645","id":204443296,"number":19645,"title":"Fix

VSCode Version: 1.8.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 7 Enterprise SP1\r\n\r\nPython 3.6 (64-bit) installed and in PATH.\r\n\r\nI wanted to try out VS Code, as I'd heard good things about it, but I had never used it or seen any tutorials on it. I installed it, and tried a few extensions that seemed like they would be useful to me (Python, Powershell, and Vim, although I then uninstalled the Vim extension until I had got some familiarity with the default behaviour). No more than half an hour's playing. I was interested in the \"integrated terminal\" and configured it to use Powershell, based on some comments on the web (why isn't Powershell the default if it's installed?).\r\n\r\nThen I wanted to see if I could get the Python REPL in the integrated terminal (without going via Powershell). So I tried Python: Start REPL from the command palette, but I got the error messages reported below.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what else to add, as I'm very new with VS code. Happy to do extra debugging if needed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. New install of VS Code.\r\n2. Install \"Python\" extension.\r\n3. Ctrl-Shift-P, select \"Python REPL\". Error command 'python.startREPL' not found.\r\n4. Open a .py file, and repeat. Different error: The terminal process command `python` failed to launch (exit code: 1)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19630","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19630/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19630/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19630/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19630","id":204319815,"number":19630,"title":"Nashorn debug plugin","user":{"login":"florentbernard","id":25362330,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25362330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/florentbernard","html_url":"https://github.com/florentbernard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florentbernard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florentbernard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florentbernard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florentbernard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florentbernard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florentbernard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florentbernard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florentbernard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florentbernard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-31T14:51:13Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T15:02:08Z","closed_at":"2017-01-31T15:02:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

syntax need to be extended with object rest/spread support.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSince [this fix that landed in version 1.8](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3804#issuecomment-265021769), Code is fine with using [Object rest spread](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-object-rest-spread/) in .js files.\r\n\r\nHowever, in JS-embedded-in-HTML (~~or in [`.vue` files](https://vuejs.org/) via all of the [extensions supporting it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=vue&target=VSCode&sortBy=Relevance) -- I tried `vue`, `Vue Components`, `Vetur` --~~ *EDIT Vetur seems to be fine, see below discussion*), a JS validation error `Property assignment expected` continues to be returned.\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version:\r\n    - Version 1.9.0-insider\r\n    - Commit
