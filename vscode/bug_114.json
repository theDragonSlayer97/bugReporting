Ideally I'd like to fall back to the `tab.inactiveForeground` colour (so that it has a reasonable default for any theme). However, I can't see a way to do this.\r\n\r\nIs there a nice way to handle this?

Version Information:\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.15.0\r\n- OS Version: Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601] (Windows 7)\r\n\r\n### Related to:\r\nThe issue is related to [31266](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31266), [30865](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30865).\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nNew API `vscode.debug.startDebugging` is supposed to replace `vscode.commands.executeCommand(\"vscode.startDebug\", launchConfiguration)` which does work correctly, but, with node.js \"inspector\" protocol, only with undocumented `type` `\"node2\"`, as explained in [31266](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31266), [30865](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30865). \r\n\r\nNot only `vscode.debug.startDebugging` does not reproduce correct functionality, but the symptoms look as if the `launchConfiguration` argument in `vscode.debug.startDebugging(launchConfiguration)` is ignored.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCode in extension:\r\n```\r\n        const launchConfiguration = {\r\n            type: \"node\",  \r\n            name: \"launch\",\r\n            request: \"launch\",\r\n            stopOnEntry: false,\r\n            protocol: \"auto\"\r\n        };\r\n        launchConfiguration.program = ... // assign appropriate program\r\n        vscode.debug.startDebugging(launchConfiguration);\r\n```\r\nThe result of the call depends on the presence of the workspace file \".vscode/launch.json\" of the target workspace using the extension. If the file is absent, the behavior is identical to the behavior when the user activates main menu item \"Debug\" => \"Start Debugging\" (F5): the user is requested for the choice and, if \"node.js\" is selected, the debugging starts with the currently opened JavaScript file (if any and if it is valid for the start of debugging).\r\n\r\n**Important**: this is not the file specified as `launchConfiguration.program`. Basically, the behavior suggests that the entire structure passed as `launchConfiguration` is ignored.\r\n\r\nIf the file \".vscode/launch.json\" is present, nothing happens, even if this file correctly prescribes debugging of the currently opened JavaScript file.\r\n\r\n### Reproduces without extensions:\r\nNo (the issue is itself related to extension development)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32382","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32382/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32382/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32382/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32382","id":249819131,"number":32382,"title":"code
