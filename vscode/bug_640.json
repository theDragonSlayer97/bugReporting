has recently gained advanced completion support which goes way beyond VS Code's internal PHP completion. It resolves types, looks at docblocks and suggests everything from classes, properties, methods etc. depending on context. Validation is also implemented.\r\n\r\nIt is currently blocked by https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node/issues/127, but after that I plan to release it. The problem though is that there is no way to disable the built-in completion and snippets for PHP, so you will get a lot of duplicated results (because the built-in completion is not context-aware).\r\n\r\nSince PHP is the only language that has bundled completion and validation, I would propose to just remove it from core (only keep syntax highlighting).\r\n\r\n@mousetraps
