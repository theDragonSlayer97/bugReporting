TS extract method code action results in the quick fix light bulb being shown on almost every expression. This can be annyoing and also reveals that TS currently shows extract method in far more places than it probably should\r\n\r\nI believe that VS does not automatically show the lightbulb for refactorings, only for quick fixes. With the current VS Code API,  there is now way for a `CodeActionProvider` to say if the lightbulb should be shown or not\r\n\r\n**Fix**\r\nThis change adds a new `CodeAction` type with an additional `dontTriggerLightBulb` property. When a code action sets this property, the light bulb will not be automatically shown.\r\n\r\n**Other possible API designs**\r\nAnother possible design would be to allow different `CodeActionProvider` to be provided for 'automatic' triggering (the current behavior), vs manually triggering (when the user presses ctrl+.). Such an API has the advantage of never computing manual code actions until they are actually needed. The downside is that `CodeActionProviders` would have to be polled during a UI operation in the manual case.\r\n\r\nFixes

Create a folder `Root`\r\n2. Create a css file `Root\\style.cs` with the following content\r\n```css\r\nh3 {\r\n    color: red;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Create a md file `Root\\index.md`\r\n```markdown\r\n###index\r\n```\r\n4. Copy the file into `Root\\subfolder\\index.md`\r\n```markdown\r\n###index\r\n```\r\n5.

Close all the editor tabs (including the markdown preview)\r\n11. Open the `Root\\subfolder\\index.md` in the editor\r\n12. Open the markdown preview tab\r\n13.

consider automatic function folding, based on the current cursor location.\r\n\r\nI think it can be a great way to help developers maintain a high level mental map of source files and ease navigation between functions/methods. While it builds on existing building blocks already present in many code editors (block folding, tracking language specific scopes, ...) it may also be a novel approach (I'm not aware of any existing implementation)\r\n\r\nThe core idea is to edit source code with all functions folded by default, and expand the \"current\" function when the cursor enters it, then fold it back when the cursor leaves the function region. Explicit pins can allow developers to keep key functions expanded.\r\n\r\n[Full description of the proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13L_xmx64E-2Y8lHRX7wzJOXVteVMTApeUhcF4RSKU-w/edit?usp=sharing)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33449/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33448","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33448/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33448/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33448/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33448","id":253784300,"number":33448,"title":"Select all (cmd-a) shortcut doesn't work on Save As dialog (the file name field)","user":{"login":"Bathlamos","id":4612142,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4612142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bathlamos","html_url":"https://github.com/Bathlamos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bathlamos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bathlamos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bathlamos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bathlamos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bathlamos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bathlamos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bathlamos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bathlamos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bathlamos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-29T19:56:19Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T06:56:47Z","closed_at":"2017-08-30T06:56:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
