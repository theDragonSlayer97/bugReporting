With this release we are starting to support the \"server mode\" as an official run mode for debug adapters.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this feature did not involve any code changes. We just tried to find a way to use the server mode for production by only using existing functionality.\r\n\r\nHere is how the feature is used:\r\n\r\nIn your extension you can register a hook for the 'startSession' event, which is triggered when a new debug session is launched. In this hook you determine the port on which the debug adapter listens (or you can even start the debug adapter there). Then you assign the port number to the `debugServer` attribute (if this is still undefined).\r\n\r\nHere is the complete 'xxx'-extension code that goes into the `activate` hook:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncontext.subscriptions.push(vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.xxx.startSession', config => {\r\n\tif (!config.debugServer) {\r\n\t\tconfig.debugServer = 12345;\t// determine debug port \r\n\t}\r\n\tvscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.startDebug', config);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the package.json you need these contributions:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\"activationEvents\": [\r\n\t// ...\r\n\t\"onCommand:extension.xxx.startSession\"\r\n\t// ...\r\n],\r\n\"contributes\": {\r\n\t\"debuggers\": [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"xxx\",\r\n\t\t\t// ...\r\n\t\t\t\"startSessionCommand\": \"extension.xxx.startSession\"\r\n\t\t\t// ...\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nVerify that...\r\n- a debug adapter (e.g. node-debug) works correct in server mode\r\n- focus on testing the life-cycle functionality of the debug adapter, e.g. 'restart' \r\n- there is no end user observable difference when running a debug adapter in server mode","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23290","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23290/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23290/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23290/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23290","id":217270704,"number":23290,"title":"Test fuzzy intellisense matching","user":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/37","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/37","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/37/labels","id":2317844,"number":37,"title":"March 2017","description":"","creator":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":663,"state":"closed","created_at":"2017-02-13T07:33:31Z","updated_at":"2017-06-25T20:58:50Z","due_on":"2017-03-31T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-04-06T09:12:10Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-03-27T14:47:41Z","updated_at":"2017-03-28T21:42:20Z","closed_at":"2017-03-28T21:42:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Test for: #22153\r\nComplexity: 2\r\n\r\n- [x] Any OS - @joaomoreno \r\n- [x] Any OS - @roblourens \r\n\r\nWe have different scoring and filtering for suggestions in place.

This is useful if you need to set a breakpoint in a script that is not part of your workspace and therefore cannot be easily located and opened by normal VS Code file browsing means.\r\nA typical scenario for this is a remote debugging session: you attach to a remote node program and have no code available locally.\r\n\r\nThe **Debug: Open Loaded Script** action gives you access to loaded scripts while a debug session is active. In the QuickPick you can filter and select the script to open. The script is then loaded into a read-only editor where you can set breakpoints.\r\n\r\nVerify for both 'legacy' and 'inspector' that...\r\n- you can set and hit breakpoints,\r\n- script breakpoints have a path beginning with '<node_internals>' in the breakpoints view,\r\n- script breakpoints are remembered across debug sessions,\r\n- a script that opens in the editor when a breakpoint is hit is the same as when loading it via the \"Debug: Open Loaded Script\" action. Verify this by watching carefully that the script loaded in the editor via selecting a stackframe is not replaced with another script when using the \"Debug: Open Loaded Script\" action. The result of both actions should refer to the same file. In addition the breakpoints shown in the gutter and the scrolling position of the script should be identical.\r\n- try to break the

Create a simple project using launch.json and an electron entry file.\r\n2. try to debug main process. \r\n\r\n### What happens?\r\nVSCode resolves the path of the `runtimeExecutable` wrong. Instead of `D:\\Data\\Desktop\\theclassic-desktop/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd` VSCode creates the path `d:\\Data\\Desktop\\theclassic-desktop/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd`, which does not exist on the device. Therefore the launch failes with no errors thrown (except an entry within the `CALL STACK` pane under the debug view. It says `No call stack available (vscode_backtrace: Internal Error: undefined is not a function)`. \r\n\r\nMy `launch.json` looks like this:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n  \"configurations\": [{\r\n    \"name\": \"Debug Main Process\",\r\n    \"type\": \"node\",\r\n    \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n    \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\r\n    \"runtimeExecutable\": \"${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron\",\r\n    \"windows\": {\r\n      \"runtimeExecutable\": \"${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/src/main-process/main.js\"\r\n  }],\r\n  \"compounds\": []\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks like `${workspaceRoot}` lowers the first letter for some reason.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23281","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23281/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23281/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23281/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/23281","id":217252882,"number":23281,"title":"Added

There are definitely files in the folder, and they are not hidden. The files inside are sometimes open in editors.\r\n4. Refresh causes the folder to unfold momentarily, and then disappear.\r\n5. The triangular indicator suggests the folder is unfolded.\r\n6. There are no messages in the Chrome console when I refresh or when I try to fold/unfold the folder.\r\n7.

The task running framework stops parsing the output when the exit event is fired hence `HelloWorld.ts(3,17): error TS2339: Property 'loog' does not exist on type 'Console'.` is not recognized as being a valid output of the task anymore.\r\n\r\nIMO the terminal should fire 'exit' or some other event when all output from the process is processed.
