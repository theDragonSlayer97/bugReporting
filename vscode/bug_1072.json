using **VS Code 0.10.9** on **OS X 10.11.3** with [Code-D](https://github.com/Pure-D/code-d) for writing code in **D**. \n\nI have all the dependencies that **Code-D** requests, and I can see that the plugin is properly initiated, but I can't get the **autocompletion** (intellisense) box to show. I have a .gif to describe  the problem:\n\n![vscode](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5645089/13436536/04f77988-dfe0-11e5-932b-7b131df71753.gif)\n\nWhen I open Developer's Tools, I can see that the symbols are resolved properly, there is a list of objects I should be able to see in the autocompletion box, but it just hangs with \"Loading...\" message. Sometimes it hangs indefinitely, sometimes I get it to show literally after 1 minute. I also have to press _CTRL+Space_ after **\".\"**, it's not triggered automatically.\n\nI have to pinpoint that this issue is known for this plugin, but only on OSX. Couple of people reported it, but there's nothing obvious wrong with the plugin. Just asking for clues if this is indeed a plugin problem, or somewhere below in VS Code and OSX.\n\nAny help appreciated.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3600","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3600/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3600/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3600/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3600","id":137645325,"number":3600,"title":"Vim Style Key binding","user":{"login":"waderyan","id":2449568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2449568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan","html_url":"https://github.com/waderyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waderyan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":295276395,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/VIM","name":"VIM","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"kieferrm","id":4674940,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4674940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm","html_url":"https://github.com/kieferrm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kieferrm","id":4674940,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4674940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm","html_url":"https://github.com/kieferrm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":108,"created_at":"2016-03-01T18:04:01Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T21:07:00Z","closed_at":"2017-04-21T21:07:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There are a few extensions in the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=vim&target=VSCode&sortBy=Relevance) for Vim, however Vim key bindings is still such a hot request in [User Voice](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/293070-visual-studio-code/suggestions/7752447-vim-style-keybindings).
