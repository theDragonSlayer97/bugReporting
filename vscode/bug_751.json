ran into an usability problem with a specific keyboard layout (bépo, a French dvorak variant) and VSCode. The shift+space combination produces non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), and it is very easy to hit involuntarily when typing a space before or after a capital letter. This is not a problem itself, but it becomes one when a codebase is littered with invisible non-ASCII characters.\n\nA simple fix in my case would be to show non-breaking spaces in an obvious way when editor.renderWhitespace is turned on. In 1.5.3 non-breaking space seems to be treated like a word character by renderWhitespace.\n\nEmacs displays it even out of whitespace-mode with a bold colored underscore, and that can be done in Vim with listchars. As this does not look like a very complicated problem, I could submit it as a first PR to the project.\n\nI checked, but if this has already been fixed or the discussion has already taken place, please feel free to close the issue.\n\nP.S. : VSCode is an awesome piece of software and a pleasure to use, please keep up with the great work!\n- VSCode Version: 1.5.3\n- OS Version: Linux 4.7.6-1-ARCH  x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Turn on renderWhitespace\n2. Insert a non-breaking space (U+00A0) in the middle of an indentation\n3. The non-breaking space character is invisible, and the indentation following it becomes invisible\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13239/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13238","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13238/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13238/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13238/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/13238","id":181100228,"number":13238,"title":"Headings outline for markdown","user":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"kieferrm","id":4674940,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4674940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm","html_url":"https://github.com/kieferrm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kieferrm","id":4674940,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4674940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm","html_url":"https://github.com/kieferrm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieferrm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-10-05T09:05:47Z","updated_at":"2016-11-01T20:35:43Z","closed_at":"2016-10-31T09:22:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/pulls/13238","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/13238","diff_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/13238.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/13238.patch"},"body":"Adds a DocumentSymbolProvider for markdown that lists headings.
