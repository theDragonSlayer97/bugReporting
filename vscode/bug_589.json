If you were pinged to this thread, it's because **VS Code needs your help**!\r\n\r\nUsers behind proxies have had a tough time lately, and we want to make sure we fix this. We've created a [small app](https://github.com/joaomoreno/proxy-tests) which will test your machine, network and environment to figure out which network stack works best for you.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>App Screenshot</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22350/21641156/58b06908-d27a-11e6-981a-2f4555a3c680.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## How can I help?\r\n\r\nWe ask you to:\r\n\r\n1. [Download](https://github.com/joaomoreno/proxy-tests/releases) and extract the appropriate ZIP for your platform\r\n2. Run it\r\n3. Type your proxy URL in the input box\r\n4. Click `Run Tests`\r\n5. Be patient, it should eventually be done\r\n6. Copy the test results to your clipboard\r\n7. Finally, reply to this thread with:\r\n  - Details about your machine (platform, OS)\r\n  - Details about your network (proxy type, is it a corporate environment)\r\n  - A list of the network-related features that don't work for you in VSCode\r\n  - The results of the test\r\n\r\nExample reply:\r\n\r\n> I'm running Windows 10, I am in a corporate environment and I know my proxy address. I can browse VS Code extensions but I can't install them.\r\n> \r\n> [PASTE TABLE]\r\n\r\nWe thank you in advance!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@liaoya, @dfroze, @akcorp2003, @ruslanch, @bruceauyeung, @raphabi,

and improve key bindings customisations experience. \r\n\r\nFollowing are the proposals, use cases, challenges in this area\r\n\r\n### Keybindings view\r\nA table based view, each row for each key binding\r\n\r\nKey | Command | When | Action\r\n------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------\r\nalt+cmd+[ | editor.fold | editorTextFocus | Unbind\r\nalt+cmd+] | editor.unfoldRecursively | editorTextFocus | Unbind\r\nBind | workbench.action.reloadWindow |  | Bind\r\n\r\n#### Show the correct Keybindings based on the keyboard layout (both defaults and user)\r\n\r\nCurrently, keybindings show the keys those were shown in the US Keyboard. Since the keys location changes with Keyboard layout, some of the Keybindings shown as is in the file do not work. For eg: \r\n<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd> does not work on German layout key board. Instead the associated Keybinding for this is <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd><</kbd>\r\n\r\n#### Show the invalid Keybindings\r\nSome key bindings might not makes sense in some keyboard layouts since . Show such keybindings as unbound entries, probably with message?\r\n\r\n#### Grouping\r\n\r\nGroup key bindings by VS code core and each extension key bindings\r\n\r\n#### Command id vs title\r\n\r\nShow just title or just id or both for the command column? Not all commands have labels and not all command ids are straight to interpret what action they perform. Not all command ids maps well with labels.\r\n\r\n#### When context\r\n\r\n`when`  is a combination of the location in VS Code where key binding is applied to and the pre-condition to be met to trigger the action. Not all commands have proper separation of location and precondition. Also some commands have multiple locations. How to render this when clause? How to let user edit this?\r\n\r\n#### Command args\r\n\r\n`args` How to display args\r\n\r\n#### Bound and unbound commands \r\n\r\nDisplay bound and unbound commands as two different groups\r\n\r\n### As a user, I would like to associate a Keybinding to a command/action\r\n\r\nUser should be able to find an action say in `Keybindings editor` or `Command Pallette` and associate a key binding to it. Use the widget `Define Keybinding` to record the Key bindings instead of writing it by hand. \r\n\r\nAn action next to command pallette list entry to bind/unbind the key binding?\r\n\r\n### As a user, I would like to find the command/action for a Keybinding.\r\n\r\nUser should be able to find the Keybinding in `Keybindings editor` and see the associated commands/actions to it. \r\n\r\n### As a sophisticated user, I would like to switch to native old keybindings json from the new editor\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18095/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4773","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"838A:3670:A82370:1B1D583:59D93DCF","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=590>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=588>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d64ca9f27b20be7ece253e1d67f43f98\"","status":"200 OK"}}
