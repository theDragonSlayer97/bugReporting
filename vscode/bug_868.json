tried a whole day to get remote debugging with break points on my VM, but I didn't succeed. I have read all old issues, blog posts and SO. But I still cannot figure out what I've done wrong?\n\nI have a VM running locally on my Mac at host `app.local`. Inside the VM I have a folder `/home/myusername/app`, I have a TS project. Here is my configurations :\n\n``` json\n    {\n        \"compilerOptions\": {\n            \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n            \"target\": \"es5\",\n            \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n            \"outDir\": \"Build\",\n            \"rootDir\": \".\",\n            \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n            \"jsx\": \"react\",\n            \"reactNamespace\": \"Element\",\n            \"removeComments\": true,\n            \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n            \"strictNullChecks\": true,\n            \"noEmitOnError\": true,\n            \"noImplicitThis\": true,\n            \"inlineSourceMap\": true,\n            \"inlineSources\": true\n        },\n        \"exclude\": [\n            \"node_modules\",\n            \"vendor\"\n        ]\n    }\n```\n\nAnd here is my `launch.json`:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Attach\",\n            \"type\": \"node\",\n            \"request\": \"attach\",\n            \"address\": \"app.local\",\n            \"port\": 5858,\n            \"sourceMaps\": true,\n            \"localRoot\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\n            \"remoteRoot\": \"/home/myusername/app\",\n            \"restart\": true\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n```\n\nI can see the generated files have inlined source map and inlined sources(I have also tried with non-inlined mapping as well). I start the server `node-dev --debug Build/Start.js`. After that I attach to the process and succeeds. But the problem comes when I try to set a break point — it fails?\n\nI have also tried many `remoteRoot` paths to hopefully get the breakpoints working, though failed? I don't think I have a remote idea what I've done wrong at this

I don't want to corrupt another file or make my laptop hard shut off.  \n\nHere's what I know:\n\nI am not going to say that the laptop shutting off is VSCode's fault -- it may have just been coincidence that I was typing in it at the same time.  The laptop is fully charged on batteries and was plugged in as well.\n\nThe file I was working on was a .js file with es6 syntax.  I was using the multi-line edit functionality at the time and had 4 slices of text in my clipboard.\n\nWhen I turned the machine back on, windows came up no problems.  I signed in and all my applications were closed, so I know it completely shut off -- not just randomly sleep.\n\nWhen I re-opened VSCode it looks like the rest of my files are there.  The corrupted file looks like it was completely wiped and 0-written (or something).\n\nPossibly a bug with the auto-save?  Concurrent access?  I was typing when this happened.\n\nSorry I don't think I can provide a lot more, but this was BAD BAD BAD.\n\nCorrupted file contents as opened in Sublime:\n\n```\n0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
