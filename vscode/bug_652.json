there!\r\n\r\nI've been experiencing a problem when highlighting errors on VSCode. Whenever you have big issues you can spot them on the fly when opening the document. But if your issues are small, you need more time to spot those errors.\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the image below, these 2 lines have 2 errors and both of them have the problem of not having a semicolon at the end of the line:\r\n![screen shot 2016-11-29 at 15 45 30](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8843202/20714411/41aa18f2-b64c-11e6-8189-33bf5d188231.png)\r\n\r\nThe first one is easier to spot than the second (at the end of the parenthesis). The simpler solution for this would be to highlight the entire line in some way (so double highlight) just to spot easily the lines that have errors.\r\n\r\nAtom does this the following way:\r\n![screen shot 2016-11-29 at 15 48 21](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8843202/20714571/afd983e4-b64c-11e6-931c-66c0ae556576.png)\r\n\r\nThanks and keep up the good work!\r\n\r\n-

might be causing this.

support a feature similar to Visual Studio's \"Just my Code\" feature. With this you can easily skip over \"uninteresting\" code when debugging.\r\nThe feature is enabled by specifying the skipped code through a set of glob patterns for a `skipFiles` attribute. Positive patterns (e.g. `foo/**/*.js`) add to the set of skipped files, while negative patterns (e.g. `!foo/**/bar.js`) subtract from that set. In the following \"skipped code\" means code that is covered by the `skipFiles` glob patterns.\r\n\r\nIf skipped code is enabled, debugging is affected in the following way:\r\n- if you step into skipped code, VS Code will continue to 'step in' until it reaches code that is not skipped.\r\n- If you have a breakpoint in skipped code, the debugger will still break at that breakpoint and you can step manually inside the skipped code until you 'continue' or step out of it.\r\n- You won't break on caught exceptions thrown in skipped code.\r\n\r\nVerify that:\r\n- the feature works as described both for debug type `node`and
