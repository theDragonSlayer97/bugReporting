Run \"dotnet + chrome\"\r\n3. You will see VSCodes info bar that I should set up the launch configuration\r\n\r\nPS: It doesn't happen all the time. Sometimes it starts also the chrome configuration. But most of the time it shows the info.\r\n\r\n![multiple target

When you configure to debug a **coreclr web** application and you want to debug also the javascript via **Debugger for chrome**, the **chrome** configuration should be started after the **coreclr** has started. Because otherwise the browser starts although there is no running web server.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Setup a core and chrome launch configuration similar to this\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n\t\"configurations\": [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"Launch Core\",\r\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"coreclr\",\r\n\t\t\t\"request\": \"launch\",\r\n\t\t\t\"preLaunchTask\": \"build\",\r\n\t\t\t\"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}\\\\bin\\\\Debug\\\\netcoreapp1.0\\\\MyWebApp.dll\",\r\n\t\t\t\"args\": [],\r\n\t\t\t\"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\r\n\t\t\t\"stopAtEntry\": false,\r\n\t\t\t\"internalConsoleOptions\": \"openOnSessionStart\",\r\n\t\t\t\"env\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Development\"\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"Launch Chrome\",\r\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"chrome\",\r\n\t\t\t\"request\": \"launch\",\r\n\t\t\t\"url\": \"http://localhost:5000\",\r\n\t\t\t\"sourceMaps\": true,\r\n\t\t\t\"webRoot\": \"${workspaceRoot}/wwwroot\"\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"dotnet + chrome\",\r\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"composite\",\r\n\t\t\t\"request\": \"launch\",\r\n\t\t\t\"configurationNames\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t\"Launch Core\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"Launch Chrome\"\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Run \"dotnet + chrome\"\r\n3. You will see that that browser starts although the core application is still compiling or starting\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nThe chrome configuration should start after the dotnet app has compiled and started.\r\n\r\nPS: Most of the times the browser doesn't even start. Then I get the message, that I should configure my launch.json see Bug
