@JanKok on March 8, 2016 8:36_\n\nI'm trying to do C code development using gcc and make and using WebFreak001's gdb debugger extension. I added `\"preLaunchTask\": \"make\"` to launch.json and\n\n```\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"command\": \"make\",\n    \"isShellCommand\": false,\n    // Show the output window only if unrecognized errors occur.\n    \"showOutput\": \"always\", //\"silent\",\n\n    // use the standard tsc problem matcher to find compile problems\n    // in the output.\n    \"problemMatcher\": \"$tsc\"\n}\n```\n\nin tasks.json and now make runs each time I click start, which is pretty good. But,\n1. If there are compile errors (resulting in make returning an error value), Code doesn't stop. It tries to run the program anyway.\n2. The make output window appears momentarily but is replaced with the debug console (which BTW displays the cryptic message `undefined=thread-group-added,id=\"i1\"`). I'd like the output window to remain visible if there are make errors.\n3. F8, Ctrl-Shift-M etc., don't work to let me visit the errors in my source code.

I just thought I'd mention it in case is a general assumption rather than just for ESLint plugin\n\nIn a coupe of places the release notes for Eslint make the assumption that it will be globally installed. I have found global installation to be an anti-pattern and now install all dev deps locally for each project. The reason is version clashes. It is possible to be working on a project that requires specific version of such tools. This is likely of you switch often. Also I use nvm-winodws for different version of node which doesn't share global installations. Also local installation means package.json much better describes the dependencies.\n\nIt's easy to run any local tool by prefixing it with ./node_modules./bin/ or better, add a npm script which add that to the path when run.\n\nIn general code and plugins should support everything installed locally.\n\nI've not yet hopped on my dev pc to see if the new release works with my local ESLint installation and config.\n\nthanks for listening\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3822","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3822/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3822/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3822/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3822","id":139224918,"number":3822,"title":"File explorer in sidebar stays grey after renaming a file","user":{"login":"4kochi","id":1742426,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1742426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/4kochi","html_url":"https://github.com/4kochi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4kochi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4kochi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4kochi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4kochi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4kochi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4kochi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4kochi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4kochi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4kochi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-03-08T09:31:23Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T08:30:32Z","closed_at":"2016-03-08T10:17:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When renaming a file the file explorer becomes grey.

guys!\n\nSome days ago I was trying to debug a Node.js application written in TypeScript from Visual Studio Code and I had some troubles; then I asked on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35606423/visual-studio-code-debug-node-js-through-typescript) and shared my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/7brutus7/stackoverflow).\nThis is the latest working version, you can download it and **debug** correctly on Visual Studio Code (by \"debug correctly\" I mean that you can add a breakpoint on a .ts file and then see the debugger stopping on it) but if you then rename the **root folder** by adding some **spaces in the path** (for example changing from \"stackoverflow\" to \"stack overflow\") the debugger stops working and when launching it I get the following **error**:\n\n`Cannot launch program 'c:\\Users\\brutus\\Desktop\\stack overflow\\src\\app.ts'; setting the 'outDir' attribute might help.`\n\nI think it's a **bug** but I'm not completely sure, can you confirm please?\n\nThank you very much, hope this helps! :smile:
