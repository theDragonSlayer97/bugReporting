state\"` you will notice that ~10ms are spend in the history service comparing the current input with old input. The time is spend in `handleEditorEventInHistory` which is busy retrieving data from storage, building URIs and comparing them against other URIs. The code uses `URI.parse` and `URI.toString` which have many safe guards and checks and are consequently not super-fast. However, when you can trust URI, like in this case as they are generated/stored/retrieved from use you should use `URI.toJSON` and `URI.revive` or better and easier [`marshalling#stringify/parse`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/base/common/marshalling.ts#L9) which are drop in replacements (and used by workers/ext-host communication)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4777","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"82C0:366F:C8E339:18825FB:59D93DBE","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=586>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=584>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"58e6204b7f8e5bd0f6d24f0692011387\"","status":"200 OK"}}
