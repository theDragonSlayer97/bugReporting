find it very confusing that we have \"Start\" and \"Run\" commands in the palette and only one command exposed in the debug viewlet. For a user it is not clear at all which one connects the debugger and which one does not. \n\nI don't have good ideas how to solve this but some thoughts:\n- expose both run and start in the viewlet (let the green arrow be a dropdown?)\n- make it very clear (in the label?) that one connects the debugger and one does not\n- use a different color in the status bar (not the orange)\n\n@isidorn @weinand @stevencl @bgashler1 fyi\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5322","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5322/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5322/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5322/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5322","id":148616983,"number":5322,"title":"[Extension] Support custom context menu","user":{"login":"f111fei","id":7069719,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7069719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f111fei","html_url":"https://github.com/f111fei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f111fei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f111fei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f111fei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f111fei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f111fei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f111fei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f111fei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f111fei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f111fei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-15T10:00:19Z","updated_at":"2016-04-15T10:51:27Z","closed_at":"2016-04-15T10:51:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is there a plan to support custom context menu? like:\nhttps://atom.io/docs/api/v1.7.1/ContextMenuManager\nor\nhttp://wiki.eclipse.org/Menu_Contributions#menu\n\nThanks.
