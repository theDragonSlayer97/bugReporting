Click on one of the editors in the centre group\n   Expected: the editor to be selected and the list to remain static\n   Actual: the editor is selected but the list moves so that the selected item is no longer under the mouse\n\nI found this quite hard to repro. I noticed it happen occasionally but each time it happened I couldn't easily make it happen again. The above steps are the best repro steps I could find. \n\nIf you have to scroll the list of open editors so that the centre group becomes visible, it doesn't repro so easily.\n\nThis was found while
