VSCode Version: 1.12.1 (all extensions disabled)\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nThe ability of JSX tag expansion (Emmet) to function in js/jsx files is dependent on the type of the file first viewed when the VS Code is opened.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create/open a project with a blank `.js` and a blank `.jsx` file.\r\n2. Open both files.\r\n3. Set the current editor tab to the `.jsx` file.\r\n4. Use the \"Reload window\" command (or just close and reopen VS Code).\r\n5. Typing something like `div.myclass` and pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> will expand it into a JSX tag, in both the jsx file and the js file.\r\n6. Set the current editor tab to the `.js` file.\r\n7. Repeat step 4.\r\n8. Typing something like `div.myclass` and pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> will not work, in either the js file or the jsx file.\r\n\r\nThis also applies when you close all the editor tabs before reloading, the first file type opened will determine how it behaves.\r\n\r\nNote that in both cases, tag expansion *will* work as long as the cursor is placed within a pair of enclosing JSX/HTML tags (I assume because this switches the language scope to `jsx-tags` or whatever).

observed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26630","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26630/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26630/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26630/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26630","id":228588058,"number":26630,"title":"[Feature

to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open .cs file containing a C# class\r\n2. Notice other features of the extension are functioning: Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Find All References, .NET Core Attach debugging, etc.\r\n3. The extension is installed (see list above) in ~/.vscode/extensions/ms-vscode.csharp-1.9.0/\r\n4. The snippets file exists in the snippets sub-dir as csharp.json\r\n5. Common snippets like \"prop\", \"namespace\", etc. simply do not appear.\r\n6. Note the \"class\" snippet does show up in the intellisense list but produces bad output:\r\n```\r\n    class Name\r\n    {\r\n    \r\n    ,\r\n    }|<== the cursor is left here after specifying the class name and hitting return\r\n```\r\n7. \"foreach\" snippet does the same thing:\r\n```\r\n            foreach (var item in collection)\r\n            {\r\n            \r\n            ,\r\n            }|<== the cursor is left here after specifying var, item and collection and hitting return\r\n```\r\n8. Command-Shift-p and \"Insert Snippet\" shows the snippets that will show up in context; all of the ones I tried from the list had the same formatting issues.\r\n9. Here is what I see from csharp.json for the \"class\" snippet.\r\n```\r\n        \"Class\": {\r\n\r\n                \"prefix\": \"class\",\r\n                \"body\": [\r\n                        \"class ${Name}\",\r\n                        \"{\",\r\n                        \"       $0\",\r\n                        \"}\"\r\n                ],\r\n                \"description\": \"Class\"\r\n        },\r\n```\r\nGiven this I suspect there are some syntax errors in this file. But see below - it appears that is not the whole story.\r\n\r\n_Note I did try to re-compile the extension in hopes that the json file would be regenerated somehow. But after npm i and doing npm run compile I got an error about missing tsconfig.json file and then also noticed there was no source delivered with the extension. So I stopped there._\r\n\r\nNote the csharp.json file had not changed since Oct 2016 - there were 2 commits recently:\r\n[csharp.json commmits](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/commits/master/snippets/csharp.json)\r\n\r\nThere are several issues opened in the OmniSharp repo - [#1459](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1459) is just one. So treat this as an FYI.\r\n\r\nHowever they do reference [MS VSCode #26101](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26101) as part of the problem.\r\n\r\nThe [OmniSharp VSCode #1464](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/1464) issue was closed on May 8 by Dustin Campbell with a reference to MS #26101.\r\n\r\nI am hoping you and the OmniSharp folks can fix this soon. It is impactful to snippets across all extensions.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26622","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26622/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26622/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26622/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26622","id":228554994,"number":26622,"title":"CompletionItemProvider#resolve not always called","user":{"login":"kdvolder","id":1002156,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1002156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdvolder","html_url":"https://github.com/kdvolder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdvolder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdvolder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdvolder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdvolder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdvolder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdvolder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdvolder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdvolder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdvolder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":421907356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/suggest","name":"suggest","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":578047123,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/under-discussion","name":"under-discussion","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-05-14T17:13:36Z","updated_at":"2017-07-24T15:06:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:\r\n```\r\n$ code --version\r\n1.12.1\r\nf6868fce3eeb16663840eb82123369dec6077a9b\r\n```\r\n\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install the extension from this vsix file:  https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3-test.spring.io/sts4/vscode-extensions/snapshots/vscode-concourse-0.0.6-RC.1.vsix \r\n2. Create a file called 'pipeline.yml' and put this text in it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresources:\r\n- name: demo-repo\r\n  type: git\r\n  source:\r\n    uri: git@github.com/kdvolder/demo-repo\r\n    <*>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. The `<*>` marks the cursor/caret position. So delete it and place cursor there.\r\n\r\n4. Press CTRL-SPACE to invoke content assist.\r\n\r\nNow, in order to see the problem. Only use the mouse to invoke the last proposal in the list. I.e **Do not** use the cursor keys, also *Do no* type to narrow the proposals. Instead, scroll-down (using mouse or scrollwheel) to the last proposal its text is `← ← - name`. Then **click** the proposal with the mouse to invoke it.\r\n\r\n=> Observe: The completion simply inserts the label text. So the editor contents becomes this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresources:\r\n- name: demo-repo\r\n  type: git\r\n  source:\r\n    uri: git@github.com/kdvolder/demo-repo\r\n    ← ← - name\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is wrong. Compare this to the intended/correct behaviour which you can get by using cursor keys (instead of mouse) to move down and select the proposal, then press `ENTER` to invoke it. In this case the editor contents becomes this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresources:\r\n- name: demo-repo\r\n  type: git\r\n  source:\r\n    uri: git@github.com/kdvolder/demo-repo\r\n- name: \r\n```\r\n\r\nI speculate that the reason for the discrepancy is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. our completions must be resolved to get the doc-string as well as fill in the edit. \r\n2. When we use cursor navigation the doc-strings are revealed in the UI, and this forces the details, including the edits to be filled in.\r\n3. When we directly click on a completion, then its doc string is never revealed and the item is therefore not being resolved.

The problem is using the newest (1.12.1) VSCode, I find the IntelliSense is missing in Typescript. When I reopen the project, the IntelliSense appears but disappears some time later (several minutes).  The bug is strange, because it only appears in some of my projects. I do not know why. Now, I rollback to 1.11.2, the problem is missing. Is there anyone who could help me resolve this issue? Thanks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIt is hard to reproduce the problem.
