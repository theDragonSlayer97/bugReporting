It appears that the tslint-server is started with each VSCode window, even before I've even opened a TypeScript file, even when the project does not even include any TypeScript files.\n\nBecause the tslint-server is always started, I get the toast / snackbar error \"Failed to load tslint library\" even in projects where it would never make sense for me to have the tslint NPM package installed. Note that I very much appreciate this message for TypeScript projects, it's very helpful in that case.\n\nThe majority of my projects use plain JavaScript, although I do hop through several TypeScript projects, too.\n\nI'm not sure whether this is an extension-specific issue, or whether VSCode itself could be using documentSelector information from an extension to delay loading it until the first time a matching document type is encountered. /shrug\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9247","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9247/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9247/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9247/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9247","id":165462133,"number":9247,"title":"ContextMenu in Editor/Title only available with Tabs active","user":{"login":"alefragnani","id":3781424,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3781424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani","html_url":"https://github.com/alefragnani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alefragnani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-07-14T02:23:18Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T11:20:52Z","closed_at":"2016-07-14T08:31:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:1.3.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nUsing the [newly available API](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates#_extension-authoring)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
