It is quite handy and other IDEs offer this feature, too.\nSo if you focus the folder \"foo\" in tree of the \"Explorer\" view and you press ⌘⇧F, than \"files to include\" should be filled with \"foo\", so the user can search directly in \"foo\".\n\nThe search value is automatically filled, too, if you have text selected in the editor. This happens in `getSelectionFromEditor` and is possible because the \"Search\" view has access to the editor (`this.editorService.getActiveEditor().getControl()`).\n\nI tried to find a way to get the focused element in the tree \"Explorer\" view. \n\nThis is possible in `OpenSearchViewletAction`:\n\n```\nclass OpenSearchViewletAction extends ToggleViewletAction {\n    public static ID = VIEWLET_ID;\n    public static LABEL = nls.localize('showSearchViewlet', \"Show Search\");\n\n    constructor(id: string, label: string, @IViewletService viewletService: IViewletService, @IWorkbenchEditorService editorService: IWorkbenchEditorService) {\n        if (viewletService.getActiveViewlet() instanceof ExplorerViewlet) {\n            const viewer = (<ExplorerViewlet>viewletService.getActiveViewlet()).getExplorerView().getViewer();\n            console.log(viewer.getFocus());\n        }\n        super(id, label, VIEWLET_ID, viewletService, editorService);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will call `this.viewletService.openViewlet(this.viewletId, true);` (in `ToggleViewletAction#run`) later, so we switch to the \"Search\" view. It seems there is no way to pass the focused element from the tree \"Explorer\" view to the \"Search\" view here, so I can fill \"files to include\".\n\nAny hint how I can do that...?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5047","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5047/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5047/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5047/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5047","id":146397809,"number":5047,"title":"Support
