VS Code crashes after latest upgrade. It has crashed 2 times in 10 minutes. I'm working on a angularJs project. The workflow is as follow\r\n - in first terminal (powershell) start TS with watch : >>tsc -w\r\n - in second terminal (powershell) start live server: >>live-server\r\n\r\nAfter a little while VS Code will crash.\r\n**Work around**:  Launch external shells and run the commands there. After doing this I have not seen any crash.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Have not tried.\r\n\r\nEdit: add versions\r\n\r\n- node v6.11.1\r\n- tsc v2.4.2\r\n- live-server v1.2.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34304","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34304/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34304/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34304/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34304","id":257423823,"number":34304,"title":"vscode should NOT use currently opened files as \"the project\"","user":{"login":"srcspider","id":338910,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/338910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srcspider","html_url":"https://github.com/srcspider","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srcspider/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srcspider/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srcspider/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srcspider/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srcspider/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srcspider/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srcspider/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srcspider/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srcspider/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":421131022,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/as-designed","name":"as-designed","color":"E2A1C2","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-09-13T15:27:25Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T22:12:47Z","closed_at":"2017-09-25T22:12:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.16.0 (787b31c0474e6165390b5a5989c9619e3e16f953, 2017-09-06T16:19:37.192Z)\r\n- OS Version: Linux x64 4.10.0-33-generic\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\nExtension|Author (truncated)|Version\r\n---|---|---\r\ntheme-monokai-pro-vscode|mon|1.1.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. given any project with tsconfig.json or .git on the root of the project\r\n2. code -d <some/sub-directory>\r\n\r\n**Expected**: There shouldn't be any difference to `code -d .`\r\n\r\n**Actual**: Related features (in the example git or typescript) will not work; worse still for typescript they might cause incredibly poor experience since they give the impression \"you have an error in your code\" quite easily (which you don't!)\r\n\r\n**Fun fact** if you do `code -d <some-file>` it actually works correctly! It's only directories it flops on.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nVSCode git features, as well as far more annoyingly typescript features only really see the current opened file tree as \"the project.\" This is troublesome because it means you are always forced to open the monolithic project for anything you do (unless you want those features to just break--for typescript that means errors everywhere as it's typings break).\r\n\r\n**Why open a sub-tree?** There are many reasons, but the most important...\r\n\r\n - great when working with workspaces or multiple monitors (different sections of interest on different workspaces or monitors)\r\n - much easier to reason with when seeing a small subset (even if not split by business unit, almost all projects have a \"src\" section and the root is filled with garbage configuration files, or a folder where all the css is, different trees for server, client, whatnot etc)\r\n - sometimes for various reasons such as some sort of refactoring of files around you need multiple file trees side by side\r\n\r\n**Desirable solution**: search up until you find the key file (ie. `.git` or `tsconfig.json`)\r\n\r\nAlternatively a way to artificially shrink the entire tree to just the desired tree (so a UI only fix) also works but is far more inconvenient since it means you cant just do `code -d <some-folder>` and expect it to just work (the confusion for anyone unaware also persists). Honestly even just having some \"key\" file to tell vscode \"this is the project root\" is a better alternative (for typescript you can just burrow \"package.json\" for this purpose, ie. search up until you hit \"package.json\").\r\n\r\n**Where it gets REALLY annoying** \r\n\r\nIf you're not aware vscode is \"confused\" on the context of something like say \"typescript,\" you can easily enter a state where the editor will complain about things, that actually it shouldn't complain at all. \r\n\r\nIn my case it was related to the `.d.ts` files feature. Since it couldn't read the `tsconfig.json` it couldnt figure out where declarations I wrote were. Writing these declarations is painful enough (with all the double-triple-standards of old/new/special-god-knows-what-rules) so having the editor report \"I don't know where namespace is\" but understand X and Y types declared in the same place as the namespace because the file was open in the same instance of the editor (I guess type symbols it can grab with out the `tsconfig.json` but namespaces are special?) makes for quite the painful experience.\r\n\r\nAs a new user to typescript I can say this particular editor issue (for the time you're unware it's the editors fault) paints the worst image possible for the language: one of a language with a lot of nitpicky issues where nothing anyone (including the documentation) works and where common sense is severely lacking.\r\n\r\n*And yes if you run tsc it works, but it's easy the editor confusion to send you into a loop where you add stuff to \"fix it\" (from your perspective) in the editor, that is clearly wrong, and hence break it in tsc, then you fix it in tsc, and now the editor complains again. Repeat (until you hopefully notice the disconnect between the two).*\r\n\r\n
