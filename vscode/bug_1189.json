OSX 10.10.5 Yosemite, VS Code 0.10.1\n\nModern apps have a convention of not losing changes when the application quits and files haven't been explicitly saved. Sublime Text is particularly nice in this regard, where newly created or unsaved files are silently preserved on quit and restored when it is launched again. This would be nice for VS Code to support as well.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n1. Make changes to a file, or create a brand new unsaved file\n2. Quit VS Code\n\n**Desired Behavior**\n\nVS Code immediately quits with no prompt. After relaunching the changed file is restored with changes intact and an unsaved indicator.\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\nVS Code prompts you to save the file or discard your

seeing an issue in VS Code when debugging a TypeScript file with Source Maps that uses TypeScript Async Functions. When I set a breakpoint on the first line of the function body, the breakpoint moves to the first executable line following the end of the function body. I’m trying to determine if this is an issue with TypeScript’s SourceMap output, with VS Code, or with the version of V8 used by VS Code.  I’ve tested the same scenario in Chrome Canary and breakpoints seem to bind correctly, which leads me to believe the issue may not be with TypeScript.\n\nAfter further discussion, it looks like the issue is in the `node-debug` extension. Changing the default from `Bias.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` to `Bias.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND` seems to solve the problem.\n\nCC: @weinand \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/91/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/90","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/90/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/90/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/90/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/90","id":117662884,"number":90,"title":"Document language type","user":{"login":"cfjedimaster","id":393660,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/393660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster","html_url":"https://github.com/cfjedimaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-11-18T19:31:55Z","updated_at":"2015-11-19T12:44:41Z","closed_at":"2015-11-19T09:50:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"On this page, https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/activation-events, specifically: activationEvents.onLanguage\n\nHow does one determine the string that is valid for onLanguage?

writing pretty much all of my projects using ES6.\nSo if I want to use Code, I need to add `jsconfig.json` file that contains following snippet to every project I work on:\n\n```\n{\n
