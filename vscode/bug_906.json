VSCode doesn't display version information about languages that are used by extensions, so you have no way to know **what** is the current language version that the extension is using and **whether** the extension was tested with version 1.0, 2.0 or whatever of the language, you have to assume that the extension just works, VSCode itself doesn't even report information about TypeScript.\n\nFor example, if I want to know what version of TypeScript ships with VSCode I have to read the release docs which I do but this isn't the point and if I upgrade or downgrade I have to assume VSCode is using whatever version of TypeScript I set it up with but I have no feedback about the version the editor consumes either because the information is not exposed to the UI or not available at all.\n\n_In fact, it's odd that when you type `ext` to tasks in VSCode, VSCode tells you `no extensions found` but it actually uses many extensions under the hood, it's okay to prevent people from removing them but it should certainly allow you to list them but that's probably another issue._\n\n_**Solution:**_\n\nI didn't have the time or the chance to write an extension _yet_ so I don't know the infrastructure of VSCode so I really don't know whether something like this exists but it would be really great if VSCode had an API that authors could implement to get the version of the language they consume.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n```\nclass SomeLanguageExtension {\n    get currentLanguageVersion(): string {\n        return SomeExternalService();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen VSCode would have the ability to take advantage of this to display the version in the UI next to where you pick the language.\n\nWhat would be even better is something like this:\n\n```\nclass SomeLanguageExtension {\n    get currentLanguageVersion(): string {\n        return SomeExternalService(); // Shouldn't be hardcoded.\n    }\n\n    get supportedLanguageVersions(): string {\n        return [\"2.x\", \"3.0\", \"6.x\"]; // Hardcoded.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs far as I know an extension manager is planned for VSCode so the `supportedLanguageVersions` API can be used to tell users what are the versions of a language that the extension supports or tested against.\n\nHaving no API for this or not exposing this to the UI means authors are left to write it as part of their extension page or somewhere else or not at all and users need to look for it or ask the author that may or may not answer you, in short all I'm saying is this information needs to be transparent and crystal clear.

thoughts on this? I'd like to give this a shot at some point if everyone is cool with it. The reasons for doing so are:\n- [libsass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) is very mature and on par with the original ruby lib in terms of features\n- Significantly reduce the size and complexity of our development css files through leveraging nesting, for example this:\n  \n  ``` css\n  .monaco-workbench .panel.integrated-terminal .xterm {\n    background-color: transparent!important;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .monaco-workbench .panel.integrated-terminal .xterm:focus {\n    outline: none;\n  }\n  \n  .hc-black .monaco-workbench .panel.integrated-terminal .xterm:focus {\n    outline: 2px solid #f38518;\n  }\n  ```\n  \n  becomes:\n  \n  ``` scss\n  // In a shared file\n  $hc-outline-color: #f38518;\n  \n  .monaco-workbench .panel.integrated-terminal .xterm {\n    background-color: transparent!important;\n    position: relative;\n  \n    &:focus {\n        outline: none;\n  \n        .hc-black & {\n            outline: 2px solid $hc-outline-color;\n        }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n- We could leverage Sass variables (compile time) for non-themeable colors in addition to CSS variables for themeable colors (#8151). Sass variables can also be used for reusable images, media queries, margins, etc.\n- Use of `//` comments are not included in compiled CSS, meaning we can add more documentation to complex styles without worrying about it ending up in the resulting file\n- Mixins for commonly used styles/media queries/etc.\n- It's way more fun to write in Sass\n\n/cc @bgashler1

version, based on feedback from PR #8238.\n\nChanges:\n- Removed scroll decoration modifications (they are default now)\n- Removed gradient trick and now instead use the viewlet background color so the tab well still is different from the find/replace.  The first tab with its own background, in turn, is able to differentiate the tab well from the viewlet, so everything is clearly separated.\n- Made inactive tabs have their own background color that is different from tab well.\n\nThis also addresses all feedback in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8564\n\nThanks @bpasero and @isidorn for your feedback.  I'm sure we can continue refining this in July.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8586","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8586/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8586/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8586/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/8586","id":163226609,"number":8586,"title":"Emmet: show error when the path is located outside the current workspace","user":{"login":"mrmlnc","id":7034281,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7034281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrmlnc","html_url":"https://github.com/mrmlnc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrmlnc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrmlnc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrmlnc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrmlnc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrmlnc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrmlnc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrmlnc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrmlnc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrmlnc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/22","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/22","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/22/labels","id":1837472,"number":22,"title":"July 2016","description":"","creator":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":392,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-06-20T07:57:10Z","updated_at":"2016-08-12T09:02:26Z","due_on":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-08-12T09:02:26Z"},"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-06-30T17:57:36Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T14:52:44Z","closed_at":"2016-07-01T14:52:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/pulls/8586","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/8586","diff_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/8586.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/8586.patch"},"body":"Source: #8569\n#### Description\n\nJust show error when the path is located outside the current workspace.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7034281/16498683/8f0ff68e-3f05-11e6-8bc0-2237f7f35ce3.png)\n#### About `createPath` function\n\nIt's not necessary to check.

Press ctrl-k twice.\n\nIn any standard OSX text area, this results in the text 'a' being killed, then the second kill deletes the empty line.\nIn VS Code, the 'a' gets killed, but the second kill has no effect.\n\nAs a user habituated to the standard text commands, this is very annoying, because it prevents me from quickly deleting multiple lines of text; instead, I have to alternate between ctrl-k and ctrl-d.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8574","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8574/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8574/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8574/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8574","id":163185336,"number":8574,"title":"Ctrl-t (transpose) command inserts extra character.","user":{"login":"gwk","id":406380,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/406380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwk","html_url":"https://github.com/gwk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":335611370,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/beginner","name":"beginner","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":256129996,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"fef2c0","default":true},{"id":310845685,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"006b75","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":17,"created_at":"2016-06-30T14:52:15Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T03:07:45Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:\n  Version 1.3.0-insider (1.3.0-insider)\n  a21c12346f388e51858c930875ca30968604c116\n  2016-06-30T05:01:53.185Z\n- OS Version:\n  OSX 10.11.5 (15F34)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
