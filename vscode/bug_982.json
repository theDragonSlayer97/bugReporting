VSCode Version: 1.1.0-insider\n- OS Version: Arch Linux (kernel 4.5.4-ck)\n\nHi,\n\nI installed VSCode using [this PKGBUILD](https://github.com/fusion809/PKGBUILDs/visual-studio-code-oss/PKGBUILD) and while VSCode seems to be running fine, I have noticed that whenever I try to install extensions in the command pallette by typing `ext install ...` (where `...` is the extension's name) I get the result \"No extensions found\". To get some debugging information I ran `scripts/code.sh`, which returned (only including the last few lines of code as they are those that include an error):\n\n``` bash\natever hasn't been checked yet\n[22:51:17] [tsb] time: 24351ms mem: 659MB Δ621\n*** Finished with 0 errors.\n[22:51:19] Finished 'compile-client' after 30 s\n[22:51:19] Starting 'compile'...\n[22:51:19] Finished 'compile' after 7.43 μs\n[14903:0512/225119:ERROR:browser_main_loop.cc(217)] Running without the SUID sandbox!

How do I fix it? Is there some command I should have run while building VSCode besides `scripts/npm.sh install` and `gulp vscode-linux-x64`. \n\nThanks for your
