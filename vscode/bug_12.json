Write code that depends on typings or a module that isn't installed yet or isn't yet correct.\r\n2. Install the correct typings or module, and then find yourself struggling to get the Problems panes to update for all the open files (eventually finding multi-step solutions).\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\nI originally asked for help with this on SO: [Refreshing errors in VSC after installing typings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46461014/refreshing-errors-in-vsc-after-installing-typings)\r\n\r\nI eventually found a solution: Map Command+R (on a Mac) or Control+R (on Windows) to `workbench.action.reloadWindow`. Now all I have to do to refresh the errors is to hit the same key combo I would in any browser to refresh the page.\r\n\r\nAmazingly, it seems that Command+R and Control+R are not already mapped on Mac and Windows.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTION: Add this to the default mappings, in order to make users' lives easier.

Why is \"XML DOCUMENT\", which is a panel that shows an XML document's structure, visible when I don't have an XML document open? Why doesn't it automatically open when I view an XML document? Why isn't there a command palette command to show/hide it? Why is there a panel dedicated to XML instead of a generic \"editor structure\" panel, anyway? I have many questions.)\r\n\r\nI can right-click and select \"Remove from Sidebar\", and they go away, until I open another window. I have to repeat this process for every new window I open.

It's extremely annoying since it doesn't change the cursor and a copy of a viable chunk of code wouldn't normally trigger linter to complain or even produce a runtime error, but it surely would mess with the output. I only notice it when reviewing my changes in GIT or when this happens after dragging text very short distances, like into the next/prev line. But 3+ lines away it is already easy to miss. \r\n\r\nI don't know how to repro it - happens to me maybe once-twice per work session. I've only noticed that when I do notice this behavior, as long as I don't \"disturb\" it - it keeps on going, i.e. if I just copied a piece of text this way, if I don't select another chunk or press ctrl or change the tab - every subsequent drag-moving of this still selected piece of text would create a new copy. My first reaction to this is \"oh, my ctrl key probably stuck\" so I press it a couple of times and it \"helps\" but as I said, the cursor doesn't even change and there would be a multitude of other things happening if it ware a stuck key, since typing would turn into hotkeying.\r\n\r\nThank you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35453/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35452","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35452/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35452/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35452/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35452","id":261909094,"number":35452,"title":"Changing editor.fontSize has no effet.","user":{"login":"iyedb","id":643030,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/643030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyedb","html_url":"https://github.com/iyedb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyedb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyedb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyedb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyedb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyedb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyedb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyedb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyedb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyedb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-10-01T11:18:09Z","updated_at":"2017-10-01T12:32:40Z","closed_at":"2017-10-01T12:32:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

When activating the extension, \"get\" the workspace value:\r\n```typescript\r\n'use strict';\r\nimport * as vscode from 'vscode';\r\nexport function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {\r\n    const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('configtest');\r\n\r\n    // The default value is set to 0 despite not being set in package.json\r\n    const defaultValue = config.inspect('number').defaultValue;\r\n\r\n    // As a consequence, the 5 here is ignored\r\n    const value = config.get('number', 5);\r\n\r\n    vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`defaultValue = ${defaultValue} / value = ${value}`);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected:** The info message reads `defaultValue = undefined / value = 5`\r\n\r\n**Actual:** The info message reads `defaultValue = 0 / value = 0`\r\n\r\nThe code for [`workspaceConfiguration.get`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/feded35e7a23d17ab1ff69089f3ead2a883fff50/src/vs/workbench/api/node/extHostConfiguration.ts#L82) only uses the default value passed in to the `get` function if the lookup value is `undefined`, but that seems impossible to do. If I omit `default` in `package.json`, the default value for the data type is used (0, [], {}, \"\", etc.) and I can't put `undefined` in the `package.json`.\r\n\r\nYou can see my repro code [here](https://github.com/hoovercj/vscode-api-playground/tree/master/ConfigurationTest).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35450","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35450/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35450/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35450/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35450","id":261904531,"number":35450,"title":"Workspace-level key bindings?","user":{"login":"jez9999","id":793830,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/793830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jez9999","html_url":"https://github.com/jez9999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jez9999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jez9999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jez9999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jez9999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jez9999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jez9999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jez9999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jez9999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jez9999/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":297959291,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/keybindings","name":"keybindings","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"sandy081","id":10746682,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10746682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081","html_url":"https://github.com/sandy081","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandy081/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-10-01T09:44:45Z","updated_at":"2017-10-03T11:53:32Z","closed_at":"2017-10-03T05:53:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think support should be introduced for a keybindings.json in the project's `.vscode` folder which would override globally-defined key bindings.
