adding the ability to run console apps to Dart Code and trying to figure out the best way to do it. With the current implementation runs the process is hidden and stdin is routed to the debug console. I'm worried about how this would affect reading input (such as keypresses) from the user and not behaving the same as if it was run from a traditional shell.\n\nI did a little bit of testing with the Posh and C# extensions and I was surprised not only because they do the same, but because the C# one seemed to totally fail on Console.ReadLine and Console.ReadKey!\n\nSo I wondered whether there was any guidance on this? I was originally expected it to work like a console app in Fat VS - a new window spawns and it works just like I'd executed it from the Windows Run dialog. I'd like to keep things consistent with other Code experiences, but not being able to read from stdin correctly seems like a serious flaw.\n\nAdvice welcome!\n\nFindings:\n### C# (.NET Core)\n\nEmbeds in the debug window but appears to:\n- Hang on `Console.ReadLine` (typing into the debug window always behaves like a REPL, so you can't provide any input to `ReadLine`!)\n- Exception thrown on `Console.ReadKey`: `'System.InvalidOperationException' in System.Console.dll`\n### PowerShell\n\nAlso embeds in debug window:\n- `Read-Host` works!\n- Input box works as a REPL when the process is suspended/at a breakpoint but otherwise gets sent to STDIN\n- Reading a single key does not work (though that's done a bit weird in PoSh - `$Host.UI.RawUI.ReadKey('NoEcho,IncludeKeyDown')`)\n- `Write-Progress` doesn't fail, but doesn't show progress (this is expected behaviour, `Write-Process` is designed not to crash when a host doesn't support it)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10513","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10513/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10513/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10513/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10513","id":171052875,"number":10513,"title":"Too fast vertical scrolling in terminal with font Ubuntu Mono or with larger font size","user":{"login":"mirao","id":12584138,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/12584138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirao","html_url":"https://github.com/mirao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-08-14T10:38:28Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T20:12:40Z","closed_at":"2016-08-15T16:49:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04\n- HW: HP Envy 13\" Skylake, with touchpad\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n1.

Made a pull request for that in the [TypeScript.tmLanguage](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage/pull/225) repository but it seems that it's somehow out of maintenance and no one noticed it (also I see that my additions have syntax issues...) so I made a same change here with correct syntax and stuff.\n\nAs always hope it have helped.\nHave so much fun!\nPouya\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10497","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10497/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10497/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10497/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10497","id":171001060,"number":10497,"title":"Cannot
