VSCode Version: 1.5.3\n- OS Version: OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open search sidebar\n2. Enter search term\n3. do a search\n\nSometimes vscode will do a search, you can see the progress bar progressing, but then it stops about 10 pixels before the end and no results show up. If I restart vscode and perform the same search again it finds things just fine.\n\nI've also noticed that search is really slow in general (I have a beefy mac book pro), which is really annoying with quick open (`cmd+p`) as it can take more than half a minute to find a file that way. Even if I type in the exact filename (sublimetext is instantaneous on the same project (with less folders excluded) and I feel it does better fuzzy matching).\n\nOur project is relatively big, but I've excluded almost everything so I'm only dealing with about 3000 files (mix of JS, python, java, protobufs, less, images, etc).\n\nHappy to provide more details if you need them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12743/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12742","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12742/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12742/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12742/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12742","id":179456060,"number":12742,"title":"Goto
