Cursor jumps \"backwards\" and finds term before original cursor position - this is counterintuitive (so \"next\" means \"before\"?).\n\nThis request is to have an option to have `actions.find` and `editor.action.nextMatchFindAction` to search forward in the file only.

As i figured out VScode doesn't use gtk for window decorations, so i tried xprop to change theme variant to dark. What i got is that window decoration changed to dark, but menu is still using old light style.\n\nIt would be great if VScode will start to use CSD (client side decorations) like in most native and not native gnome apps, so i request this feature too\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n0. Use light gtk theme, that support dark variant, like Arc-GTK\n1. Type in terminal: xprop -f _GTK_THEME_VARIANT 8u -set _GTK_THEME_VARIANT \"dark\"\n2. Click VScode window\n3.

In _Notepad++_ it is CTRL+D.
