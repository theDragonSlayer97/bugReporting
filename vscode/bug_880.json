This is sane default behavior, but given that the terminal already autolinks to files in error lines (which by the way is absolutely fantastic!), it would be wonderful if it could scroll to the first error line.\n\nMy reasoning is that for a stream of build errors, it is best to address the first one by default, which is the least likely to be a spurious or secondary error.\n\nIs it possible to configure a scrolling behavior for the integrated terminal, either as part of the task or perhaps a keystroke?\n\nAs always, thanks for the great

working on a subset of files. For example, I usually work with VSCode open to the root of our repo (with many projects in it) and I am lately finding myself needing to update common things across the projects (say in package.json, project.json, etc), so right now I have to either scroll around in the explorer pane or use Goto->File -- which forces me to have to type the file name in over an over. If I could just filter the explorer pane to show all project.json files it would be quick and painless.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9372","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9372/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9372/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9372/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9372","id":165893253,"number":9372,"title":"Allow to search commands by keybinding in command palette","user":{"login":"dilijev","id":494055,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/494055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilijev","html_url":"https://github.com/dilijev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilijev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilijev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilijev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilijev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilijev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilijev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilijev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilijev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilijev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-07-15T23:08:41Z","updated_at":"2017-05-25T21:06:40Z","closed_at":"2017-05-25T17:46:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.4.0-insider (4d0b2f5f15bf7011d3a99888763a7b46a5953d95, 2016-07-15T12:35:33.467Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14372\n\nDiscovered the want for this when I typed Ctrl+B instead of Ctrl+V and triggered the Toggle Sidebar Visibility command .

VSCode Version: 1.4.0-insider\n- OS Version: Mac\n- TypeScript Version: 2.0\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n1. Set a break point on a line of TypeScript code in an async function that uses the await keyword on the Promise result of another async function. Example:`const result = await doSomethingAsync(); console.log(result);`\n2. Start debugging in VS Code by selecting a related launch profile in a TypScript project. See my example snippet below.\n3. Run necessary code so that the debugger is stopped on the breakpoint from step 1.\n4. Press F10 to step over the `doSomethingAsync` function.\n\n**Example**\n\n``` javascript\nclass Foo {\n   async do() {\n     console.log('before');\n     const result = await doSomethingAsync(); //<= set breakpoint here\n     console.log('after', result); // <= hit F10 and notice it doesn't go here\n   }\n}\n```\n\n**Expected Result**\nIt would proceed to the `console.log('after', result);`\n\n**Actual Result**\nIt jumps the end of the function. In order to debug, you have to put a breakpoint on every like inside that async function.\n\nThis issue was discussed [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4798) regarding step into and was resolved by @weinand but did not address the jump issue after testing the new fix.\n\n**Demo**\n- Pull [petstore](https://github.com/swimlane/node-microservice-demo/tree/master/petstore)\n- Set a breakpoint [here](https://github.com/swimlane/node-microservice-demo/blob/master/petstore/src/controllers/PetStoreController.ts#L28)\n- Run Launch in VSCode\n- Goto `localhost:8080/pets` in your browser and observe as you step into and over each function.\n\n**Further Details**\nThe issue actually presents itself in both TypeScript and Babel situations. This issue has been raised to Source Map team, Babel, Mozilla, Chrome Debugging and to TC39. See:\n- https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/issues/221\n- http://discuss.babeljs.io/t/async-await-debugging-issues/132\n- https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait/issues/93\n-
