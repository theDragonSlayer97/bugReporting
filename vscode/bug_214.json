[A guideline of Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742466.aspx#hand) states that this cursor is **used for text and graphics links because of their weak affordance**. [Another one](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/input-and-devices/mouse-interactions#cursors) recommends us to **use hover effects** for clickable elements instead (currently we have hover effects for list items and some of the buttons, but not for tabs).
