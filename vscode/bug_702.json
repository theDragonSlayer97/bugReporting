implemented entirely in the debug adapter, with a new option in the launch config, and I hope to do that to try it out. But when I've used it, I've found it most useful when I can mark a script as \"library code\" on the fly. For this, we would need a context menu option on the callstack which can mark/unmark a particular script as library code, debug protocol support, and a toggle button to globally enable/disable the feature. (For the last item, we could use the 'exceptionBreakpointFilters' - is there anything wrong with reusing that for something besides exception breakpoints?) We also need to persist these.\r\n\r\nThis is implemented by the chrome debugging protocol. For reference it looks like this - https://chromedevtools.github.io/debugger-protocol-viewer/v8/Debugger/#method-setBlackboxPatterns - but we really just need a message that includes a DebugProtocol.Source and the library code state.
