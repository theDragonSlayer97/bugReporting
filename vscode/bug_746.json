For example I have 2 files with same name but in different folders:\n   - C:\\Users\\a\\foo\\test\\a.txt\n   - C:\\Users\\a\\bar\\test\\a.txt\n2. Open them.\n3. ![vsc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21136418/19220673/12d3c35a-8e5d-11e6-9fa4-6a7f66b22b7e.png)\n\nSo I have 2 suggestions:\n1. Would you please add option to shorten file paths so that they will be shown like this?\n   - foo\\test\n   - bar\\test\n2. Would you add option to shorten file path if it's too long, like 300 pixels? For example, you can use the ellipsize character `…`.\n\nIt would help a lot, since my project is located in a deep sub folder.

There is a copyLineDown right now which are nice but doesn't copy the selection, just entire line.\n\nThere's also another issue that tracks a bunch of shortcuts, including this one but only for mac.
