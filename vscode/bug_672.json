VSCode Version: 1.7.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nThis is a fun one... I use a Programmer-DVORAK layout, and the autocomplete commits whenever I type the letter `v`. The issue goes away if I switch back to QWERTY. It is pretty clear what is happening here; the `v` on DVORAK (or Programmer-DVORAK) is where the period is on QWERTY, which is intentionally meant to complete the autocorrect.\r\n\r\nThis is odd behaviour since the editor handles all the keys properly when typing and using hotkeys, but for some reason fails to distinguish the character being typed here. It also might be good to note that it still inserts the letter v after the committed word, not a period. I also noticed that the standard behaviour of committing the suggestion *does not* happen when hitting the DVORAK's period, it just inserts a period.\r\n\r\nAlso, if it makes a difference, the version of Programmer-DVORAK I am using is set to use QWERTY hotkeys, similar to the DVORAK-QWERTY layout that comes native on OS X.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Enable Programmer-DVORAK on your computer (normal DVORAK would probably cause the issue as well. I have a Programmer-DVORAK keyboard layout file on Windows that I created for anybody that would like it)\r\n2. Create a new TypeScript file with a class in it.\r\n3. Attempt to add a private property.\r\n4. Notice that it commits to the suggestion of \"print\" when you get to the v, resulting in the final word you get being \"printv.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, is there a way to disable this behaviour when pressing period? I can't find a setting for it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15623","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15623/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15623/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15623/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15623","id":189956228,"number":15623,"title":"Preview

VSCode Version: 1.6.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nWe've got this bug in Visual Studio for Windows and I noticed that VS Code has it as well. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Paste following code in VSCode. It's C# code, but it repros in any file. \r\n```CSharp\r\nList<string> test = new List<string>();\r\ntest.Add(\"辻󠄁\"); // 辻󠄁 8FBB DB40 DD01\r\ntest.Add(\"辻\"); // 辻 8FBB\r\ntest.Add(\"辻󠄀\"); // 辻󠄀 8FBB DB40 DD00\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Place cursor to right of either first or third 辻󠄀\r\n\r\n3. Press backspace\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**: The entire character should be removed as it does in Notepad and Microsoft Word\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**: The right two bytes are removed from the buffer but 8FBB remains.\r\n\r\nThese characters are not valid within the context of most C# code (variable/method names) but are legal within comments and strings where they may be more likely to occur in the future.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that these characters cause issues with left and right arrow movements. I'm not sure if it's worth opening a separate issue for this, though.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15621","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15621/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15621/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15621/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15621","id":189949265,"number":15621,"title":"Cannot
