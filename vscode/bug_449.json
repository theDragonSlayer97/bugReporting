VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: macOS Sierra\r\n\r\nwhen I run my \"test\" task in terminal and Panel is hidden, then the output in the terminal is wrapped, it looks like this (new line after 80 chars):\r\n```\r\nChrome 56.0.2924 (Mac OS X 10.12.3): Executed 1 of 6546 (skipped 6545) SUCCESS (\r\n2.99 secs / 0.015 secs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when I run the task with opened Panel, then the output is as it should be - non-wrapped. It looks like this:\r\n```\r\nChrome 56.0.2924 (Mac OS X 10.12.3): Executed 1 of 6546 (skipped 6545) SUCCESS (3.122 secs / 0.018 secs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be just a styling issue, but the bigger problem is, that if one has a custom `problemMatcher` which normally matches one line and it is wrapped by hidden Panel, then the matcher never finishes and no other task can be run (and \"slashes\" indicator \\/\\/is the bottom left of the Code is spinning and spinning and ...). Once it also crashed whole Code.\r\n\r\nMy `problemMatcher` to matching problems generated by Chrome when running JS tests by Karma runner:\r\n```\r\n\"problemMatcher\": {\r\n    \"fileLocation\": \"absolute\",\r\n    \"pattern\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"regexp\": \"(Expected.+\\\\.)$\",\r\n            \"message\": 1\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"regexp\":

VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: macOS Sierra\r\n\r\nWhen you have a custom theme which defines a custom color for `wordHighlight` (i.e. for occurrences of e.g. local variable inside a function), then if you click on such variable and when it has a matching usage inside the scope, then `wordHighlight` color is properly set to all occurrences. \r\n\r\nSo far so good. But if you start \"selection\" (by mouse drag) inside that \"active\" variable, then the \"selected\" part of the variable is NOT replaced by \"selection\" color.\r\n\r\nIt does not work in [Sample Light Theme](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/blob/master/theme-sample/Sample_Light.tmTheme) either.

I tried it again recently after not using for a while and it has improved significantly.  That being said, I have a couple thoughts regarding the look, feel, and key usage of the terminal.\r\n\r\n1) Rather than having the tabs for Problems, Output, Debug Console, and Terminal be at the top, why not put them at the side or bottom and then convert the terminal drop down list to tabs?  This would allow 1 click to switch between tabs vs 2.\r\n2) The dropdown list currently displays a list of processes, however, I like giving my terminals custom names in OS-X.  The drop down list does not appear to honor these names. (they are set using: `printf '\\033]0;title\\007'\"`.\r\n3) It would be great if you could use a custom theme just for the terminal.  While I use the default theme for VSCode, I would like the background to be black for the terminal to provide cleaner separation.\r\n4) When closing a terminal and the default shell isn't the current active process, it would be great if you could pop up a warning message.  I've accidentally closed terminals with running processes in them...leaving the process orphaned.  I then have to go in and kill the process manually. \r\n\r\nJust a few thoughts.

[The most promising tc39 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-cancelable-promises) has been withdrawn (which used `CancellationToken`s), bluebird has cancellable promises and RxJS Observables are cancellable.\r\n\r\nVS Code uses `CancellationToken` from C# for cancellation. They are also used in the TS Server, vscode-jsonrpc and vscode-languageserver. Currently, this comes down to just two classes: `CancellationToken` and `CancellationTokenSource`. These classes seem to be duplicated in the code of every of the above examples. This imposes a problem, because one of the biggest concerns with cancellations is what a promise should resolve to when it is cancelled - typically it is rejected with a `CancelledError`, and code needs to differentiate between a true error and a cancellation in eg `catch` blocks. The TS Server for example does define its own `OperationCancelledException` (which weirdly doesn't inherit from `Error`). If every API defines its own classes and there is no uniform interface, it is impossible to do proper checks for CancellationErrors in catch blocks (eg with `instanceof` or some other type check).\r\n\r\nAdding to that, the implementation is lacking basic features that were discussed in the tc39 proposal and available in C#, for example composition of CancelTokens. It is a basic use case to combine multiple CancellationTokens, creating a new CancellationTokenSource from an existing CancellationToken or `throwIfRequested()`.\r\n\r\nMoving cancellation into a standalone open source library that anyone could use would greatly improve the interoperability between APIs and allow to easily add more features that improve usage ergonomics.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22318/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22317","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22317/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22317/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22317/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22317","id":213110993,"number":22317,"title":"Use Windows Subsystem for Linux as integrated terminal","user":{"login":"NCC1701M","id":7260053,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7260053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NCC1701M","html_url":"https://github.com/NCC1701M","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NCC1701M/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NCC1701M/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NCC1701M/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NCC1701M/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NCC1701M/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NCC1701M/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NCC1701M/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NCC1701M/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NCC1701M/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-09T17:34:55Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T19:10:12Z","closed_at":"2017-03-09T19:10:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: Win10 1607\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
