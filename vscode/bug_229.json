But a `path` based Source with a `deemphasized` hint still opens fine.\r\n\r\nA `hint` on a Source is a pure **presentation style** and should not result in any different behaviour. So there should be no code in VS Code that depends on the value of the `hint` attribute other than rendering code.

I've been using Webstorm for developing angular projects with typescript and I wanted to make the change to VS Code. There is one key feature that doesn't seem to be working or to be there at all in VS Code, which is the easy go-to-definition of a template file (html) or style file (css). When I'm editing a component in Webstorm, I can Ctrl + Click on the templateUrl's relative path and it opens the file right away.\r\n\r\nIn VS Code, the go-to-definition on a templateUrl gives me a \"No definition found for 'component'\". Is it a feature lacking, or just a bug?\r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n![vscodegotodefinition](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1496661/27254566-c29f0658-5358-11e7-92ae-863863776944.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: Code 1.13.1 (379d2efb5539b09112c793d3d9a413017d736f89, 2017-06-14T18:21:47.485Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|vscode-angular2-files|alexiv|1.3.8|\r\n|vscode-eslint|dbaeumer|1.2.11|\r\n|python|donjayamanne|0.6.5|\r\n|tslint|eg2|0.15.0|\r\n|beautify|HookyQR|1.1.1|\r\n|debugger-for-chrome|msjsdiag|3.1.4|\r\n|language-vscode-javascript-angular2|nwallace|0.0.11|\r\n|autoimport|steoates|1.2.2|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

as a developer (many times as a matter of fact) I need to have multiple windows open, which makes it worse, is the fact that most of the time these windows contain projects written in the same language (Ionic / Angular in my particular case), so all of the projects look mostly the same when you look at the explorer pane. So, basically the only clue I have to know which project is open in the current window, is to look at the folder name in the top of the Explorer pane, --- at least for me, and I bet that for many developers, this is counterintuitive and distracting, it is not the product's fault, VS Code is by far the very best product of its kind in the market (in my opinion way better than the bulky full Visual Studio suite), however, having different windows with different colors, would allow me to work seamlessly with many projects in mac and linux using virtual desktops, which would be the ideal workflow for me.\r\n\r\nI have seen that having multiple windows open and installing a new theme in one window, has the side effect that sometimes the theme is not automatically updated in the other windows, this is obviously not intended, but is the say in which until now I have had to tackle this little inconvenience of not having this feature out of the box.\r\n\r\nI would love you even more
