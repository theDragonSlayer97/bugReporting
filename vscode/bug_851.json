\"autoClosingPairs\": [\n    [\"(|\", \"|)\"],   // fails       \n    [\"[|\", \"|]\"],   // works\n    [ \"(*\", \"*)\" ]  // works\n  ]\n```\n\nThere are some hacky workarounds but each one introduces a different kind of undesirable behavior\n\n``` js\n  \"autoClosingPairs\": [\n   [\"[\", \"]\"],      // works\n   [\"(\", \")\"],      // works\n   [\"(|\", \"|\"],     // fails\n   [\"[<\",\">\"],      // works\n   [\"[|\", \"|\"],     // fails\n   [ \"(*\", \"*\" ],   // fails \n   [\"<@\", \"@>\"],    // works \n   [\"<@@\", \"@\"]     // fails              \n  ]\n```\n\nThe `<@@ , @` case fails differently than the others which simply refuse to complete.\n`|` is representing the cursor in the following example\n`<@|` -> `<@|@>` -> `<@@|>` \nthe second key input of `@`, it overwrites the `@` that was generated by the completion\n\nThis approach creates another issue where if there is already a `[` in the editor and you type `<` next to it, it completes to `[<>`\n\nInserting a space after the first character works in some instances but not others\n\n``` js\n  \"autoClosingPairs\": [\n   [\"[ \", \"]\"],      // fails\n   [\"( \", \")\"],      // works\n   [\"(|\", \"|)\"],     // fails\n   [\"[<\",\">]\"],      // works\n   [\"[|\", \"|]\"],     // works\n   [ \"(*\", \"*)\" ],   // works\n   [\"<@ \", \"@>\"],    // fails \n   [\"<@@\", \"@@>\"]    // works              \n  ]\n```\n\nBut even if this were to work in all of these instances it'd still be an undesirable approach since `()` is an operator keyword in F# and more often than not a space following `[` or `(` is undesirable\n- VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Pro | Version 1607 | OS Build

i think, single option \n    **\"editor.referenceInfos\": true**\nfor 'references', 'run test' and 'debug test' is not useful.\n\nWhat if i need to run test from the vscode, but i very don't like 'references'? \n\nPlease, split these options to something like \n    **\"editor.referenceInfos\": true**\n    **\"editor.debuggingCommands\": true**\n\nThank you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10237","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10237/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10237/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10237/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10237","id":169746651,"number":10237,"title":"任务终止不了","user":{"login":"1002237913","id":4089290,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4089290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1002237913","html_url":"https://github.com/1002237913","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1002237913/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1002237913/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1002237913/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1002237913/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1002237913/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1002237913/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1002237913/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1002237913/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1002237913/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":287991608,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/important","name":"important","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":292032114,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/tasks","name":"tasks","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":291057332,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/verified","name":"verified","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/23/labels","id":1854621,"number":23,"title":"August

VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: OS X 10.11.6\n\nRight now, the keyboard shortcut for Find Across Files (cmd+shift+F) functions as a toggle (even though the command name is just 'workbench.view.search'). If you are not focused on the search pane, hitting the combo will open it and focus there. Otherwise, it will restore the focus to previous area.\n\nI find this incredibly awkward because I want the keyboard shortcut to always bring me to Search Across Files, rather than sometimes bringing me _away_ from there if that's where my focus already happens to be and I don't notice. Frequently, I assume the focus is in a text pane (the visual distinction is not terribly obvious) and hit cmd+shift+F, and begin typing but because the focus was actually already in the search box, I just ended up toggling back to the editor and entering a bunch of text that I didn't want to enter. It's worse if I happen to have something selected.\n\nIt's conceivable that this toggling behavior is helpful to some people sometimes but it would be nice to at least have the option of disabling it. I attempted to override keyboard shortcuts so that cmd+shift+f only worked when: \"editorTextFocus\" but it had no effect.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4511","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"BBCC:366E:77C5BF:FC69E4:59D9425E","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=852>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=850>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"6a89b74bde4cf9e511bf4916d3326b18\"","status":"200 OK"}}
