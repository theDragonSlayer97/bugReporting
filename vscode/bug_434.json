VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: MacOs 10.12.3\r\n\r\nForgive me if this isn't an actual bug, but the guidance [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/node-debugging#_source-maps) suggests that if adding a `debugger;` statement in my code works but adding a breakpoint doesn't, there might be a bug.\r\n\r\nThe setup:\r\n\r\n- Node/Express app\r\n- Webpack transpiling ES5\r\n\r\nIf this does indeed sound like a bug as opposed to a problem with my config, let me know and I'll get to work producing a minimum test case.\r\n\r\nI've got the following `launch.json`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n  \"configurations\": [    \r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"Attach remote\",\r\n        \"type\": \"node\",\r\n        \"request\": \"attach\",\r\n        \"protocol\": \"inspector\",\r\n        \"outFiles\": [\r\n            \"${workspaceRoot}/{dist,node_modules}/**/*.js\",\r\n        ],\r\n        \"port\": 5858,\r\n        \"restart\": true,\r\n        \"address\": \"localhost\",\r\n        \"localRoot\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\r\n        \"remoteRoot\": \"/usr/src/app/\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the relevant bit of my package.json:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"stack:debug\": \"docker-compose -f docker-compose-development.yml up\",\r\n    \"debug\": \" NODE_ENV=development nodemon --inspect=5858 index.js\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `stack:debug` simply brings up all the services needed to run the application in Docker containers – including bringing up a node app by calling `npm run debug` as the `CMD` in the Dockerfile.\r\n\r\nIf I bring up my stack of services in Docker _except_ my Node app, and then `npm run debug` (to run in my host's Node), I can connect to Node and debug as expected. However, if I bring up the service in a container (using `npm start stack:debug`), manually adding a `debugger;` statement causes code to break execution; however, a breakpoint in VS Code does not.\r\n\r\nWebpack is outputting the compiled files with inline source maps into `./dist`. I'm reasonably confident that I've got the `localRoot` and `remoteRoot` correct as, if I muck about with them at all, my breakpoints go grey. However, nothing I change with `outFiles` or `outDir` seems to make a difference, so I'm assuming that my problem is here somewhere.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22760","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22760/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22760/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22760/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22760","id":214847293,"number":22760,"title":"Hover
