VSCode Version: 1.7.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Insider Preview build 14971\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Find a Windows 10 PC with dual monitors. I suspect that the two monitors must have different DPI/scaling settings.\r\n2. Run VS Code on one monitor.\r\n3. Drag a file from Windows' File Explorer into the explorer pane in Code.\r\n4. Either:\r\n    - The file is successfully copied to the open folder in Code and the application resets to normal. If so, move VS Code to the other monitor and restart at step 1.\r\n    - The file is not copied, and the explorer pane maintains the light background that indicated that it was a drop surface. Clicking out of the pane or selecting other items does not resolve this state, and one must reload the workspace.\r\n\r\nI have a primary 4K monitor at 150% DIP scaling and a 1080p monitor at 100%. I see this issue when Code is on my secondary monitor, but not when it's on my primary. It looks like some variety of coordinate translation isn't working correctly and as a result the drop event doesn't register; this leaves it in a \"limbo\" state waiting to receive an event.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that, when this bug is encountered, everything _looks_ normal until the drop doesn't register. The app successfully detects the drag beginning and highlights the drop area as expected. This is how it looks afterward:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3310349/20864745/37df5bb8-b9b0-11e6-9ccb-f8a2f05bf9e8.png)\r\n\r\nThere are no useful log items in the dev console. Unfortunately, I can't get a GIF of this because the apps I normally use for that have issues with DPI transitions too :laughing:","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16452","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16452/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16452/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16452/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16452","id":193336708,"number":16452,"title":"My extension crashed so bad that uninstalling and reinstalling it doesn't work","user":{"login":"johnfn","id":167745,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/167745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnfn","html_url":"https://github.com/johnfn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnfn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnfn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnfn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnfn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnfn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnfn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnfn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnfn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnfn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-12-04T07:14:03Z","updated_at":"2016-12-09T13:36:21Z","closed_at":"2016-12-09T13:36:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've been developing VSCodeVim, and the recent version has locked up - it doesn't respond to any extension-specific keystrokes.
