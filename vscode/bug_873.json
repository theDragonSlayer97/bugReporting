replace __electricCharacterSupport.docComment with an entry in characterPair.\n   The ElectricCharacterSupport is doing two things:\n   - Auto indentation based on the configured brackets.\n   - autoPair for doc comments (on `/**` it adds `*/`).\n\nIt has been updated to look at the character pairs and to take care of all brackets that are longer than one character. In the future it would be good to split the `ElectricCharacterSupport` and add the autoPair functionality to `characterPairs.ts`\n2. Extend the language configuration files to also accept the `notIn` patterns. By documenatation (and schema) the only valid values in `notIn` are 'string' and 'comment' (not enforced in code yet)\n3. Add a JSON schema for language configuration files. To make this useful we need a common file name pattern for language configuration files. I chose `*language-configuration.json`\n4. Migrate all uses of the __ properties to use language configuration files.\n5. Rename existing language configuration files to `language-configuration.json`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9594","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9594/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9594/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9594/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9594","id":166889416,"number":9594,"title":"Editor prompts me to configure exclude","user":{"login":"elsigh","id":517210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/517210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elsigh","html_url":"https://github.com/elsigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elsigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elsigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elsigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elsigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elsigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elsigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elsigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elsigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elsigh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":286886536,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":47,"created_at":"2016-07-21T18:41:44Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T20:15:34Z","closed_at":"2016-12-02T23:08:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.3.1\n- OS Version: Mac OSX El Capitan 10.11.5\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
