I've taken the opportunity to list the most important issue of making the editor a succes below.\r\n\r\n# Show stoppers:\r\n\r\n1. Enable PSReadline support in the integrated console (syntax highlighting, keyboard navigation) (PowerShell/vscode-powershell#535)\r\n   See IntelliSense in debug mode is behaving strange (PowerShell/vscode-powershell#948)\r\n2.

#31448 on Ubuntu Linux 16.04\r\n\r\nHere's my extension's contribution:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n        \"configuration\": {\r\n            \"properties\": {\r\n                \"banana.brand\": {\r\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\r\n                    \"scope\": \"workbench\"\r\n                },\r\n                \"banana.resourceBrand\": {\r\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\r\n                    \"scope\": \"resource\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's what I get as the description for `scope` when contributing a configuration:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22350/28663939-1b6714d0-72bf-11e7-8a4f-b6bfdda08dff.png)\r\n\r\n> Scope in which the configuration is applicable. `workbench` scope defines configuration can be applied everywhere. `resource` scope defines configuration is applied only to folders and files.\r\n\r\nI was very puzzled by this.\r\n\r\nAs I debugged my extension I opened VS Code in 3 separate windows:\r\n\r\n- With no folder scope, I was able to set both settings in user settings\r\n- With a folder opened, I was able to set both settings in user and workspace settings\r\n- With a workspace opened, I was able to set both settings in user and workspace settings. When attempting to set them in one of my folder settings, I get the info, greyed-out decoration on `banana.brand`\r\n\r\nSo, it seems to me we're having a communication problem. The Intellisense description makes me think that the `resource` scope is more restricted than the `workbench` scope. And it turns out it's actually the other way around: if I contribute a `workbench` scoped configuration, I won't be able to change its value per folder, as part of a workspace. On the other hand, the `resource` scoped configuration setting is able to be overridden everywhere, in any scenario.\r\n\r\nShould we have different names for these scopes? Should the description be different, and address the limitation of the `workbench` scope in contrast to the `resource` scope?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31541/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31540","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31540/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31540/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31540/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31540","id":245980056,"number":31540,"title":"Open
