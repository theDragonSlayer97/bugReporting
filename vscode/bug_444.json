This could help people with more than one account (personal & work) to well manage the author in the commits.\r\n\r\n## Problem:\r\nPeople using work laptops are likely to have their global email configured to work email. They might use full blown Visual Studio IDE for work but VS Code for personal projects. But, when using VS Code for personal projects on the same machine commits always take the work email. There's currently no way to customize the username / email used in commits made from VS Code.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution:\r\nWe can configure the username / email for a specific repository (Workspace Settings) or for entire VS Code (User Settings).\r\n\r\nThe configuration could be something like\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"git.username\": \"Rohith Kumbharkar\",\r\n\"git.email\": \"rohithkumbharkar@users.noreply.github.com\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe order of preference would be\r\n\r\n1. Workspace settings\r\n2. User settings\r\n3. git globals\r\n\r\nBefore making a commit, VS Code will look for **git.username** & **git.email** in Workspace then User settings.\r\n\r\nIf the values are not found in both Workspace & User settings then it reverts back to default behavior of fetching from git global config.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22470","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22470/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22470/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22470/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22470","id":213588113,"number":22470,"title":"Possible feature request: Edit parts of a file as if they are separate files accessible by tabs.","user":{"login":"jdc-cunningham","id":11015467,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11015467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdc-cunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jdc-cunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdc-cunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdc-cunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdc-cunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdc-cunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdc-cunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdc-cunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdc-cunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdc-cunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdc-cunningham/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":9,"created_at":"2017-03-12T07:24:35Z","updated_at":"2017-09-03T09:27:37Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"edit: if this already exists, could you please tell me what the setting is called.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there is a reason this is not in practice/common place.\r\n\r\nSay it was a JavaScript file and you had three functions, function one(), function two(), function three()...\r\n\r\nIf you had three separate files open, you'd have three tabs that you can click on and switch between the files.\r\n\r\nIf you had a pretty complex JavaScript file and wanted to 'chunk it' and modify it as if it was made of multiple individual files, while keeping it as one...
