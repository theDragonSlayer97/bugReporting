the sake of simplify I would like start a discussion about folding `ShellTask` and `ProcessTask`. The following things confuse me:\r\n\r\n* A `TaskProvider` must return a `Task` but I cannot instantiate a `Task` and I have to know that a Task is an or-type\r\n* Shell and process task have 7 identical properties and only differ in `process` vs `commandLine` and in `options`, which again have quite some overlap\r\n* My understanding is that a ShellTask should also be able to execute a process\r\n* Does a ShellTask run in the terminal and does a process task \"run\" in an output channel or both run in a terminal? \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27586","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27586/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27586/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27586/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27586","id":232273278,"number":27586,"title":"Vertical scroll in vscode not work properly after the suspension .
