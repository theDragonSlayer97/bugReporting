The last line will be indented two spaces to match (presumably) the code that was pasted. This is a simple example, there are lots of other broken cases.

A not too small project is needed - it has to be possible to scroll the files in the Explorer view.\r\n2. I could only reproduce it if two editors are opened side by side and enough files are opened already that the file tabs at each side do not fit in the row.\r\n3. (Double) click different files in the Explorer view.

VSCode extensions come with their own set of keyboard shortcuts which usually do not conflict with those shipped as default with VSCode.\r\n\r\nHowever, with multiple extensions installed it often happens that two or more of them register the same keyboard shortcut and since there is currently no system in place to prevent that (at least not to my knowledge) the only way to find out that there is a conflict is by actually using a shortcut and realizing it doesn't do what it's supposed to do.\r\n\r\nI think that this feature is essential for a tool that relies so heavily on using shortcuts.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: Just to be clear, I am aware of the _\"Show conflicts\"_ option in the right-click context menu but it basically just does a search for a specific keyboard shortcut (the one that has been right-clicked on).\r\n\r\nWhat I am talking about is a feature that would, for example, color all duplicate entries in _Keyboard shortcuts_ dialog red or at least warn if an extension is trying to register a shortcut that has already been declared.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33744","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33744/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33744/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33744/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33744","id":254873707,"number":33744,"title":"Python
