Suppose I am using my library like this:\n\n```\nvar Lib = require(\"lib\");\nvar Book = require(\"book\");\nvar lib = new Lib();\nlib.add(new Book(\"a\"));\nlib.on(\"event\", function(\"I take\", \"only 2 arguments\");\nvar book = lib.getFirstBook();\nbook.changeAuthor(\"I am an author\");\n```\n\nI have tried many things, but typedefintion allows function which I haven't defined like `lib.shouldNotExit()` without showing any error (In Visual Studio Code). Also, do I need to require typedefinition file `book.d.ts`, as  I have added it in `d.ts`reference path in `lib`'s `d.ts` file.\n\nMaybe because I have skipped `Typescript` I am struggling so much. But I only want to write `TypeDefinition` and not `Typescript`. I couldn't find any good resource for writing `d.ts` file on net. If anyone can point me to one it would be great. \n\n---\n\nI tried this\n\n```\nrequire(\"http\").shouldNotExist();\n```\n\nI was expecting some warning, but none was shown. Do I need to set some strict flag for it to show warning?\n\n---\n\nI also tried this\n\n```\ndeclare module \"library\" {\n    class Library {\n        constructor();\n        book: string;\n    }\n    export = Library;\n}\n```\n\nBut VSCode now treats `new Library()` as `any`. The workaround I found was using `export class Library {...}` instead of `export = Library`, but clearly this requires change in the source files itself, as it suggests a usage like this `new require(\"library\").Library()`. Is there no way I can achieve the export of a class itself, which VSCode can recognize?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/360","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/360/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/360/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/360/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/360","id":118070325,"number":360,"title":"Issue
