fellow student of mine switched to VS Code after having used Atom. He didn't know Emmet exists, so he wasn't familiar with expansion on tab, he expected 4 spaces to be inserted. After his frustration, I guided him in the settings to turn of Emmet.\r\n\r\nA solution I am thinking of would be to ask the user if he or she would like to use Emmet the first time a Emmet compatible file is opened. To give a user more context on what Emmet is, it could be useful to show build in extension in the extension view. The message could have a button which opens the Emmet extension page.\r\nAn extension page also solves a second concern. In my experience, for a new user it is weird turning self installed extensions off through the extension view and build in extensions trough settings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Normal Emmet expansion on tab in an html or php file","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27877","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27877/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27877/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27877/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27877","id":232973360,"number":27877,"title":"No

Create a markdown document and use inline LaTeX (e.g. `$a_{b}$`) for math.\r\n2. VSCode interprets the markdown underscore to mean italic text -- instead of math subscript -- and will make the markdown text italic until it sees a matching underscore delimiter.\r\n\r\nI think this is behavior is theme dependent, but I'm not sure. Changing themes just changes how the text between the underscores is rendered (italic or colored or whatever). I believe that markdown delimiters (`_` and `*`) in math mode should be ignored the way they are in code blocks.\r\n\r\n![markdown_latex](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5393995/26690428/1ca09656-46ae-11e7-97f9-b3231b6ad09d.png)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4288","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"BA9E:429A:81F70D:15D02A2:59D935C5","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=265>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=263>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"5e824f557ed127ed29f3542a16707a27\"","status":"200 OK"}}
