45.0.2454.85\n  Node 4.1.1\n- **OS Version**: Windows 7\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Verify there are no instances of VSCode running via Process Explorer\n2. Run VSCode Insiders\n3. Either wait for it to automatically notify about new version or manually check\n4. Select \"Update Now\" and VSCode closes and the installer starts\n5. During the install I get the following message:\n\n```\nError\nSetup was unable to automatically close all applications. It is recommended that you close all applications using files that need to be updated by Setup before continuing.\n\nClick Retry to try again, Ignore to proceed anyway, or Abort to cancel installation.\nAbort   Retry   Ignore  \n```\n\nNone of the buttons will allow the install to continue. I checked Process Explorer and there are no instances of VSCode running. The only processes are:\n- CodeSetup-18ebb4a4f5491af7b16e91e42fc36410bbb2e4d7.exe at C:\\Users<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\vscode-update\\CodeSetup-18ebb4a4f5491af7b16e91e42fc36410bbb2e4d7.exe\n

happened during the last Insiders update and the only way I was able to update was to uninstall and install the updated setup.\n\nAny ideas on what's going on?\n\nThanks,\nDerek\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4358","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4358/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4358/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4358/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4358","id":141565576,"number":4358,"title":"Output

was almost convinced this was simply and issue in Edge causing problems, vs the editor. \nBecause for instance, in many multi-line text editors (like this one), sometimes when trying to navigate up
