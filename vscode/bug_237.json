Except for VSCode littering my files with it's unnecessary and unused, empty symbols.json files.

But for the later it is an awesome tool as well!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open any arbitrary directory in VSCode\r\n2. VSCode creates an empty symbols.json in a .vscode subdirectory\r\n3. Close VSCode when done editing\r\n4.

Install Node fresh at version `8.1.1` (either through `nvm` or on a new machine. Both fail for me)\r\n2. Verify that `npm` was installed at version `5.0.3`\r\n3. As per the VS Code build instructions, run `./scripts/npm.sh install`\r\n4. The install should fail\r\n5. As found in the Windows instructions, install `npm` at version `3.10.8` via the following command:\r\n  `npm install -g npm@3.10.8`\r\n6. Re-run `./scripts/npm.sh install` successfully\r\n\r\nRecommended course of action: \r\n1. lock the version of `npm` down in the README.md. \r\n2. Add explicit instructions to install and use `nvm`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively do both 1&2 above, and additionally increase the required version of `npm` to something higher than `3.10.8` as well as raise the version of `lockfile` and any other necessary dependencies.\r\n\r\n(I personally recommend the minimal route of enforcing an `npm` version)\r\n\r\nI'll probably make a PR for this myself, but I
