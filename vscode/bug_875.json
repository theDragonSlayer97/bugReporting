VSCode Version: 1.3.1\n\nIn the `settings.json` you can configure the path for `typescript.tsdk`.\nYou _can_ use an absolute path which _always_ finds a TypeScript language server (at least if it is available), but you can't have different versions of TypeScript for different projects.\nYou _can_ use a relative path (like `node_modules/typescript/lib`) which allows you to use different versions of TypeScript for different projects, but it _can't_ find a TypeScript language server, if `node_modules/typescript/lib` isn't in your root (e.g. if you use multi-package repositories or multiple independent examples in one repository).\n\nIt would be nice, if vscode could just try to `require` `typescript/lib` relative to the current opened TypeScript file which would probably be the most natural way.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9514","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9514/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9514/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9514/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9514","id":166480726,"number":9514,"title":"Command
