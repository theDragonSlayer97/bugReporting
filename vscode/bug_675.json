Other subcommands could be supported the same way, for some the completion item might tell you what it does (like when creating a branch), for others it's fine if it doesn't.\r\n\r\nI like how it supports creating a new branch by assuming an unknown name after `git checkout` is a branch to be created. That could be kept almost the same, except the completion item would tell you that it will insert the `-b` option for you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15533","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15533/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15533/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15533/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15533","id":189507544,"number":15533,"title":"Create a \"TypeHierarchyProvider\" api for visualising type hierarchies","user":{"login":"DanTup","id":1078012,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1078012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup","html_url":"https://github.com/DanTup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":290465400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/api","name":"api","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-11-15T21:10:31Z","updated_at":"2016-11-16T08:29:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"(Split from #15485)\r\n\r\nDart Code has had requests for viewing/navigating [type hierarchies](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/133).
