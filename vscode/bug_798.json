VSCode Version: 1.5.1\n- OS Version: Windows 7 x64\n\nI am working on an extension that will inject some text into your document at the current cursor (or all cursors if there are multiple). I'm seeing some weird behavior with the cursor after inserting the text.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Type some random sentence of text.\n2. Place your cursor somewhere mid sentence.\n3. Run an extension that inserts \"HELLO WORLD\" at your cursor position:\n\n```\nlet textEditor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;\n// Get the active text document's uri\nlet uri = textEditor.document.uri;\n\n// Create a new TextEdit for each selection\nlet edits = [];\nfor (let selection of textEditor.selections) {\n  edits.push(vscode.TextEdit.insert(selection.active, \"HELLO WORLD\");\n}\n\n// New WorkspaceEdit\nlet edit = new vscode.WorkspaceEdit();\n\n// Add the TextEdit's to your WorkspaceEdit\nedit.set(uri, edits);\n\n// Applying the WorkspaceEdit\nvscode.workspace.applyEdit(edit);\n```\n1. You will see your sentence with \"HELLO WORLD\" inserted into the middle of it. Your cursor will be immediately following the D in HELLO WORLD.\n2. Press LEFT on your keyboard, your cursor will jump to the beginning of HELLO WORLD, before the H.\n\nThat seems like weird behavior right? I would expect the cursor to move one space to the left, but instead of jumped to the beginning of the inserted text, where your cursor was before inserting the text.

behavior?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11841/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11840","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11840/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11840/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11840/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11840","id":176219275,"number":11840,"title":"Dislike

Expand directories in the right hand side page, noticed how the files seem to be indented too much of the left hand side.\n\nScreenshot of Error:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1080928/18411690/6225cbe2-7774-11e6-945d-664f8d5f9d09.png)\n\nScreenshot from Windows for comparison:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1080928/18411696/7ada988e-7774-11e6-9069-025b88d3dcea.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11830","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11830/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11830/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11830/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11830","id":176182429,"number":11830,"title":"Column mode selection behavior is inconsistent with user expectations","user":{"login":"nholthaus","id":10323743,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10323743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nholthaus","html_url":"https://github.com/nholthaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nholthaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nholthaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nholthaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nholthaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nholthaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nholthaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nholthaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nholthaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nholthaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-09-10T14:29:51Z","updated_at":"2016-09-11T16:28:42Z","closed_at":"2016-09-11T16:28:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.5.1\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04, Windows 7/10, probably all others\n\nMost programs with column mode (visual studio/notepad++/kdevelop/etc) have the following user experience:\n1. hold the keyboard shortcut/toggle column mode.\n2. click somewhere. This is the selection 'start' anchor.\n3. drag somewhere. This is the selection 'end' anchor.\n\nHowever, in visual studio code, the process is:\n1. click somewhere. This is the selection 'start' anchor.\n2. hold the keyboard shortcut/toggle column mode\n3. drag somewhere. This is the selection 'end' anchor.\n\nIMHO this is unintuitive for two reasons:\n1. It goes against all the training we have from other dev tools we've been using much longer.\n2. Usually, I don't think about where I _left_ my cursor when I decide to do an operation. I'm thinking about what I _want_ to do. I find that whenever I use code's column mode, I'm always unpleasantly surprised to find that the cursor is not where I expect it and isn't updated to my click.\n\nAdditionally, while it's technically the same number of steps, method 1 is much more fluid as the holding/clicking/dragging can be done in a smooth motion, rather than having to position the cursor as a distinct and thoughtful first step.\n\nCould you please change the cursor selection to method 2?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11829","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11829/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11829/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11829/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11829","id":176178916,"number":11829,"title":"`ESC` key no longer closes the output window","user":{"login":"db666","id":1255606,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1255606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/db666","html_url":"https://github.com/db666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/db666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/db666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/db666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/db666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/db666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/db666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/db666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/db666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/db666/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-10T13:11:12Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T13:12:44Z","closed_at":"2016-09-19T13:12:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.5.1 (07d663dc1bd848161edf4cd4ce30cce410d3d877, 2016-09-08T21:33:49.307Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.10586\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

Have a source editor with some file (tried with js, css) and the internal terminal open\n2. Start selecting a text block with track pad, tap and start dragging selection\n3. While selecting move pointer above terminal window\n4. Finish selecting text by pulling up finger from track pad - make sure you are above terminal window\n\nExpected:\nText is selected and source editor in focus, so next key press will overwrite selection\n\nActual:\nText is selected but internal terminal window is in focus, so next key press will not overwrite selection, but will input a character in terminal.\n\nNote: When the same steps tried with explorer window instead of terminal, it works as expected.
