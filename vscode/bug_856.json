Basic Information\n- VSCode Version: 1.3.1\n- OS Version: OSX (if required I can try to reproduce on Windows)\n## Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Open markdown file\n2. Create list doesn't matter whether it is 1 or more levels.\n3. Add a code block inline\n\n_**Two Examples Follow**_\n## Example 1:\n\nfrom this [gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/clintel/1155906/raw/6b2a78696ff6b0b7222691c52fd0f3c6b98e3172/gistfile1.md)\n\n`````` typescript\n1. This is a numbered list.\n2. I'm going to include a fenced code block as part of this bullet:\n\n    ```\n    Code\n    More Code\n    ```\n\n3. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.\n   1. Like this:\n\n        ```c\n        printf(\"Hello, World!\");\n        ```\n\n   2. The key is to indent your fenced block by **(4 * bullet_indent_level)** spaces.\n   3. Also need to put a separating newline above and below the fenced block.\n``````\n## Example 2\n\nBest Practices\n- Start from the Project's Documentation, not their Source if possible\n- Use _Namespaces_ for;\n      - variable types\n      - parameters\n- Callbacks - (_functions as parameters_) - When writing the function signatures for these types, do not mark those parameters as optional. The right way to think of this is “What parameters will be provided?”, not “What parameters will be consumed?”.\n- Extensible Declarations - using namespaces you can have a variable named the same in the current namespace, but with additional parameters...\n  - [Declarations Merging](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html) for more details\n    \n    ``` typescript\n    interface SomePoint { x: number; y: number; }\n    declare var MyPoint: SomePoint;\n    \n    interface SomePoint { z: number; }\n    MyPoint.z = 4; // OK\n    ```\n- xxx\n## Output (attached):\n\n![screen shot 2016-08-03 at 8 51 25 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5379325/17372176/874800d8-5957-11e6-99ec-7955f47c5f23.png)\n\n_As you can see the output is colorized perfectly fine, it is the editor side that is lacking_\n\nHowever, it is only present within lists, as soon as I remove the indentations, the colorization within the editor returns.... see:\n## Output (attached):\n\n![screen shot 2016-08-03 at 8 52 41 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5379325/17372207/abd0e064-5957-11e6-9f64-6778150b3a8a.png)\n## Further information\n- This does not seem to be the same issue as #9457 - as multiline blocks work when non-indented, and single blocks never work when indented.\n- This issue occurs whether I am using tabs or spaces.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10081","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10081/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10081/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10081/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/10081","id":169163386,"number":10081,"title":"refine
