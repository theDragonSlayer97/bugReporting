is somewhat unexpected and leads to the view lines being rendered before the view zone is inserted, then the view lines emit a scroll change due to a max line width update, and at that time the find widget decides to insert a view zone.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n* have tow short files\r\n* try to disable lazy features that would cause editor repaints\r\n* open find&replace\r\n* switch to a different file\r\n\r\nThe find widget ends up inserting a view zone while the view is rendering. I think it has to do with how the editor is empty, then it has lines, then the max line width is updated, which causes a scrollWidth update in the scroll state, which eventually causes the find widget

The diff should open with the tab tile: \"filename (Working Tree)\", do not modify any contents or double click on tab\r\n5. Open another file\r\n6. Verify tab in step 4 is still open\r\n\r\nI will do this for each of the files I have changed and thinking of committing to review my changes before I stage them. I believe the behavior is the same for staged files. This adds many tabs that I really don't need open when I go from one diff to another. I would like the tab to be closed/replaced by a preview. I would think the diff tab would be like any other file tab; therefore if I opened a diff, then opened a file or another diff by single clicking, the diff would be replaced by the new file's preview.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27139","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27139/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27139/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27139/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27139","id":230709694,"number":27139,"title":"Environment

After relaunching VSCode or opening a new window, the value is set again - it is recognized within the code and shows up in `printenv`within the built-in terminal, but it is not listed in regular Terminal or iTerm, so I guess it is set only for each new window/instance.\r\n\r\nWhat's even more annoying is that this key is expired and it replaces my working key during local development, making it impossible to ignore.\r\nBTW googling it shows that this key is quite \"popular\" on the web :)\r\n\r\nI think that [**this**](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/common/google_api_key.h#L14) may be the culprit, but don't know the codebase that well to fix it on my own.
