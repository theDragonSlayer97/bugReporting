Select continue without a scanning the output: Ensure that the tasks executes and no problems are detected.\r\n- Task > Run Build Task: shows the list again with the task run last listed under recently used tasks. This time select a problem matcher: Enusre that problems are detected (2) and that the tasks.json file opens with a configuration like this:\r\n```ts\r\n{\r\n\t// See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\r\n\t// for the documentation about the tasks.json format\r\n\t\"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n\t\"tasks\": [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"gulp\",\r\n\t\t\t\"task\": \"build\",\r\n\t\t\t\"problemMatcher\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t\"$tsc\"\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- delete the tasks section in the tasks.json file. Run the steps again. Ensure that the tasks section get updated again and that the comment in the file is preserved.\r\n- Task > Run Task. Press the gear icon to the right of the gulp: watch task. Ensure that a corresponding configuration section is inserted into the tasks.json and that the problem matcher is set to an empty array.\r\n- add a label property to one of the tasks. Ensure that it is reflected in the task's quick pick\r\n- tweak also the presentation options of a task. Ensure that reveal, echo and focus work as expected\r\n- tweak also the panel property of the presentation property. This should change the behavior as follows:\r\n  - `new`: every execution of the task creates a new panel. \r\n  - `dedicated`: there is one panel for the task. Every execution uses the same panel and the panel is not reused with other tasks.\r\n  - `shared`: the panel is shared with other tasks that are marked as shared.\r\n- tweak the primary build task: open the tasks.json. Add the following to the `gulp build` task: `\"group\": { \"kind\": \"build\", \"isPrimary\": true }`. Execute Task > Run Build Task... This should execute the gulp build task without showing the quick pick.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29441","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29441/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29441/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29441/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29441","id":238507743,"number":29441,"title":"Touchpad

10, Build 15036\r\n\r\nVersion 1.14.0-insider\r\nCommit 779a7dfa682e31d870680caea572a11d009ab447\r\nDate 2017-06-23T05:59:57.891Z\r\nShell 1.6.6\r\nRenderer 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode 7.4.0\r\n\r\nSomething weird happens for me for quite some time now. It is that after certain output, all text starts to be bold in the integrated terminal, usually until some process is closed or in case of SSH until the session is closed. But it still may have some kind of \"buggy state\" afterwards, see below.\r\n\r\n### Test case 1\r\n\r\n1. Run **WSL bash** in integrated terminal\r\n2. Open node (v8.0.0) REPL\r\n3. Enter `12345` and press Enter. Everything is still okay, nothing is bold.\r\n4. Enter `null` and press Enter. Note that the output word `null` is bold.\r\n5. Enter `12345` and press Enter. Note that what you enter is now also bold (but the yellow text is not).\r\n6. Exit by pressing Ctrl+C twice. Note that the output about having to press Ctrl+C twice is also bold.\r\n7. Repeat the above steps 2-6 once more. Note that the problem has been resolved by quitting node, it will again work normally until step 4 is reached.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6010463/27534581-c62c8ed8-5a67-11e7-865f-84c14445bf58.png)\r\n\r\n### Test case 2\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this case behaves *slightly* different from test case 1 and shows that there is some kind of state which is not fully reset when existing the process which caused the bold text in the first place.\r\n\r\n1. Run **Git bash** in integrated terminal.\r\n2. *Same as above:* Open node (v8.0.0) REPL\r\n3. *Same as above:* Enter `12345` and press Enter. Everything is still okay, nothing is bold.\r\n4. *Same as above:* Enter `null` and press Enter. Note that the output word `null` is bold.\r\n5. *Same as above:* Enter `12345` and press Enter. Note that what you enter is now also bold (but the yellow text is not).\r\n6. *Same as above:* Exit by pressing Ctrl+C twice. Note that the output about having to press Ctrl+C twice is also bold.\r\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 once more. You will notice that, unlike in test case 1, there is a subtle difference in the second iteration: In step 4, when you start typing `null`, **the text you type is already bold**.

I've attached some files I drew up of the new icon. One is actually a PNG the other is a .ico file disguised as a PNG because GitHub doesn't allow for the uploading of ICO files. Just change the extension and it should be fine. \r\n![vs icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29654835/27530003-e78876b8-5a13-11e7-8863-83fbdb900f72.png)\r\n![vs icon - ico
