In other words, I press the physical Esc key to enable caps lock (very rare) and the physical Caps Lock for escape (very common). This used to work fine in VS Code 1.8.1 but misbehaves in 1.14.2. VS Code is the only software I have used that does this.\r\n\r\nSwapping Esc and Caps Lock is common among Vim users, who frequently use the Esc key. See e.g. http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Map_caps_lock_to_escape_in_XWindows.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Make a file swap_escape with the following content:\r\n```\r\nremove Lock = Caps_Lock  \r\nkeysym Escape = Caps_Lock\r\nkeysym Caps_Lock = Escape\r\nadd Lock = Caps_Lock\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Use xmodmap to remap the keys\r\n```\r\nxmodmap swap_escape\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Caps Lock should now perform the function typically assigned to Esc, and vice versa.\r\n\r\n4. Select some text in VS Code. Press the Caps Lock key. Expected: text is unselected (because the key means escape to the OS). Observed: nothing happens.\r\n\r\n5. Select some text in VS Code. Press the Esc key. Expected: selection remains, caps lock is enabled in the OS. Observed: Text is unselected _and_ caps lock is enabled in the OS.\r\n\r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32037/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32036","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32036/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32036/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32036/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32036","id":248086019,"number":32036,"title":"Syntax Highlighting For PHP Broken When Using Trait Classes","user":{"login":"M-Porter","id":2313263,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2313263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/M-Porter","html_url":"https://github.com/M-Porter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M-Porter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M-Porter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M-Porter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M-Porter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M-Porter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M-Porter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M-Porter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M-Porter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M-Porter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":293382067,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/php","name":"php","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-08-04T18:42:33Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T18:53:24Z","closed_at":"2017-08-04T18:45:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.14.2 (cb82febafda0c8c199b9201ad274e25d9a76874e, 2017-07-19T23:22:50.650Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 15.6.0\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\nExtension|Author (truncated)|Version\r\n---|---|---\r\nerb|Cra|0.0.1\r\nEditorConfig|Edi|0.9.4\r\nlaravel-blade|KTa|0.0.1\r\nejs-language-support|Qas|0.0.1\r\nActiveFileInStatusBar|Ros|1.0.2\r\njsx|Twe|0.0.1\r\nsort-lines|Tyr|1.3.0\r\nscratchpad|awe|0.1.0\r\ngotemplate|cas|0.1.1\r\ncode-wsync|mpo|0.0.1\r\nvscode-eslint|dba|1.2.11\r\npython|don|0.7.0\r\nprettier-vscode|esb|0.22.1\r\nphp-debug|fel|1.11.1\r\ndocthis|joe|0.4.7\r\nphp-symbols|lin|2.1.0\r\nGo|luk|0.6.63\r\nprettify-json|moh|0.0.3\r\natom-keybindings|ms-|3.0.1\r\nphp-docblocker|nei|1.2.0\r\nvetur|oct|0.9.3\r\nRuby|reb|0.13.0\r\nvscode-icons|rob|7.12.0\r\nstylelint|shi|0.28.0\r\nsimple-ruby-erb|vor|0.2.1\r\ntwig|wha|1.0.2\r\njinja|who|0.0.8\r\n\r\n(2 theme extensions excluded)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

Using Vue.js CLI, create a new project\r\n2. Open project with VSCode\r\n3. Open integrated terminal\r\n4. execute command:  npm run dev  (this will start up the auto reload feature of the Vue.js CLI and will launch the browser.)\r\n5. Use the extensions tab and reload an extension or close VSCode.\r\n\r\nEasy to follow steps for creating project and launching are here:  [https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html)\r\n\r\n**Expected**:  VSCode would gracefully terminate the process running in the integrated command terminal. \r\n\r\n**Actual:** VSCode closes, but leaves the process started by the now closed integrated terminal running.  The only way to terminate the process is to use task manager.  This issue is very difficult to figure out the first time it happens.  In my case, I reloaded VSCode after starting up a terminal process.  When VSCode reopened, I tried re-running:  npm run dev.  I got a bizarre error about having the wrong version of Node.js installed on my machine.  An hour later I figured out what happened, but it was painful.\r\n\r\nPlease add a feature for VSCode to gracefully terminate any integrated terminal processes before it closes or reloads.\r\n\r\nThank you!!\r\n\r\nKarl Shifflett\r\nMicrosoft MVP.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions:

For example, if the snippet has the format `\"a\\\\b\"` with `n` backslashes the outputs for various `n` are as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2  -> a\\b\r\n4  -> a\\b\r\n6  -> a\\\\b\r\n8  -> a\\\\b\r\n10 -> a\\\\\\b\r\n12 -> a\\\\\\b\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that the output for 2 backslashes is identical to the output with 4 backslashes suggests that something is off here.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
