VSCode Version: Insiders\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nRegarding test item #12100 \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. This may not be a problem and might just be me.  Open a large .cshtml file (try the one I link to below) and select everything.\n2. Press Shift + Tab several times to collapse all the hierarchy and mess up its formatting.\n3. Now Format the file\n4. Notice that the file formats weird as pictured below (maybe it's just [my file](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-website/blob/3cfa8213681f680418997c7671fa1b8c452ac2af/website/Views/Docs/extensions/example-word-count.cshtml)).\n\n**Original file before I used Shift+Tab several times**\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-09-28 at 11 09 18 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11839736/18942905/1500a31c-85d1-11e6-9961-b795550bca44.png\">\n\n**After format**\nWhat's with the white space in the middle of the code?  Maybe this file uses spaces, maybe it has mixed tabs and spaces and this had something to do with it?\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-09-28 at 11 08 44 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11839736/18942911/24d53794-85d1-11e6-8fbd-c8c84524cf5b.png\">\n\nNotice how some of the tags that are nested are all linline still.

pack\n3. update the extension pack from VSCode\n\nExpected: prompt asking if I also want dependencies to be installed\nActual: no prompt, which seems inconsistent with the rest of the experience\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12958","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12958/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12958/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12958/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12958","id":179922567,"number":12958,"title":"Extension

Restarting VSCode and waiting did nothing either.\n\nEventually, I searched the marketplace for that extension, and it popped up into the list, with the appropriate Update / Uninstall buttons, which in turn prompted the outdated list to be updated (extension appears in `@outdated` query)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4602","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"D704:429A:854E9D:166852C:59D940BE","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=761>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=759>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"077a43010b261cf457c5dc55d3c2d7bd\"","status":"200 OK"}}
