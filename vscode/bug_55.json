It makes perfect sense to me that people don't want to see a lightbulb when there is nothing bad in the code. But the current change of behaviour is not an optimal solution in my opinion. I'd love to see the lightbulb appearing on empty selections. That way the user can see there are quickfixes for his code even before the linter started to mark the current identifier. \r\nIn my specific case there is no fast linter that is capable of marking unknown identifiers in real time but the language service can say quickly when an identifier can't be resolved as long as source file ABC is not imported. So I made use of the empty selection lightbulb which appears while typing an unknown identifier name. The user got immediate feedback about the quick fix. With the changes in 1.16 the user has to check for quick fixes by hand which declines the user experience.\r\n\r\nSince the lightbulb annoyed users in other situations I'd love to see an API where each code action comes with a code action kind like `refactoring` or `fix` and VSCode would show the lightbulb for fixes only while refactorings are offered somewhere else.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34171","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34171/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34171/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34171/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/34171","id":256846311,"number":34171,"title":"Use

`TreeDataProvider.getChildren` supports returning a promise for async filling of a node, but in some cases (in GitLens for example) providing all children of a node could be very costly (in terms of both time and usability). It would be great if there was a built-in way to provide some form of paging/streaming of children (i.e. infinite scrolling). Or at least maybe some way where a `TreeItem` could be marked as \"inline expanding\" -- meaning when you click on that item it would be removed and replaced with its children? (Could maybe even have it as `TreeItemCollapsibleState.InlineExpand` or something?).\r\n\r\nPersonally I like the idea of being able to have an \"inline expanding\" node -- i.e. a *more* from both a usability and perf view point -- because while infinite scroll is nice in some cases, in a tree it doesn't seem ideal, as you end up having to keep scrolling past stuff you may or may not care about to get to a further down item in another \"branch\".\r\n\r\nIf there is already some mechanism to handle this I'm all 👂 as well 😄. As I'm struggling with this a bit in the new GitLens custom view, where I show the history of a branch and I don't want to show the entire history all at once (because of the time involved). I've implemented a custom paging solution for use in the quick picks, but so far I haven't found a solution I like (ux wise) in the custom views.\r\n\r\n@sandy081 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34151/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4497","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"B733:3670:A2F049:1A3E035:59D931FE","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=56>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=54>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d60c6e7e8dd229180bafe6a1e26f13ed\"","status":"200 OK"}}
