VSCode Version:1.0\n- OS Version: Linux\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nIn my extension I have a completionItemProvider that is registered like that:\n\n``` typescript\n    let jsonDocumentFilter = [{ language: 'json', pattern: '**∕bower.json' }];\n    context.subscriptions.push(languages.registerCompletionItemProvider(jsonDocumentFilter, new JSONCompletionItemProvider(), '.', '$'));\n```\n\nThe LanguageFeatureRegistry uses base/common/glob.ts: `glob.match(filter.pattern, uri.fsPath)`\n\n `globToRegExp` creates the following regex for this:  `^[^/\\\\]*?[^/\\\\]*?∕bower\\.json$` which doesn't match a path like \"/home/abc/workspaces/samples/languages/json/bower.json\"\n\nFrom debugging it seems the bug is in `splitGlobAware`:\n\n``` typescript\n        for (var i = 0; i < pattern.length; i++) {\n            char = pattern[i];\n            switch (char) {\n                case splitChar:\n                    if (!inBraces && !inBrackets) {\n

Unix editors (emacs, vim etc) use a mix of tabs and spaces for indentation. The tab length is always assumed to be 8 and if the indentation size is different, indentation is created by  inserting as much tabs as possible and inserting spaces for the remainder. Right now, in order to view such files correctly one needs to set the tab size to 8, convert the file to use only spaces and then set the indentation size to the correct value. However, when working on legacy code it is desired to keep the indentation method the same to avoid unnecessary commits. Therefore VSCode should support this method of indentation, auto detect it and allow to easily convert from and to it.\n- VSCode Version: 1.0.0\n- OS Version: OS X 10.11.4\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
