find it a bit crazy to refresh the entire tree every time there is any event on the stacks model. For example you get an event when the active group changes but that is not a structural change that does not require any tree updates. The same is true for an editor that turns dirty or is saved.\n\nAs much as the current approach is dead simple, I think we can prevent unnecessary work by looking at the event and then deciding what to do.\n\nMaybe if it would help, I could add a flag to the aggregated event that would indicate if the change is structural or not?\n\nStill, you would have to solve the issue independently for an editor turning dirty or not because there you have at least a slight UI change.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6669","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6669/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6669/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6669/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6669","id":156292373,"number":6669,"title":"Show

the VS Code debugger. Oddly enough VS Code's _code injection_ fixes the failing stacktrace request for yet unknown reasons.\n\nUntil VS Code 1.1.1 code injection was only working for a debug session of type 'launch'. As a consequence node v6 debugging would fail in debug sessions of type 'attach'. In the May milestone we've fixed code injection for 'attach' mode which makes node v6 debugging work in VS Code 1.2 in 'attach' mode. \n\nVerify that you can attach to and debug an express application:\n- install node v6\n- from command line \n  - run `npm install -g express-generator`\n  - generate express application with `express myExpressApp`\n  - run `cd myExpressApp`\n  - run `npm install`\n  - run `node --debug bin\\www`\n- open `myExpressApp` with VS Code and attach to the node process\n- set break point to `index.js:line:6`\n- and navigate in a web browser to 'http://localhost:3000/'\n\nVerify that the call stack view shows the stack trace correctly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6658","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6658/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6658/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6658/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6658","id":156234819,"number":6658,"title":"Test slow variables and call stack improvements","user":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/17","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/17","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/17/labels","id":1716950,"number":17,"title":"May 2016","description":"","creator":{"login":"dbaeumer","id":1931590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1931590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaeumer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaeumer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":302,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-04-19T13:15:12Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T08:29:02Z","due_on":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-05-31T08:25:06Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-05-23T09:17:46Z","updated_at":"2016-05-24T09:59:56Z","closed_at":"2016-05-24T09:59:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Test for #5645:\n- [x] Windows | OS X | Linux - **@isidorn**\n\nFor improving the stepping experience for programs with lots of local variables, we've made the following adjustments:\n- if a scope has more than 100 local variables, VS Code no longer auto expands that scope\n- after the user has expanded the scope only the first 100 local variables are shown.\n- in both cases the name of the scope reflects the fact that there many locals and only a subset is shown.\n\nVerify that the following use case from the TypeScript transpiler works smoother:\n1. git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript.git\n2. npm install, npm install jake\n3. jake local\n4. set breakpoint in checker.ts:47\n5.
