Both these actions are 'heavy', opening preview and opening a terminal outside of vscode\n3. While I tested the copy / paste feature I accidently triggered the other actions multiple times and this led to a very frustrating experience\n\nMy suggestions is that these actions should be disabled when terminal is visible. Not when terminal has focus, imho that is the biggest flow of the current approach. If these actions were enabled when terminal is visible they could also be exectued from the command palette (my concers around this are raised in other bugs).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9763/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9762","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9762/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9762/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9762/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9762","id":167564040,"number":9762,"title":"[tab
