That is a big difference as people won't see it if they don't scroll down the page.\r\n\r\nJust like SEO,\r\n\r\n> the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users\r\n\r\nThe first extension in the results page has 110k downloads. But IMHO, it's because the positive feedback loop (I don't judge whether the extension itself is good or not). Being the first one receives many downloads, and then the huge download count keep it ranked first.\r\n\r\nMy friend once asked me why vscode can only preview Markdown in browser. I felt really confused why he asked that. And then he told me he just searched the markdown extension and found the first one had been downloaded so many times. So, he downloaded that extension and came to the question above (the only feature in a previous version of that extension).\r\n\r\nAs I know, Markdown preview is a out-of-box feature even in the earliest version of vscode.\r\n\r\nSo, I think the current sorting results are not good. It's said to be sorted by relevance, but I'm confused why some extensions are more 'relevant' than mine.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBTW, for language extensions, it would be better to have a officially recommended (not necessary officially maintained) extension for each language.\r\nOn the one hand, it's a good experience for users (no need to try and choose one from many similar extensions).\r\nOn the other hand, it can save the effort of extension authors to have one extension to contribute to.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27172","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27172/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27172/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27172/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27172","id":230903097,"number":27172,"title":"Problem with extension using sqlite3","user":{"login":"raaffaaeell","id":6959662,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6959662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raaffaaeell","html_url":"https://github.com/raaffaaeell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raaffaaeell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raaffaaeell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raaffaaeell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raaffaaeell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raaffaaeell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raaffaaeell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raaffaaeell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raaffaaeell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raaffaaeell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2017-05-24T02:31:14Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T01:54:34Z","closed_at":"2017-05-24T19:43:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

develop in Typescript and we resolve the current file name using `${fileBasenameNoExtension}`, Given we have both a \"api\" package and a \"orm\" package in a git mono repo,\r\nWe are stuck doing this

It would be great if properties in the associated configuration can be passed to preLaunchTask.\r\n\r\nScenario: \r\n  I am writing a pre-launch task to automate remote node.js debugging. The pre-launch task will launch the node.js process remotely and establish a SSH tunnel (port forwarding) back to local computer. And then debugger connects to that forwarded port to start debugging. \r\n  The node.js debugger port is specified in launch.json file, and there is no good way for the pre-launch task to get the debugger port. \r\n\r\nThe problem can be solved if preLaunchTask can take parameters from the configuration. For example, tasks.json allow '$config.port' as args:\r\n\r\n           {\r\n                \"command\": \"dotnet\",\r\n                \"taskName\": \"prepareDebug\",\r\n                \"suppressTaskName\": true,\r\n                \"args\": [ \"/myhelper.dll\", \"debug\", \"start\", \"$config.port\" ],\r\n                \"isBuildCommand\": false,\r\n                \"showOutput\": \"always\",\r\n                \"options\": {\r\n                    \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n@isidorn @weinand

the better merge extension to vscode proper. (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pprice.better-merge). This will enable decoration, code-lenses and commands for \"standard\" style merge conflicts. \r\n\r\nNotable changes:\r\n - `better-merge.*` command contributions changed to `merge-conflict.*` with same keybindings and functionality. \r\n - Settings collapsed down to `merge-conflict.codeLens.enabled` and `merge-conflict.decorators.enabled`\r\n - Replace the single pass regex scanning of entire document, with line-by-line scanning, sans regex. \r\n - Added localization (`package.nls.json` and `vcode-nls` usage) support\r\n - Remove the `git` extension decoration of merge blocks. \r\n\r\nKnown TODOs: \r\n - Performance measurements for large files. Maximum to test up to is 5mb as anything larger is not synchronized with extensions. \r\n - It is possible to fire two scan **consumptions** from the same \"origin\" code, this mostly happens in `mergeDecorator.ts`, when a document is opened then active. The actual scan happens once as it is debounced via the delayer, BUT the merge decorators are sent to the document twice. I have a candidate fix in the works. \r\n - Replace hard-coded decorator colors with something to get theme colors when available. \r\n\r\nPotential TODOs (probably future PRs) \r\n - Support diff3 format\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27150/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":9,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27149","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27149/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27149/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27149/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27149","id":230770667,"number":27149,"title":"Workspace integrated terminal not overriding?","user":{"login":"Dogers","id":12223878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12223878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dogers","html_url":"https://github.com/Dogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dogers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-05-23T16:31:43Z","updated_at":"2017-05-24T21:45:16Z","closed_at":"2017-05-23T16:44:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.12.2 (19222cdc84ce72202478ba1cec5cb557b71163de, 2017-05-10T13:20:36.315Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|project-manager|alefragnani|0.17.0|\r\n|vscode-yaml-validation|djabraham|0.0.1|\r\n|python|donjayamanne|0.6.4|\r\n|xml|DotJoshJohnson|1.7.0|\r\n|tf-snippets|loganarnett|0.5.0|\r\n|terraform|mauve|0.0.16|\r\n|terraform-snippets|mindginative|1.4.2|\r\n|PowerShell|ms-vscode|1.1.0|\r\n|vscode-docker|PeterJausovec|0.0.14|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
