is something that the old BBEdit used to have, and is quite useful. \r\n\r\nTypically as a dev you will be doing the same types of searches across projects - for example \"search in all template files\", \"search through everything except logs and mock data\", etc. It would be useful to allow these sets to be saved in the user settings and then loaded up in other projects. The settings would be in a form similar to\r\n\r\n    searchFileGroups: {\r\n        \"everything except logs\": {\r\n            include: \"**/*\",\r\n            exclude: \"**/*.log\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"front end files\": {\r\n            include: \"**/*.html, **/*.tpl\"\r\n            exclude: \"build\"\r\n        }\r\n\r\nYou could have a small button in the search box to save the current group (an alert box would ask you for the name) and another to load a group (a floating panel would list them). Or even easier, both could be done in the action panel which shows up when you do CTRL-P.\r\nThanks\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24008/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24007","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24007/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24007/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24007/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/24007","id":219811953,"number":24007,"title":"Feature request: multifile searches and files to include should be saved and navigable with cursor key","user":{"login":"gotofritz","id":604900,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/604900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gotofritz","html_url":"https://github.com/gotofritz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gotofritz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gotofritz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gotofritz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gotofritz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gotofritz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gotofritz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gotofritz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gotofritz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gotofritz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-06T07:40:21Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T15:50:04Z","closed_at":"2017-04-06T15:49:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It is very useful to go back to previous searches, but there is no way to do so in VSC.

Introduction\r\n\r\nIt is very common for a project with webpack to use some kind of root resolve plugin which allows you to write import paths as if you were traversing from user defined root of the project directory.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nLet's assume I defined root directory as `src`.\r\n```\r\n.\r\n├── src\r\n│   ├── index.html\r\n│   ├── main.js\r\n│   ├── components\r\n│       └── Header\r\n│           └── Header.js\r\n│           └── index.js\r\n│   ├── util          \r\n│        └── foo.js\r\n```\r\nIf I want to import `foo` from within `Header.js` file I could write relative path or one taking advantage of root resolve plugin.\r\n```javascript \r\n// Header.js\r\nimport foo from '../../util/foo'\r\nimport foo from 'util/foo'\r\n```\r\nThese two imports are equivalent but `go to definition` works only on first one which si very unfortunate because in large project root resolve plugin is almost necessity to avoid crazy imports like `../../../../../foo`\r\n\r\n##
