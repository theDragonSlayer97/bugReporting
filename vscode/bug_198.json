gutter doesn't show when you Uppercase a filename (partial or full)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.Add some code to an existing repository and rename the filename with an Uppercase (in the screenshot app.js -> App.js)\r\n2.The git gutters disappear and the Source Control tab stage the changes with the old filename (app.js instead of App.js)\r\n3. Commit the staged changes\r\n4. Add some code to the renamed file\r\n5. Git gutters doesn't show again but the Working Tree looks good\r\n6. If you rename the files as before (App.js -> app.js) the git gutters appear correctly\r\n\r\n![img_003842-2017-06-29

perform some operations? We have `pre` and `post` callbacks in Atom Build for each task. \r\n\r\nSimple use case. User open @platformio Serial Monitor via integrated Terminal, we see it. He triggers \"Upload\" task, we temporary close opened Serial Port Monitors/Terminals, then uploading firmware. If a task fails with an error, we don't re-open Monitor. However, if the upload was successful, we re-open last Serial Port Monitor.\r\n\r\nThanks for the hints!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29854","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29854/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29854/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29854/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29854","id":239471924,"number":29854,"title":"gulp vscode-darwin fails locally with emmet error","user":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"ramya-rao-a","id":16890566,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16890566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a","html_url":"https://github.com/ramya-rao-a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ramya-rao-a","id":16890566,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16890566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a","html_url":"https://github.com/ramya-rao-a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramya-rao-a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-29T13:05:32Z","updated_at":"2017-06-29T13:32:08Z","closed_at":"2017-06-29T13:32:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When I run \r\n`gulp vscode-darwin`\r\nor\r\n`npm run gulp -- vscode-darwin`\r\n\r\nI always get the following error.
