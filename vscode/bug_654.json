of the success rate of new users trying to start a debug session has shown that we loose ~25% at the environment picker and another ~25% once the launch.json is generated. At the same time debugging is among our user success experiences.\r\n\r\nSome ideas that came up in discussions:\r\n- Add a \"More...\" entry at the end of the environment picker that opens the extension viewlet with other debug adapters.\r\n- Add more information to the 'debugMisconfiguration' event to be provided by the debug adapter to improve our understanding of what goes wrong.\r\n- If there is no launch.json yet: Try to avoid the picker and/or the generated launch.json based on the currently opened file and launch a debug session directly.\r\n- Improve the UX when the workbench did not open on a folder.

adds support for building [Flatpak](http://flatpak.org) application bundles, which should be runnable on any Linux distribution with [Flatpak support](http://flatpak.org/getting.html).\r\n\r\nNew Gulp tasks are added to prepare a directory with the needed files (`vscode-linux-${arch}-prepare-flatpak`), assembling the Flatpak bundles (`vscode-linux-${arch}-flatpak`), and for cleaning the build directories (`clean-vscode-linux-${arch}-flatpak`). This mimics how the Debian and RPM package creation works. Hence, building an application bundle is done with:\r\n \r\n```   \r\n$ gulp vscode-linux-x64-flatpak\r\n[...]\r\n$ ls *.flatpak\r\ncom.visualstudio.code.oss-x86_64.flatpak\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstalling and running the application is achieved with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ flatpak --user install --bundle com.visualstudio.code.oss-x86_64.flatpak\r\n$ flatpak run com.visualstudio.code.oss\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Removing `--user` would install the application system-wide.)\r\n\r\nThe `org.freedesktop.Platform` runtime needs to be installed for running the application, and for making builds the `org.freedesktop.Sdk` runtime is needed as well. There are [installation instructions in the Flatpak website](http://flatpak.org/index.html#users); the short version is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwget https://sdk.gnome.org/keys/gnome-sdk.gpg\r\nflatpak --user remote-add --gpg-import=gnome-sdk.gpg gnome https://sdk.gnome.org/repo/\r\nflatpak --user install org.freedesktop.Platform 1.4\r\nflatpak --user install org.freedesktop.Sdk 1.4\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe [flatpak-bundler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flatpak-bundler) development dependency provides an asynchronous API to invoke `flatpak-builder`. The [gulp-image-resize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-image-resize) module is used to\r\nincorporate scaling of the application icon to multiple sizes, and uses ImageMagick (or GraphicsMagick) under the hood, which is commonly available on most GNU/Linux distributions.\r\n\r\nInstead of building the Electron dependencies, this reuses the    `io.atom.electron.BaseApp` ([source](https://github.com/endlessm/electron-flatpak-base-app)) bundle as base application. The contents of the base application are imported at build time, and then Electron and the prepared files added on top. The prebuilt base application will be fetched automatically using the URL specified in the `baseFlatpakref` attribute, and it is kindly hosted at Amazon S3 by [Endless Computers](https://endlessm.com/).\r\n\r\nMerging this would tackle issue #7112.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16169/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16168","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16168/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16168/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16168/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16168","id":192099986,"number":16168,"title":"Add

Using such ref in my custom ``.d.ts`` ~doesn't seem to work, even~ only if I copy the whole ``node_modules\\@types\\[module_name]`` folder into the location where my custom typings file resides (and also after some time delay).\r\n\r\nIs it even possible? If not then consider it as request. Like f.e.\r\n```\r\n///<reference path=\"${auto-fetched-typings}/nunjucks/index.d.ts\" />\r\n///<reference auto-fetched-typings=\"nunjucks\" />\r\n```\r\nOr something...\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16152","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16152/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16152/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16152/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16152","id":192029656,"number":16152,"title":"Having
