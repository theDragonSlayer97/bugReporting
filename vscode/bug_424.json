Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI have a laptop with touchpad and scrolling (by touching the touchpad with two fingers and sliding them vertically) file content, files list, terminal window or anything inside VSCode behaves like I am pressing an holding up/down arrow keys. This behavior is not only annoying but it doesn't allow me to scroll say terminal window, because scrolling simply shows the list of last run commands - the same as if you press up arrow key multiple times. Horizontal scrolling behaves as left/right arrow keys - instead of scrolling horizontally, I move the caret. I have a wireless Microsoft mouse and when I use it for scrolling, everything works a expected. When I use my touchpad to scroll in the same way any other application like Chrome, Notepad, whatever, it behaves normally (the caret stays on its location and only the view is scrolled - actually I can normally scroll this GitHub's text area I am writing the issue text in). Does anyone have such problem with VSCode ? Could it because of touchpad drivers (I think mine is \"ELAN Pointing Device\") ?\r\n\r\nList of extensions:\r\n1 Debugger for Chrome 2.7.0\r\n2. Git History (git log) 0.2.0\r\n3. TSLint 0.8.1\r\n4. vscode-icons 7.4.0\r\n\r\nI tried to disable all extensions and reload VSCode but nothing changed.\r\n\r\nThe video below is made without using arrows keys - only scrolling functionality of my touchpad.\r\n\r\n\r\n![vscode-scroll-issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7610713/24226770/28c66286-0f71-11e7-921d-90efcfff4053.gif)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23061","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23061/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23061/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23061/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23061","id":216241785,"number":23061,"title":"Show

have been getting an alert popup every time I launch Code:\r\n\r\n`Version mismatch! global tsc (2.1.5) != VS Code's language service (2.2.1)`\r\n\r\nThe popup has a link to a \"more info\" page: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript#_using-newer-typescript-versions\r\n\r\nThat link is COMPLETELY USELESS for someone trying to resolve this issue normally and seems to focus entirely on providing advanced edge-case support for users who want to intentionally use different or non-standard tsc versions. It dances around what to do, and comes very close to explaining what to do, but never actually includes the critical guidance users need.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if I sound cranky here, but in the process of trying to resolve this issue repeatedly over the past month I found multiple bugs where other users have reported this exact same issue (driving many more users to comment on those issues) and they've all been closed with the unhelpful and ill-advised advice to \"just click the don't notify me again button\" or simply ignored for months:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11745\r\n- https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11772\r\n- https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs/issues/629\r\n\r\nBy my reading, the first issue was closed multiple times, the first and second issues were closed without any actual attention to the root cause, and the third issue has been open for almost six months with the only visible activity being to remove it from any milestone plans. \r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, the guidance users should be given to resolve this issue is:\r\n\r\n> Assuming the alert reports that VS Code's language service is using 2.2.1 (which can also be found by opening a typescript file in the editor and looking at the version number in the lower right corner of the Code editor's status bar), open the Code terminal window and type\r\n> `npm install -g typescript@2.2.1 `\r\n\r\nPLEASE fix this. It's not a hard problem, it impacts users every time they launch Code, and it shouldn't be continually buried in a closed bugs stack like this.\r\n\r\nPlease note also that the page does talk about npm install typescript@version, but it's deeply buried in hugely confusing and unnecessary surrounding text and context AND the non-global install did not fix this issue for me, I needed to do a -g global to fix it. The only mention of -g is in the context of \"npm list -g typescript\" which is informational but irrelevant because it wont resolve the user's issue.\r\n\r\nI've no idea how to submit a pull request on that \"more info\" page, so hopefully someone else can find a way to get that page fixed or change the URL of the \"more info\" button to point at an actually helpful page.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23054/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23053","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23053/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23053/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23053/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23053","id":216217399,"number":23053,"title":"can't
