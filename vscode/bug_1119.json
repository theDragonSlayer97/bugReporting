looking for clarification on the intended use of the api's in a \"normal\" extension vs a language server. It's common to give users the choice between an action happening when files are saved or as the user types. In a normal extension that uses the `vscode` api directly, the following is possible:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.documentListener = vscode.workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument(this.handleChange);\nthis.documentListener = vscode.workspace.onDidSaveTextDocument(this.handleSave);\n```\n\nThe object passed to the functions contains a nice `languageId` field to check to make sure you're only dealing with the right types of files.\n\nThe [official example](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node-example) illustrates it being done a bit differently in language servers. File changes are synced using a nice `documentSelector` which automatically handles the `languageId` above. To handle file saves, though, a file system watcher is used which only accepts a glob pattern. This example shows the `createFileSystemWatcher` call being used for `.clientrc` files, but if the extension needs to monitor `cpp` files, each possible C++ extension would have to be included in the blob. Have I missed a part of the api or is this the intended way for a language server to be able to respond to saves?\n\nLanguage Client:\n\n``` javascript\nlet clientOptions: LanguageClientOptions = {\n    documentSelector: ['plaintext'],\n    synchronize: {\n        configurationSection: 'languageServerExample',\n        fileEvents: workspace.createFileSystemWatcher('**/.clientrc')\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLanguage Server:\n\n``` javascript\ndocuments.onDidChangeContent((change) => {\n    validateTextDocument(change.document);\n});\n\nconnection.onDidChangeWatchedFiles((change) => {\n    connection.console.log('We recevied an file change event');\n});\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2199","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2199/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2199/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2199/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2199","id":128314306,"number":2199,"title":"\"A

[x] win @SofianHn \n- [x] mac @joaomoreno  \n- [x] linux @aeschli \n\nThe followings fixes and features enable the VSCode node debugger to better support remote debugging (which includes debugging into a docker container).\n- A remote debug session will no longer terminate after 3 seconds (a watchdog timer was tracking the **local** existence of the node process which does not really make sense in the remote case...)\n- the `attach` launch config got the `address` attribute back. So it is again possible to specify a TCP/IP address. Please note that remote debugging is only supported on recent versions of node.\n- the `attach` launch config now supports a `localRoot` and a `remoteRoot` attribute that can be used to map paths between a local VS Code project and a (remote) node folder. This works even locally on the same system or across different operating systems.\n\nVerify that you can remote debug node apps. Here are some examples for what scenarios to test:\n- debug a node app running inside a docker container (e.g. Windows -> Docker).\n- debug a node app running inside a virtual machine (e.g. Mac -> Window, Mac -> Linux).\n- debug a node app running locally from a different folder than the VS Code workspace.\n- debug a node app running on a real remote system.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2187","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2187/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2187/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2187/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2187","id":128202637,"number":2187,"title":"Find

[x] win @SofianHn \n- [x] mac @joaomoreno \n- [x] linux @aeschli \n\nNode debugging now supports source maps with \"inlined source\" (Please find the definition of \"inlined source\" vs. \"inlined source maps\" below).\n\nHere is the strategy in what situations VSCode will use \"inlined source\":\nVSCode always tries to locate the source on disk first. If it cannot find the source (e.g. because there is none or because the paths in the source maps are broken), VSCode will use the \"inlined source\" if available. If there is no inlined source, VSCode will fall back to stream the file contents from node itself.\n\nIf the editor contents is not loaded by VSCode from the file system but comes from the debug adapter, the editor will be in readonly mode and the \"origin\" of the editor contents is shown in the editor title:\n\n![2016-01-22

verify that VSCode uses the strategy from above for showing the source\n- verify that you can step through inlined source\n- verify that breakpoints can be set in inlined source and that they are persisted\n- combine inlined source and inlined source maps and verify that still everything works.\n\n**Note:** \"inlined source\" and \"inlined source maps\" are orthogonal features (and VSCode supports both either alone or in combination):\n- _inlined source maps:_ the contents of the source map does not live in a file but is a data url at the end of the generated file\n- _inlined source:_ the contents of the original source file does not live in a file but is included in the source map.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2182","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2182/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2182/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2182/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2182","id":128159758,"number":2182,"title":"Document
