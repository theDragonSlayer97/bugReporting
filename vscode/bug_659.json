This issue was addressed by pointing to a specific repository key (#languages).\r\n  * ensure \"fuzzy\" syntax highlighting for PHP/HTML code so that script start tags are not required\r\n\r\nclose #14166, close #3746","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16005","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16005/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16005/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16005/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16005","id":191469400,"number":16005,"title":"Feature Request","user":{"login":"joaomaridalho","id":16777249,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16777249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomaridalho","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomaridalho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomaridalho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomaridalho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomaridalho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomaridalho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomaridalho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomaridalho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomaridalho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomaridalho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomaridalho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-11-24T09:23:26Z","updated_at":"2016-11-24T10:27:06Z","closed_at":"2016-11-24T10:06:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\nFTP Upload like NetBeans with file selection, Sync and download.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16004","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16004/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16004/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16004/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16004","id":191466127,"number":16004,"title":"Add option to force a maximum number of consecutive blank lines in files","user":{"login":"mdebruijne","id":11375308,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11375308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdebruijne","html_url":"https://github.com/mdebruijne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdebruijne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdebruijne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdebruijne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdebruijne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdebruijne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdebruijne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdebruijne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdebruijne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdebruijne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":427411234,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/extension-candidate","name":"extension-candidate","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-11-24T09:06:40Z","updated_at":"2016-11-24T10:12:18Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I know this can be resolved with extensions, but this is a very common and language neutral feature.

VSCode Version: 1.7.2\r\n- OS Version: macOS Sierra 10.12 Public Beta (16B2657)\r\n\r\nMy idea is to open files supported by the OS, VSC extensions, etc as a file in preview mode. For example, right clicking an html file then clicking \"Open as Preview\" will open a new tab as if its a file and show the contents in a simple frame. If you are wanting to see an example I've edited to look like the new feature I'm requesting, well here you go...\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/gUeMsUo.jpg)\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/Knt9UsA.jpg)\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, I'm not the best at photoshopping but I did my best. This is kind of what I mean. If the file is being view without a workspace (alone as a single file), then there would be a button next to \"Split view\" at the top right near the exit button that will open the file as a preview file if it is supported by an extension, software, raw file view by OS or is supported by VSC. If the file you want to preview is in a workspace (currently open is a folder viewing workspace), then there would be an option to right click the file then \"Open as Preview\" or the same way you would open it as a singular file (without workspace). I tried my best to explain what I mean but if you are still having trouble understanding, just take a look at the images above. Please note that there is a reload button on the top right of the preview side of the second image, that will reload the preview to be updated with the code.
