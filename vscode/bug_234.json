MarkDown preview functionality is extremely handy and I'd like to suggest and improvement where the preview contains a button for downloading the generated preview HTML as a standalone file that can be shared with team members who don't know how to open MarkDown files.\r\n\r\nThe obvious question is how to handle images, the options range from just leaving the paths alone and make it a responsibility of the user to make sure they are zipped together with the file, they could also be inlined as BASE64 URIs or instead of saving HTML preview, PDF print preview could be saved with the images embedded within.\r\n\r\nFor the start I think the first option where the user is required to keep their relative paths in check and zip the images with the downloaded file themselves works best.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28796","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28796/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28796/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28796/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28796","id":236124327,"number":28796,"title":"Randomly

find in terminal functionality was added in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15198.
