Upgrade VSCode, see lots of log messages about how it's installing RC3 ... which I don't get, given that I just installed RC2 - did I miss the memo about Insiders using RC3 when RC2 comes out?\n   But then, clicking on the release notes, leads me to 1.2.0 release notes, for May 2016, and looks like an empty template...And finally, it looks like 10.10.x64 is getting left behind...and I must have not seen it, because the logs are saying that \"The project does not list one of 'osx.10.10-x64' in the 'runtimes' section.\" And it suggests that I run dotnet restore, which I do, but then it downloads rc-1 stuff, which I no longer want...Actually, here's the full set of errors which came at the end:\n\nError: Can not find runtime target for framework 'DNXCore,Version=v5.0' compatible with one of the target runtimes: 'osx.10.10-x64'. Possible causes:\n1. The project has not been restored or restore failed - run `dotnet restore`\n2. The project does not list one of 'osx.10.10-x64' in the 'runtimes' section.\nError: \n\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: Can not find runtime target for framework 'DNXCore,Version=v5.0' compatible with one of the target runtimes: 'osx.10.10-x64'.

The error under function is still visible until re-build also.\n\nShould the error for semi-colons at the end of words/defns be moved to under the semi-colon instead? \n\n![nolintupdate](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12900364/15304556/db11627c-1b72-11e6-863b-c314c4bffc13.gif)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6403","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6403/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6403/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6403/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6403","id":155117341,"number":6403,"title":"When resolving a merge conflict allow accepting Git's default commit message","user":{"login":"mohsen1","id":543633,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/543633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohsen1","html_url":"https://github.com/mohsen1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohsen1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohsen1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohsen1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohsen1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohsen1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohsen1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohsen1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohsen1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohsen1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":296835379,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/git","name":"git","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":256129996,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"fef2c0","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-16T20:43:01Z","updated_at":"2017-06-01T22:14:05Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.1.1\n- OS Version: OS X\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. get into a merge conflict \n2.
