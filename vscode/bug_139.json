Andre pointed out:\r\n\r\n@isidorn in EH debugging, the launchRequest starts the extension host (via VS Code) but the DA does not connect (aka \"attach\") to it (in normal \"node\" debugging the DA connects to the launched debuggee automatically).\r\n\r\nInstead VS Code knows when the EH is ready and then broadcasts an event that you will pick up and issue the missing \"attach\" request for it. This is basically the same sequence as the \"reload EH window\" sequence.\r\n\r\nFor the \"attach\" request that you issue in response to the broadcast, you use the initial \"launch\" configuration and just change the \"request\" attribute from \"launch\" to \"attach\".\r\nSince the initial \"launch\" config uses the type \"extensionHost\", the \"attach\" uses that too.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to remember the massaged launch config (that got the type \"extensionHost2\"), and create the \"attach\" config based on this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31658","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31658/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31658/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31658/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31658","id":246323141,"number":31658,"title":"rxjs/Observable - [ts] Argument of type '\"Hello\"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number[]'","user":{"login":"wts20","id":1216054,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1216054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wts20","html_url":"https://github.com/wts20","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wts20/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wts20/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wts20/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wts20/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wts20/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wts20/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wts20/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wts20/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wts20/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-28T11:37:02Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T18:17:41Z","closed_at":"2017-07-28T18:17:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.14.2 (cb82febafda0c8c199b9201ad274e25d9a76874e, 2017-07-19T23:34:09.706Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.15063\r\n- Extensions: none\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
