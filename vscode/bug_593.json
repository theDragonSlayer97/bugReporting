Open Source.\" which suggests free software to anyone who knows what the difference of \"free\" and \"open-source\" in the common word use is\r\n\r\n2. Below it immediately offers download buttons  for something licensed under https://code.visualstudio.com/License/ which is **absolutely not free software in any modern definition of the word**.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the website's main page is right now *incorrect  and extremely misleading*, since the advertised version on the main page is not \"Free.\" at all as stated prominently.\r\n\r\nI am aware the actual licensing page clears this up in a small remark at the top, but anyone just browsing to the main page and thinking about downloading it is almost guaranteed to be misled, and they might even think they got something under a free software license without realizing by downloading they just agreed to a classic non-free EULA which doesn't respect many basic user rights like disassembling and analyzing the software, or providing the software to others as a hosted solution and other non-free restrictions.\r\n\r\nPlease fix the labeling on the main page and clearly advertise the non-free version on the website as what it is, and stop misleading users.\r\n\r\n---\r\nAlso, this has been brought up before and you have refused to do so, but I implore you to simply abandon this model entirely. All this confusion and naming mess is just because you insist on twisting a free software into some weird proprietary branded spin-off that doesn't add much except a logo. As you can see, all it leads to is confusion, misleading remarks and even borderline false advertising, which is absolutely not worthy of a company that is clearly trying to embrace open-source and free software and getting rid of their old image from the past.\r\n\r\nPlease note it is possible to write binding trademark / branding guidelines to allow protected use of a name like \"Visual Studio\" in a free software product by the community, so you wouldn't need to do this just to be able to brand Visual Studio Code nicely.\r\n\r\nEdit:  the full source of that version isn't available either, is it? It is altered from the GitHub variant after all - so the main download is probably not even \"Open Source.\" in a strict definition of the expression, as strongly suggested by the landing page...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17996/reactions","total_count":35,"+1":23,"-1":3,"laugh":4,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17995","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17995/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17995/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17995/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17995","id":198279526,"number":17995,"title":"Issue about Setting-window.zoomLevel and webpage that browse extensions content","user":{"login":"Shyancc","id":24191122,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/24191122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shyancc","html_url":"https://github.com/Shyancc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shyancc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shyancc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shyancc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shyancc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shyancc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shyancc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shyancc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shyancc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shyancc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-01T19:57:38Z","updated_at":"2017-01-02T06:07:22Z","closed_at":"2017-01-02T06:07:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:1.8.1\r\n- OS Version:win7\r\n\r\n    My screen resolution is 1920*1080.It makes the fontsize by default on the sidebar or tabslabels too small for me, so I set the window.zoomLevel at 2.

The hyphen makes it confusing. As you can see with my edits, I initially thought it was meant to be \"OSS Dev\"\r\n2. It's not similar enough to \"Visual Studio Code\". Having the same project named \"Visual Studio Code\" (branded), \"vscode\" (OSS repo)\", \"Code - OSS Dev\" (built OSS version), and sometimes just \"Code\" when talking about it is pretty problematic because people might not realize it is essentially the same program.\r\n\r\nThis is even more problematic if you consider that the OSS version is already so separate with no official prebuilt packages and the official site has only proprietary EULA branded packages, so making the name so vastly different just makes the situation even more confusing for the user.\r\n\r\nCompare for example with Oracle (yes I know they also do bad stuff to OSS, but this is one thing they did right):\r\n- JDK vs OpenJDK\r\n- VirtualBox vs VirtualBox OSE\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nIf the current naming was done because the \"Visual Studio\" name is protected, then please have your lawyers write a community use policy of the name so it can be used in the open-source builds too (as \"Visual Studio Code OSS\" or similar).
