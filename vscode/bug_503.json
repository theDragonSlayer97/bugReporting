That does not seem to be the case.\r\n\r\nI expect the tasks to start in the current working directory of \"test_dir\", but instead they start in the workspace directory as normal. The \"cwd-test2\" task exists solely to prove that the directory in question is available and accessible.\r\n\r\nOutput from the tasks:\r\n\r\n**[env-test1]**\r\n`PTYSHELLARG1=env | grep TESTING_ENV`\r\n`Press any key to close the terminal`\r\n\r\n**[env-test2]**\r\n`Test:`\r\n`Press any key to close the terminal`\r\n\r\n**[cwd-test1]**\r\n`/tmp/options_bug`\r\n`Press any key to close the terminal`\r\n\r\n**[cwd-test2]**\r\n`/tmp/options_bug/test_dir`\r\n`Press any key to close the terminal`\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4859","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"AED5:24885:2C6977:3AEA9E:59D93C62","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=504>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=502>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"e30b167ef703091cdd55cfbaf4546d24\"","status":"200 OK"}}
