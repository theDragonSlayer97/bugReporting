Open Code, but won't open and there are no errors displayed.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nThis time around I resolved the issue by narrowing the following Hack in two steps:\r\n\r\n1. Copy the system file 'libxcb.so.1.1.0' to the VS Code Insider folder:\r\n```\r\ncopy /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb.so.1.1.0 /usr/share/code-insider\r\n```\r\n2. Last execute the sed stream editor command to alter value:\r\n```\r\nsudo sed -i 's/BIG-REQUESTS/_IG-REQUESTS/' /usr/share/code-insider/libxcb.so.1.1.0\r\n```\r\nAfter these step were completed, I was able to open VS Code Insider on a xrdp session.\r\nmust important I didn't have to alter the system file \"libxcb.so.1.1.0\" as in previous posts was done in the \"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/\" location.\r\n\r\n(Below image shows implemented hack)\r\n![xrpd_vscode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19892435/31132367-9bc62c56-a82a-11e7-94cb-16a3db125d2b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes/No","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35529","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35529/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35529/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35529/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35529","id":262455616,"number":35529,"title":"Test: debug focus actions","user":{"login":"isidorn","id":1926584,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1926584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn","html_url":"https://github.com/isidorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isidorn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/52/labels","id":2743006,"number":52,"title":"October 2017","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":132,"closed_issues":80,"state":"open","created_at":"2017-09-04T12:33:25Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T21:07:33Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-10-03T14:42:20Z","updated_at":"2017-10-03T14:42:20Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- [ ] any os\r\n\r\nRefs: #35153\r\nComplexity: 1\r\n\r\nWe have new actions to focus different debug views.

However, for small values it is which is why this probably hasn't been noticed before. For (2) its because at the end of the function we just flatten the groups, without respect to the initial input order.
