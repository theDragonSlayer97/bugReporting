Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.11.2 and 1.12.0 - insiders\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\n-- Sorry for the English, I used Google Translator --\r\n\r\nWhen I set a shortcut, if you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>, the VSCode is waiting for a second combination. Which works great.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if I press any keyboard and then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>, this key takes the function of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> and always waits for a second combination.\r\n\r\nExample: <kbd>n</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>\r\n\r\nIf you type a text and press <kbd>n</kbd> it is waiting for the second combination.\r\n\r\nI know the same open multiple ports for shortcuts, but maybe one maybe a setting where I only limit use to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> to receive a second combination.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is (I do not know if it's possible):\r\n\r\n1- Limit second combination only to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>, or until the user changes.\r\n2- Whenever you have this situation, reverse the shortcuts automatically, either on the new screen or manually. If you typed <kbd>n</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> it should interpret or edit the file for <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> <kbd>n</kbd>\r\n3 - Prevent saving the shortcut key if it is wrong or prevents it from working.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25355","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25355/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25355/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25355/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25355","id":224308067,"number":25355,"title":"Solarized

Type anything between quotes\r\n2. Put cursor between the cursor on what you just typed and use expand selection (Alt+Shift+Right Arrow)\r\n3. Try it first with Dark+ (default) theme or Dracula Theme and then with Mattia Astornio's Material Theme or with Nord theme\r\n\r\nThing to notice: If the quotes are colored as same as text, it includes it in the selection, but it doesn't if it has different color assigned. \r\n\r\n![ff2de466-29bb-11e7-9230-5e5ff7f0443d](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26769888/25409665/81d88366-2a30-11e7-85ee-4011b1739ddf.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-do: Expand selection should not include quotes, but just the text because a lot of times we need to change what is inside the quotes only. Putting quotes around the text again will add one step more.\r\n\r\nOriginally posted on Dracula theme repo, but as it also includes the default Dark+ theme and seems to be like a bug in VS Code itself, which I found a lot of people like and stick to it, so I put it here too.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code/issues/24#issuecomment-297170876\r\n(Below one is copied from the link above)\r\nScopes of interest:\r\n* punctuation.definition.string.begin\r\n* punctuation.definition.string.end\r\nWhen set to a different color than string, it expands correctly.
