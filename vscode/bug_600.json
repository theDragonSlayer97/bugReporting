is in relation to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17574, https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17397, https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17360.\r\n\r\nLike I said in those issues, I remarked that looking for extensions on the marketplace and installing them don't use the same \"piece of code\". And indeed, listing extensions and their properties is done by the main process which has access to ExtensionManagementService. The latter doesn't seem to care about the config \"http.proxy\", but can nonetheless use the default system proxy. So far, so good.\r\n\r\nHowever, when \"install\" is pressed on the screen, the IExtensionManagementService is resolved as ExtensionManagementChannelClient which will call via ipc the Shared process which will finally call ExtensionManagementService. What's astonishing is that the same piece of code now cares about \"http.proxy\" and when it's not set, it cannot use the default system proxy.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**\r\nThis PR aims at fixing the issues with http proxy or otherwise be a starting point 😁 \r\nTo test that the behaviours of searchs & installs are different you can add the following user setting: \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"http.proxy\": \"http://dummy.proxy:8080\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Is the fix proposed here the right thing to do or does it hide another bug?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17785","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17785/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17785/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17785/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17785","id":197421897,"number":17785,"title":"With

Double click a php/css/js file \r\n2. Observe that the program opens with \"untitled.text\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the program opens via right click - both folders and individual files and also using \"Control-O\",  double-clicking a file in Windows file-manager doesn't open a file and instead just opens \"untitled.txt\". This is useful to have if I need to edit a remote file using an FTP manager such as Filezilla.

http://stackoverflow.com/a/30083688/8151 I've had numerous experiences where file changes triggered by source control activity have overwritten the current state of a buffer. In one case this has caused the loss of a great deal of work but since I realized the behavior it's been more of a (significant) annoyance.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a file.\r\n2. Make a few changes\r\n3. Trigger a source control event that overwrites or deletes the file on disk.\r\n4. Depending on the type of file changes, VS Code either silently updates the buffer or pops a warning saying the file can no longer be found and offering to create it. My experiences have generally been with Perforce as the source control provider, but others in the stackoverflow question seem to have experienced it with git as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17772","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17772/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17772/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17772/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/17772","id":197372205,"number":17772,"title":"Copy/Cut and Paste are broken","user":{"login":"lmmfranco","id":5719409,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5719409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmfranco","html_url":"https://github.com/lmmfranco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmfranco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmfranco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmfranco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmfranco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmfranco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmfranco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmfranco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmfranco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmmfranco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-12-23T13:48:17Z","updated_at":"2016-12-25T16:23:03Z","closed_at":"2016-12-23T14:58:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.8.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 / Ubuntu 14\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
