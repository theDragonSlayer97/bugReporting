The minimal sample codes:\r\n```ts\r\ninterface Component<P, S> {\r\n  componentWillMount?(): void;\r\n  componentDidMount?(): void;\r\n  componentWillReceiveProps?(nextProps: Readonly<P>, nextContext: any): void;\r\n  shouldComponentUpdate?(nextProps: Readonly<P>, nextState: Readonly<S>, nextContext: any): boolean;\r\n  componentWillUpdate?(nextProps: Readonly<P>, nextState: Readonly<S>, nextContext: any): void;\r\n  componentDidUpdate?(prevProps: Readonly<P>, prevState: Readonly<S>, prevContext: any): void;\r\n  componentWillUnmount?(): void;\r\n}\r\nclass Component<P, S> {\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass MyComponent extends Component<{}, {}> {\r\n  // Mark1\r\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState, nextContext) {}\r\n  // Mark2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Two problems:\r\n\r\n    a. [maybe bug] At Mark1 and Mark 2, typing ctrl + space gives me intelligence suggestion: all the life cycle methods. MyComponent just extends the Component not implements it. Compare with typescript playground, I can't even get any suggestions in `extends` or `implements` way. Does it is a bug that we get suggestions?\r\n\r\n    b. Assuming point a is normal behavior. \r\n        [bug] At Mark1, after popping suggested methods and select, auto-completion provides us the full method skeleton. e.g. type character 'c' (or ctrl + space), then select the `componentDidUpdate`, auto-completion produces 'componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, prevContext)'.\r\n        [bug] At Mark2, type character 'c', I can't get any methods suggestion.\r\n        [bug] At Mark2, type ctrl + space, I get the unused methods suggestion. If I select one, auto-completion only produces the method's name. e.g. 'componentWillReceiveProps'. I have to fill the parameters, compare with Mark1 the different behavior make me confused.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32999","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32999/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32999/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32999/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32999","id":252155497,"number":32999,"title":"focus opened file when opened from Explorer Side Bar","user":{"login":"ad8e","id":19739817,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19739817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ad8e","html_url":"https://github.com/ad8e","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ad8e/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ad8e/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ad8e/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ad8e/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ad8e/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ad8e/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ad8e/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ad8e/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ad8e/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":421131022,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/as-designed","name":"as-designed","color":"E2A1C2","default":false},{"id":296838217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/ux","name":"ux","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-08-23T04:19:39Z","updated_at":"2017-08-24T06:02:11Z","closed_at":"2017-08-24T06:02:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
