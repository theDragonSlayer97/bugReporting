matching is nearly invisible (opacity: 0.1!) and secondary cursors are nearly as bad, and it's unclear whether these things are even themable. Whether they are or not, you shouldn't have to go searching for a whole different theme or learn to build your own themes just to make a basic widget usable.\n\nYou could start by just putting a few of these in the global preferences, ex:\nBracket matching style: [outline, underline, background]\nBracket matching color: [rgba()]\nSecondary cursor width: [1px, 2px, 3px]\nSecondary cursor color: [rgba()]\n\nJust those two would be a great improvement, but an even nicer approach would be an additional user settings file (like Atom's \"styles.cson\") that offered a large selection of options for styling non-themable items and overriding individual settings in the current theme. Some things such as the subtle distinction between 2-shade highlighting schemes (ex: all found items vs. the one current found item) or the faint ghost outline used by some themes as the current line highlight are too subtle to see at a glance, even with good vision, and it would be great if we could make it easier for users to see comfortably (or distinguish shades of color) by simply filling in a few `style: [x | y | z]` or `color: [rgba]` settings in a \"styles overide\" file rather than requiring a time-consuming detour from your real work into research on the issue of what can be themed and how.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4086/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4085","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4085/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4085/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4085/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4085","id":140470844,"number":4085,"title":"TS

present, using ESNext features such as decorators, async/await, class instance fields, etc. results in the editor drawing red squiggles. In the very least, it would be nice if there was an easy way to stop VSCode from complaining about these features in a normal .js file.\n\nPerhaps some thought needs to go into how VSCode will handle the evolution of ES in general. With developers using tools like Babel, and opting into stage-n features before they are finalized as a norm, I think this is going to crop up more and more. Not to mention that popular frameworks like Aurelia, React, Ember and Angular 2 are using these features more.\n\nAs for me, I have a hard time recommending VSCode to anyone that isn't doing TypeScript or sticking strictly to ES2015. It gets ugly pretty quick otherwise. I'm looking forward to seeing this improve. It's the only thing really holding me back.
