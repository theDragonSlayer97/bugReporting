we are on Electron 1.3.x there is more API support to find out if a screen reader is attached or not. The related API is:\n- `accessibility-support-changed` [event](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/app.md#event-accessibility-support-changed-macos-windows)\n- a new [method](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/app.md#appisaccessibilitysupportenabled-macos-windows) `app.isAccessibilitySupportEnabled()`\n\nI verified that these work on Windows and Mac. On Mac the event works when changing the native screen reader (Cmd+F5). On Windows I tried with NVDA and the only thing that was not working is that the event would fire when turning OFF NVDA, but turning ON was ok.\n\n@alexandrudima I think you expressed some interest in this, so I am moving this to you first to see if we want to use it. I can then look into how to surface this API as workbench API for you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14591","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14591/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14591/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14591/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14591","id":185630039,"number":14591,"title":"Window title not updated on Open Recent","user":{"login":"92cad2ed","id":23097273,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/23097273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/92cad2ed","html_url":"https://github.com/92cad2ed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/92cad2ed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/92cad2ed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/92cad2ed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/92cad2ed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/92cad2ed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/92cad2ed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/92cad2ed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/92cad2ed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/92cad2ed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-27T10:26:18Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T11:19:31Z","closed_at":"2016-10-27T11:19:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version:\n  Version 1.6.0\n  Commit e25fb0bc\n  Shell 1.3.7\n  Renderer 52.0.2743.82\n  Node 6.5.0\n- OS Version:\n  Windows 7\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

Open a new file\n2. If indentation is set to spaces, click the \"Spaces\" button in the bottom status bar to switch to tab indentation, and a tab size of 4.\n3. Into the empty file, enter `[tab]23456789` (where \"[tab]\" is a tab character)\n4. Click the Ln/Col indicator in the status bar and go to position 1,5 (line 1, column 5)\n5. The cursor will now be placed between \"4\" and \"5\", indicating that the \"go to line,col\" command treated the tab as 1 \"column\", but the line/col indicator in the status bar shows \"Ln 1, Col 8\", indicating that it treats the tab as 4 \"columns\".\n\nI can't say which is correct -- treating a tab as 1 \"column\" or treating it as 4 \"columns\" (if it is represented as 4 spaces), but my feeling is that the former is better (compilers and the like would report character counts with tabs only counting as 1, right?). However, it's clear that whichever mode should be used, the goto command and the line/column indicator should be consistent.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14584","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14584/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14584/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14584/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14584","id":185609650,"number":14584,"title":"Code
