VSCode Version: 1.5.2\n- Mac OS Version: 10.11.6\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n**Step 1:** Create a project that uses `webpack` to bundle some JS—running it through `eslint` first and telling `eslint` to fix any errors where possible:\n\n``` json\n// package.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"webpack\",\n    \"watch\": \"webpack --watch\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"eslint\": \"^3.5.0\",\n    \"eslint-loader\": \"^1.5.0\",\n    \"webpack\": \"^1.13.2\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n``` js\n// webpack.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: './index.js',\n  output: {\n    filename: 'bundle.js'\n  },\n  module: {\n    preLoaders: [{\n      test: /\\.js$/,\n      loader: 'eslint',\n      query: {\n        fix: true\n      }\n    }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Create an `.eslintrc` file that has a rule that can be automatically fixed—like `\"semi\": [2, \"never\"]`:\n\n``` json\n// .eslintrc\n{\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"semi\": [2, \"never\"]\n  } \n}\n```\n\n**Step 3:** Add some code in `index.js` (the webpack entry file) that breaks this rule:\n\n``` js\n// index.js\nvar foo = 'foo';\n```\n\n**Step 4:** Run webpack in watch mode `npm run watch`\n\n**Step 5:** Observe that the trailing semi colon in `index.js` has been automatically removed by `eslint` _and_ that the file in VS Code reflect this\n\n**Step 6:** With webpack still watching the file, add the semi colon back in again from within VS Code and then observe that VS Code does not refresh/reload this file when it is fixed a second time by `eslint`\n\n**Step 7:** Confirm that `index.js` has been fixed by inspecting it in your file system _or_ closing the file in VS Code and then opening it again\n\nNotice that VS Code refreshes the file as expected when the file is first fixed, but on each subsequent fix, the file does not reload/refresh in VS Code. This works fine in SublimeText, so I assume it is a bug of VS Code's file watcher.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12077/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12076","id":177181872,"number":12076,"title":"Add
