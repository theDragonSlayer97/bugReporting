Take the new caches in [glob](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/base/common/glob.ts#L259), similar cases [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/base/common/glob.ts#L238) and [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/base/common/strings.ts#L270)\n\nThere is two problems, (1) they stop being a cache when their limit is reached and new elements come along, and (2) they are slow because every check for the size iterates over all elements and puts them in an array. For example, the worst case for [`normalizeNFC`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/base/common/strings.ts#L270) is to allocate an array with 10000 elements just to figure out that the cache is useless.\n\nSince we have learnt that unbounded arrays aren't a wise choice, we should use a better caching strategy. Use an array and binarySearch or manually keep track of the length\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5620","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5620/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5620/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5620/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5620","id":150139065,"number":5620,"title":"几个建议

all,\n\nI prefer the mouse wheel to scroll single lines in VS Code, and happily, there's a separate configuration setting to control this without disturbing my global system settings. When `editor.mouseWheelScrollSensitivity` is set to its default value of `1`, the mouse wheel on my system scrolls 3 lines, but by setting it to `0.33` - at least, in previous versions of VS Code - I got the desired behavior of single line scrolling.\n\nUnfortunately, the seemingly innocuous \"small perf tweaks\" commit https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/4752/commits/79eda2eaefa014dc2d79c73fa66bf44c59213e0c from a few weeks ago introduced some regressions, one of which is to truncate float values due to the adding of `|0` after every numerical preference value assignment, including `editor.mouseWheelScrollSensitivity`.\n\nPlease consider fixing this and restoring the previous behavior. Thanks!\n- VSCode Version: 1.0.1-insider\n- OS Version: Windows 8\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Set, for example, `\"editor.mouseWheelScrollSensitivity\": 0.33` in user or workspace preferences.\n2. Watch your mouse scroll wheel have no effect due to its value being changed to `0`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5617","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5617/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5617/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5617/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5617","id":150113426,"number":5617,"title":"[ruby]

this PR is for issue #4541 - Korean characters problem\n- fix displaying Korean letters twice during composition\n- show composition letters between the text not over the text\n\nDoing so, I added ICompositionEvent that has 'data' field. On 'compositionupdate' events, textarea is changed by composition data.\n\nTo show composition letters between the text, the visibleRange is calculated every compositionupdate event with composition word. It can be expensive.\n\nI changed the variable shouldEmptyTextArea to be always true because I think textarea should be empty when composition starts but I didn't test with other browsers (How?).\n\nSymptom (VSCode v1.0, type 'dkssudgktpdy')\n![animation1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3759882/14712510/60204442-0818-11e6-8619-1bfae520c0ce.gif)\n\nExpected (there are two cursors.. it must be fix either)\n![animation2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3759882/14712512/6021ba2a-0818-11e6-8eaa-b5530be103d2.gif)\n\nAnd When I composite letters between the text, the letters are displayed over the text. But Korean IME doesn't act like that.  (type 'gksrmf')\n![animation3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3759882/14712511/6020be68-0818-11e6-8753-643345f8f414.gif)\n\nExpected\n![animation4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3759882/14712513/60223d2e-0818-11e6-8753-fd57da33db7c.gif)\n\nIt is confused that Japanese IME usually show composition letters over the text (in the notepad) but when I tested with Microsoft Word, the composition letters are occupied between the text.
