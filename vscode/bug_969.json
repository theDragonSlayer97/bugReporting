VSCode Version: 1.1.0\n- OS Version: OSX El Capitan 10.11\n\nThe autocomplete should always prefer displaying the user variables, if possible sort by scope, local variables first.\n\nI find frustrating to type a couple of letters and still get a bunch of code snippets I never use.\n\nYou might have a reason for that, maybe other people use those snippets far more than the local variables, then it would be great to be able to disable the snippets and `window.*`.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open a JavaScript file, \n2. Add `var eventData = \"hi\";` and `var eventName = \"hello\"`\n3. Type `ev` in the next line.\n\n![screen shot 2016-05-23 at 11 19 22
