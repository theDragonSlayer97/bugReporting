I'll highlight the operator, such as the `>=` in `if(a >= b) { ...`, then type the correct operator, such as `<`. In VS Code 1.6, I've noticed that it is treating angle brackets in the same way as other types of brackets when applied to a selection, presumably for the purposes of improved editing of casting syntax and generic type arguments. In my example above, this means that rather than replacing my selection with the correct operator, it changes `>=` into `<>=>`, which is obviously not what was desired.\n\nI want autocompletion in general, but I'd like to turn it off for angle brackets in TypeScript, as I find it more of a hindrance than a help. Is there an option for this, and if not, could it be added in a future version of VS Code? Note that turning it off should be a language-specific feature, as it would be undesirable to also turn it off for tsx, jsx, xml and html.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13962","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13962/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13962/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13962/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13962","id":183805093,"number":13962,"title":"Hide explorer by default","user":{"login":"regs01","id":10468217,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10468217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regs01","html_url":"https://github.com/regs01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regs01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regs01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regs01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regs01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regs01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regs01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regs01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regs01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regs01/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-18T21:15:35Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T21:52:28Z","closed_at":"2016-10-18T21:52:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.6.1\n- OS Version: Windows 10 1607\n\nHow do we make explorer not to forcibly show when opening a file?

When I run VSCode the CPU is used heavily and the fan makes a lot of noise. This is happening just recently when I started using VSCode with C code. Specifically I am viewing code for the `pjsim` project on GitHub. Perhaps loading up that project on a Mac (El Capitan) with VSCode will be a way to reproduce the problem.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Clone `pjsim` project from GitHub https://github.com/chakrit/pjsip\n2. Open that folder with VSCode\n3. Install the recommended plugins for C/C++\n4. Restart VSCode\n5. Wait for the CPP plugins to wreak havoc on all that is good and holy\n\nIt appears to not cause any trouble without the recommended CPP plugins. The Microsoft CPP and Clang plugins for C/C++ have been downloaded a lot and have high ratings so I expected them to be alright.\n\nOne potentially important detail is that I am running a beta release of Xcode (8.1 beta 3) and have that path selected with `Xcode-select`. If that is somehow the cause for this trouble it would be best to resolve it before the final 8.1 release is out.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13957","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13957/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13957/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13957/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13957","id":183772775,"number":13957,"title":"Collapse disappears","user":{"login":"Zawgar","id":13787811,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13787811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawgar","html_url":"https://github.com/Zawgar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawgar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawgar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawgar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawgar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawgar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawgar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawgar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawgar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawgar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":331200031,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-folding","name":"editor-folding","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":15,"created_at":"2016-10-18T18:55:16Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T16:18:51Z","closed_at":"2016-11-04T16:18:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.6.1 (9e4e44c19e393803e2b05fe2323cf4ed7e36880e, 2016-10-13T16:21:53.542Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 6.1.7601\n- Extensions: abusaidm.html-snippets-0.0.17, donjayamanne.githistory-0.1.0, donjayamanne.jquerysnippets-0.0.1\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
