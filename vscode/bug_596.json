Create a new snippet (e.g. for language javascript (babel)).\r\n2. Define a body with multiple tabstops. E.g.\r\n\r\n\t\t\"Arrow Function\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"prefix\": \"arrow\",\r\n\t\t\t\"body\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t\"${1:($2)} => {$0}\"\r\n\t\t\t],\r\n\t\t\t\"description\": \"An ES6 arrow function\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n3. Open a file with the specific language and expand the snippet. \r\n4. Try to tab to each of the stops.\r\n\r\n![snippetissue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2437424/21549319/14f1109a-cdb7-11e6-8278-bbee63544b25.gif)\r\n\r\nThe snippet expands and it looks like the first tabstop is respected but the rest are not. \r\n\r\nI've tried this in several language snippet files, with and without placeholders, and with and without the vim extension installed. I get the same result in any case. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need any other information. I'm loving VSCode (seriously, you guys took a previously anti-MS person and switched him(me) over from vim and sublime as my go to editors) and I'm ok living with this issue at the moment. It would just make it that much better if the tabstops worked as expected.
