have several issues with it:\n1. it appears that it at least partially ignores the configuration of the named task in the `tasks.json`. For example, if I have a task `watch:scss` with `\"showOutput\": \"never\"` there - running it manually doesn't invoke new tab with output, but if I also add it to `launch.json` via `\"preLaunchTask\": \"watch:scss\"` - it opens output every time I re/launch the app. However it seems that it does respect the `isWatching` flag, since it doesn't start the app until I terminate the task manually if the setting is false/omitted or it does start the app if the setting is set to true.\n2. if the task is a persistent one (`\"isWatching\": true`) relaunching the app prompts me to terminate the already running one. And it doesn't start the app right away if I chose to terminate it in the prompt - I need to run it again. Which is annoying as hell as you can imagine. There should be an additional setting for either silently restarting the `preLaunchTask` or silently skip the task launch and assuming that the already running should run until the end of the current session. And/or there should be a default based on the either - in any case prompting is not an option.\n3. `preLaunchTask` is hardly present in the documentation at all. I think many more people would complain if they just knew that this option even exist...\n\nthanks in

a JS extension I'm developing using Code version Version 0.10.6 (0.10.6), it is not possible to provide a code action for diagnostic with error code 2304 (cannot find name).
