have a vscode project using TypeScript with tests compiling to the /test path and module source files being output to a /release path. I'm using gulp to generate source maps.\nIf I specify a launch.json configuration with sourceMaps: true and an outDir of 'release' I am able to set breakpoints for the module source files, but breakpoints do not work for the tests.\nIf I remove the outDir path, vscode looks for source maps next to the files and I am able to step through the tests but breakpoints do not work in the module code.\nI've tried compiling the module code to the path containing the source, but vscode only seems to use the first path it finds for source maps.\n\nI would expect vscode to use the outDir path, but fall back to looking for map files next to the source - or better yet, as specified by the sourceMappingURL comment.\n\nInterestingly, if I step from the tests with outDir unspecified, vscode can locate the source maps and step through the module code. It just doesn't stop at the initial breakpoint in the module code unless the outDir property is set.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2702","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2702/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2702/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2702/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/2702","id":131300744,"number":2702,"title":"Use

sure how to title this bug/feature)\n\nPreviously when you had typed a CSS property (e.g. \"motion-path: \" it would display the auto-complete list for all the CSS values after pressing space.\n\nIn the insider build, if you press space nothing happens. It only starts giving completions if you know a character in the value so that it starts matching hits. The previous behaviour was IMO better as it allowed you to see all the hits without looking up what the valid values are, and without having to read documentation to find out what the shortcut is.\n\nAlso, when you press the ctrl+space shortcut after typing the property (e.g. motion-path:[ctrl+space]) it suggests \"no suggestions\" rather than giving the list. So you have to type space then ctrl+space to get the list.\n\nI'm not sure if this behaviour is a regression, or purposely chosen updated behaviour, but I think it is less discoverable now (and personally on Mac I rarely use ctrl shortcuts except for ctrl3 for #)
