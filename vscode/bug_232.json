I found `PPromise` to be a bit clunky to use for a few reasons including (but not limited to):\r\n\r\n- When \"upgrading\" functions to return a PPromise instead of TPromise, it is inconvenient to differentiate between the final result and intermediate progress results. Usually when progress results are sent, you want to ignore the final result, but for backward compatibility with TPromise (if you don't want to make a sweeping change everywhere) you need to return a final result too.\r\n- Non-standard behavior like [this](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/27886/files#diff-9c7cbde8051f3e7fdaf7cdd3765639fbR203) and [this](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/28751/files#diff-4c59e8f28d0ce535d7a6c667deba99a7R219).\r\n\r\nThere is also a [separate discussion](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22318#issuecomment-305569385) regarding cancellation semantics.\r\n\r\n**Proposal**\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if VSCode had a construct that represented a stream of results that could be transformed in a pipeline like fashion.\r\n\r\nIf the VSCode team is agreeable with this idea then there are at least three possible paths forward:\r\n1. Import [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS)\r\n2. Polyfill or copy [ECMAScript's draft spec for Observable](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable/blob/master/src/Observable.js)\r\n3. Implement the bare minimum concept of Observable that would be useful inside of VSCode.\r\n\r\nI would be interested to know the VSCode team's thoughts on (1) the overall idea of having a replacement for PPromise and (2) which path forward would you favor.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28850","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28850/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28850/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28850/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28850","id":236345225,"number":28850,"title":"Terminal Text Highlighted","user":{"login":"jevenson","id":9632520,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9632520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jevenson","html_url":"https://github.com/jevenson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jevenson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jevenson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jevenson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jevenson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jevenson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jevenson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jevenson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jevenson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jevenson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false},{"id":374931321,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"006b75","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2017-06-15T23:57:59Z","updated_at":"2017-09-28T18:44:51Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.13.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nThose who are used to Visual Studio will be disoriented with this behavior. When you're using ctrl + down to move in the file, the cursor position will stay the same even when it goes out of view. So when you press any of the arrow keys after the scroll, the viewport will jarringly jump to the initial cursor's position.\r\n\r\nThe behavior we're used to in Visual Studio will keep the cursor in the viewport whenever possible (the cursor would stick to the first line in the viewport while going down), which I believe is the better behavior. Can't there be at least an option to switch between the 2 behaviors?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28843","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28843/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28843/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28843/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28843","id":236316126,"number":28843,"title":"'Go To Definition' brings up the peek panel, closing it closes the MiniMap","user":{"login":"esimkowitz","id":16651283,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/16651283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/esimkowitz","html_url":"https://github.com/esimkowitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esimkowitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esimkowitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esimkowitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esimkowitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esimkowitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esimkowitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esimkowitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esimkowitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esimkowitz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":543648956,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-minimap","name":"editor-minimap","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-06-15T21:13:21Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T23:43:57Z","closed_at":"2017-06-15T23:43:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.13.1 (379d2efb5539b09112c793d3d9a413017d736f89, 2017-06-14T18:13:05.928Z)\r\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 16.6.0\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|fresh-material|2ndshift|2.2.1|\r\n|vscode-markdownlint|DavidAnson|0.9.1|\r\n|beautify|HookyQR|1.1.1|\r\n|format-php|Kasik96|1.1.2|\r\n|material-icon-theme|PKief|2.0.9|\r\n|code-settings-sync|Shan|2.8.1|\r\n|terminal-tabs|Tyriar|0.1.1|\r\n|html-snippets|abusaidm|0.1.0|\r\n|Bookmarks|alefragnani|0.15.1|\r\n|vscode-color|anseki|0.4.1|\r\n|git-easy|bibhasdn|1.9.1|\r\n|vscode-svgviewer|cssho|1.4.2|\r\n|vscode-eslint|dbaeumer|1.2.11|\r\n|githistory|donjayamanne|0.2.0|\r\n|python|donjayamanne|0.6.5|\r\n|vscode-great-icons|emmanuelbeziat|2.1.7|\r\n|code-runner|formulahendry|0.6.20|\r\n|Go|lukehoban|0.6.62|\r\n|cpptools|ms-vscode|0.11.4|\r\n|csharp|ms-vscode|1.10.0|\r\n|latex|ms-vscode|0.1.3|\r\n|sublime-keybindings|ms-vscode|2.0.1|\r\n|wordcount|ms-vscode|0.1.0|\r\n|debugger-for-chrome|msjsdiag|3.1.4|\r\n|Ruby|rebornix|0.12.1|\r\n|java|redhat|0.5.0|\r\n|pdf|tomoki1207|0.2.0|\r\n|vscode-arduino|vsciot-vscode|0.2.3|\r\n|vscode-todo-highlight|wayou|0.5.5|\r\n|JavaScriptSnippets|xabikos|1.4.0|\r\n|markdown-pdf|yzane|0.1.7|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

And, even if you want to preserve that completion as an option, shouldn't Code default to the second Intellisense hint, the correct completion of `id=\"\"`?\r\n\r\nI would further suggest that tags should not be offered as completions when you're already inside a tag.\r\n\r\n![jun-15-2017 13-44-56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/835148/27194662-6ec5aae2-51d1-11e7-98fa-3d96cc0eb043.gif)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28828","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28828/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28828/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28828/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28828","id":236266488,"number":28828,"title":"Find-all-references preview broken in insiders","user":{"login":"andy-ms","id":19274678,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19274678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-ms","html_url":"https://github.com/andy-ms","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-ms/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-ms/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-ms/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-ms/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-ms/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-ms/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-ms/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-ms/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-ms/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"8D6673","default":true},{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-06-15T17:49:37Z","updated_at":"2017-06-16T08:02:43Z","closed_at":"2017-06-16T08:02:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.14.0-insider\r\n- OS Version: Linux Mint 18\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nType:\r\n```ts\r\nfunction f() {}\r\n// Put a lot of blank lines here.
