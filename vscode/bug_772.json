was reported first by @dbaeumer and I can reproduce: \n\n`vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Hello World!');`\n\nDoes not close automatically after 10 seconds like other messages from the workbench do that are just infos or warnings.\n\nThe reason is that https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/api/node/mainThreadMessageService.ts#L52 always adds a close action to the message even if no other actions are defined. That is not needed, a close action shows up automatically. However, when you pass in actions to message service, it will not automatically close the message assuming that user input is required.\n\nI suggest to check if actions are provided and if so, just show the message like this:\n\n``` typescript\nif (!actions.length) {\n    return this._messageService.show(severity, message);\n}\n```\n\nThis will cause the message to close according to the rules of the workbench message service. Only errors will stay.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12615/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12614","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12614/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12614/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12614/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12614","id":179151538,"number":12614,"title":"Test API'ish way to change configuration settings","user":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307718050,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/testplan-item","name":"testplan-item","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/26","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/26","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/26/labels","id":1944122,"number":26,"title":"September 2016","description":"","creator":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":471,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-16T05:20:24Z","updated_at":"2017-02-21T21:56:29Z","due_on":"2016-09-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-10-14T14:18:36Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-26T06:50:58Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T23:41:28Z","closed_at":"2016-09-27T23:41:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Test for #1396 \n- [x] any os - @Tyriar \n\nComplexity 3\n\nWe added new [API](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L2659) for writing configuration settings.

VSCode Version: 1.5.3 (commit 5be4091987a98e3870d89d630eb87be6d9bafd27)\n- OS Version: Ubuntu Linux 14.04\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Write some code that prints the characters `xA` to the output window.\n2. They are incorrectly turned into a newline.\n\nF# Code:\n\n``` fsharp\nprintfn \"Test - axAb should not print a newline between a and b\"\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nTest - a\nb should not print a newline between a and b\n```\n\nThis has already been reported as #12108, but that bug was incorrectly closed as \"working as designed\" because it was assumed that the code in [`removeAnsiEscapeCodes`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/be5e8d5733c1c012d7e3a6c7e049b59d67c13978/src/vs/base/common/strings.ts#L543) was working as designed. In fact, that code is buggy, and has actually been buggy since [the first commit to VS Code's public repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/8f35cc4768393b25468416829e980d7550619fb1/src/vs/base/common/strings.ts#L579-L579) (I couldn't trace it further back than that). The character sequence `xA` is _not_ the ANSI escape for a linefeed/newline; in fact, [there is no ANSI escape character for a linefeed/newline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code), since ANSI just uses the single character `U+000A` for that purpose. It's pretty clear, looking at the code, that that's what was the `LF` regex was _intended_ to be set to in the lines just above the `removeAnsiEscapeCodes`: it is set to `/\\xA/g`. However, `\\xA` is actually an _invalid_ Javascript hex escape. The [ECMAScript spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#prod-HexEscapeSequence) specifies that `\\x` must be followed by _two_ hex digits, because otherwise the sequences `\\b` (U+0007 BELL) and `\\f` (U+000C FORM FEED) would be ambiguous. So `\\xA` is an invalid sequence, and is instead interpreted by Javascript as the character `x` followed by the character `A` (the backslash is swallowed).\n\nSo the correct fix to bug #12108 is actually to replace that `/\\xA/g` regex with `/\\x0A/g`.\n\nThen one could notice that the code immediately below is replacing all occurrences of `0x0A` with `\\n`, which is a no-op since `\\n` _is_ `0x0A`. So the `LF` regex and the `str = str.replace(LF, '\\n')` line serve no purpose but to slow things down by spending O(N) time doing a no-op regex search. They can safely be removed without affecting any other code, and this would actually speed things up a fraction.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12607","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12607/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12607/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12607/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12607","id":179138835,"number":12607,"title":"Test:
