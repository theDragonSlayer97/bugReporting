We found this by a number of things: \r\n\r\n - For the inspector debug protocol, `process.stdout.write` does not get echod to the debug console, so we switched to integratedTerminal. \r\n - We have some config we set that are endpoints, some of these endpoints have url query params in them, thus the `&`\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Set `bash` as your integrated shell\r\n2. Add the following env to your launch.json for a `node` type project\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"env\": {\r\n    \"foo\": \"bar&bar\",\r\n    \"foo2\": \"hello\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.

When the environment variables are set, vscode does something like this on launch: \r\n\r\n```bash\r\nfoo=bar&bar\r\nfoo2=hello\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIt should be something like\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nfoo=\"bar&bar\"\r\nfoo2=\"hello\"\r\n``` \r\n\r\nOtherwise the `&` is interpreted as a fork operator (for `bash` at-least). This would enable someone to do something like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"env\": { \r\n     \"foo\": \"bar&echo hello world\" \r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28192","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28192/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28192/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28192/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28192","id":234279947,"number":28192,"title":"What's the correct way to asynchronously handle a debugger disconnectRequest?","user":{"login":"DanTup","id":1078012,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1078012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup","html_url":"https://github.com/DanTup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291054922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/debug","name":"debug","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weinand","id":1898161,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1898161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand","html_url":"https://github.com/weinand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-06-07T17:09:31Z","updated_at":"2017-08-18T10:24:00Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm trying to handle the disconnectRequest in my debug adapter.

setting 'editor.formatOnPaste' got changed to true.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is a good idea. It will cause a lot of issues.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the feature builds on format ranges. I've tried to get the HTML formatter to correctly format ranges, but it's a very hard problem as the underlying formatter (jsbeatify) is designed to only format full documents.\r\nUsing it only a subrange doesn't work. Giving it the full content and trying to remove changes outside the range doesn't work, as the changes inside the range are depending on the changes outside (e.g. for indent).\r\nI've come up with some heuristics, but I'm aware that there are many corner cases that will result in strangeness.\r\nWhile I think that's acceptable for a 'format range' comment, where the user picks a range (mostly while lines), and can easily undo, this is too risky to be applied on every paste, by default.\r\nEven in the cases where it kind of works, it is irritating (see #28084).\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend setting the default of editor.formatOnPaste to `false` again. It can be turned on selectively for languages where we know the underlying formatter plays well enough with it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28176/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28175","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28175/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28175/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28175/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28175","id":234152612,"number":28175,"title":"Debugger
