I am using Visual studio code for AngularJS application development. As I am from a .NET development background, I'm much fond of intellisense feature in visual studio code. But I could feel something is missing in this. When I type any Object name, autocomplete box pops up with suggestion, when I select the respective item and press period, the object name is not complete. Example: assume the object name is SampleObject. When I start typing \"Sam\", suggestion pop up lists \"SampleObject\".

from bpasero:**\r\nThe main issue is that our glob patterns are folder based (e.g. exclude `**/node_modules`) and not file based (e.g. exclude `**/node_modules/**`). When we apply the patterns to in-memory editors and editor history we always pass in the full path of the resource and that makes the glob match fail. For search it works because we check the pattern on the parent folders already and return early if they match. The only fix I see for now is to change our default patterns to match on `**/folder/**` instead of `**/folder`.\r\n\r\n**Original**:\r\n\r\nThese steps repro on a node module where the search term is in a sub-directory.

side-by-side diff view of staged & unstaged changes is completely fantastic. I want to use it for all my `git diff` commands. Frequently I'm diffing against something other than `HEAD`, though. For example, I'd like to see the equivalent of `git diff master` in vscode.\n\nI realize that you can set up vscode as a git difftool, but this forces you to view the files one-by-one, rather than en masse. \n\nA way around this would be to support directory diffs. Then I'd be able to run `git difftool --dir-diff` to see all the diffs at once with vscode.\n\nMy `.gitconfig` looks like this:\n\n```\n[difftool \"vscode\"]\n    cmd = code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE\n```\n\nI'm using vscode 1.1.1.\n\nFor comparison, the webdiff project does [something like this](https://github.com/danvk/webdiff/blob/62606f262895ea49005a01b450f0c1d60362ac95/webdiff/gitwebdiff.py) to support running `git webdiff` instead of `git diff` at the command line.
