In the second file, import the first.js file.\r\n\r\nbut intellisense is not showing \"hello\" property. I am able to see the \"world\" property in intellisense menu. Following code is attached.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst first = require(\"./first\");\r\n\r\n//Able to see world property in intellisense menu.\r\nconsole.log(first.world);\r\n\r\n//Not able to see hello property in intellisense menu.\r\nconsole.log(first.hello);\r\n\r\n```\r\n3. Same issue is with Javascript functions as well.\r\n\r\n4. Also while clicking on the \"world\" property in the second file, it can navigate to first file. But it is not working with \"hello\" property.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31706/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31705","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31705/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31705/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31705/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31705","id":246511617,"number":31705,"title":"Javascript intellisence is not correct upon hovering","user":{"login":"Siddharth48","id":26246421,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/26246421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Siddharth48","html_url":"https://github.com/Siddharth48","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Siddharth48/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Siddharth48/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Siddharth48/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Siddharth48/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Siddharth48/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Siddharth48/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Siddharth48/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Siddharth48/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Siddharth48/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-07-29T09:40:57Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T17:23:26Z","closed_at":"2017-08-02T17:23:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.14.2 (cb82febafda0c8c199b9201ad274e25d9a76874e, 2017-07-19T23:34:09.706Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.15063\r\n\r\nWhen I hover over a method or function, it shows he info that is not correct.\r\nFor example, in the given part of node.js code\r\n```\r\nform.parse(req, function (formerror, fields, files) {\r\n```\r\nWhen I hovered over the function paramaters in some of the previous versions of vs code, they showed them more detailed and correct like this on hovering\r\n```\r\nformerror(paramater) : error /* I am sorry if my syntax of displaying the hover is incorrect*/\r\nfields(paramater) : Fields\r\nfiles(paramater) : Files\r\n```\r\nBut in this update and in the previous one, it only shows \"any\" as type on hovering.

Most people needing prefixes would actually use autoprefixer or similar tools in build chain to get that part automated.\r\n\r\n## Benefits?\r\n- Reduces the maintenance on the language-server side.\r\n- Encourages use of standard properties and using a tool to get prefixes when needed.\r\n- Reduces the amount of options shown in the intellisense list so it's easier to navigate and provides better UX.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nHere the list shows `-ms-` and `-webkit-` prefixed version of values even before the standard value comes in.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/313363/28743309-9b724da6-7464-11e7-8b54-699c3ac8ed56.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31701","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31701/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31701/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31701/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31701","id":246508093,"number":31701,"title":"Error: No such module: atom_renderer_v8_util","user":{"login":"yuankeyang","id":9057983,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9057983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuankeyang","html_url":"https://github.com/yuankeyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuankeyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuankeyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuankeyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuankeyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuankeyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuankeyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuankeyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuankeyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuankeyang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-29T08:18:33Z","updated_at":"2017-07-31T15:37:49Z","closed_at":"2017-07-31T15:37:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

PR fixes a bug with terminal process name detection on Windows when an external console is launched with the `start` command.\r\n\r\nIt takes advantage of the fact that any console in a new window will have a child process of `conhost.exe`.\r\nWhile going through the child process tree, if a process with a name of `conhost.exe` is detected, the shell two levels up will be re-examined for other child processes.\r\n\r\nBecause this requires travelling back up to the shell from which the external console was launched, child processes are cached while traversing the tree.\r\n\r\nBelow is a gif of VS Code with the changes on the left and the current version on the right:\r\n\r\n![2017-07-28_23-21-31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18223213/28743077-ac9548b4-73f5-11e7-9450-04df9a70a546.gif)\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that at the end of the gif, the name takes a while to change. This is because with two external shells, the traversal is like this (tree below):\r\n\r\n```\r\n|___ powershell.exe\r\n| |___ cmd.exe\r\n| | |___ conhost.exe\r\n| |___ bash.exe\r\n| | |___ conhost.exe\r\n| |___ cmd.exe\r\n```\r\n\r\nGo to `powershell.exe`, query child processes, go to `cmd.exe`, query child processes, go to `conhost.exe`, go back to `powershell.exe`, query child processes, go to `bash.exe`, query child processes, go to `conhost.exe`, go back to `powershell.exe`, use cached child processes, go to `cmd.exe`, query child processes, return with `cmd.exe` -\r\n every single time a terminal title update is requested.\r\n\r\nThis is a lot of queries. One option to fix this would be to save the pids of the external consoles. However I don't know how Windows recycles pids, and this might flag other perfectly good processes as externally launched.

Do you have a question?

Open apparently corrupted folder\r\n2. See that ctrl+space leads to eternal \"loading\" and that alt-p -> run tasks -> will just sit loading possible tasks forever\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\nThe way I worked around this problem is that I copied my entire folder into a new location and then opened the new location and VS Code works like a champ.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I really did repo this with --disable-extensions. Even with --disable-extensions submitted the 'corrupt' location won't work and the new one will in terms of things like intellisense.\r\n\r\nWhat appears to be happening is that during our tests we create a directory test/testRoot and in there are actual Node projects which contain node_modules which contain a reference to the project we are developing. Now, not being completely stupid, I early on added testRoot as an entry to tesconfig.json/exclude. But somehow VS Code is still \"seeing\" testRoot and especially when I use npm link (which presumably creates a loop from the project entry in node_modules in testRoot back to the production project) things break. What I have done is added include to our tsconfig.json and specify our src and test directory and I have hoisted testRoot out of the test directory and made it its own directory (it has, btw, always been in .gitignore). So far that seems to have fixed the issue.\r\n\r\nSo the bug seems to be that even though the testRoot directory was in tsconfig.json/exclude, in some way VS Code appears to be 'seeing' it, even if possibly just enumerating directory contents and that causes it to fail somehow. But why was it looking in that directory at all when it was on the exclude list?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31692","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31692/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31692/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31692/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31692","id":246485335,"number":31692,"title":"TypeScript formatter -- insertSpaceBeforeFunctionParenthesis -- fails when generic arguments are present","user":{"login":"axefrog","id":298883,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/298883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog","html_url":"https://github.com/axefrog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axefrog/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":451222386,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/format","name":"format","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":291124272,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/javascript","name":"javascript","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":286886536,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-29T00:10:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-31T16:03:22Z","closed_at":"2017-07-31T16:02:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?
