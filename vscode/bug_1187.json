the 0.10.1 update, typing anything in the editor is very laggy: characters appear with about 0.5 seconds delay and almost never in the same order I actually typed them on the keyboard.\n\nPossibly related: scrolling to the top of a file in the editor triggers a slower top-down refresh of the contents that apper in the editor. I actually see how the code is refreshed like in a bitmap, line by line, pixel-wise.\n\nI'm using Ubuntu Linux 15.10.

Why are function names like `main()` and `do_stuff()` **yellow**, while their use **orange**?\n4. Why are class names like `Foo` and namespace names like `space` using keyword **blue** colour?\n## For Reference\n\nVSCode 0.9 and below (it was simpler but at least it was

Github use .h for their header files and not **.hpp**, **.hh**, or **.hxx**. Even Microsoft-shipped C++ include headers are all **.h**.\n\nSince I cannot change the extensions of my files in any reasonably mature C++ project, I'm left with either modifying the VS Code root installation cpp extension or manually change the syntax highlighting to C++ every time I open a **.h** file. Both of these solutions are not ideal, especially since this was NOT a problem in earlier versions of VS Code.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/144","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/144/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/144/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/144/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/144","id":117745166,"number":144,"title":"TextEdit[] returned from provideDocumentFormattingEdits doesn't behave correctly?","user":{"login":"lukehoban","id":223467,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/223467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehoban","html_url":"https://github.com/lukehoban","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehoban/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehoban/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehoban/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehoban/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehoban/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehoban/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehoban/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehoban/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukehoban/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":287991608,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/important","name":"important","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":291057332,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/verified","name":"verified","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"egamma","id":172399,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/172399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma","html_url":"https://github.com/egamma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"egamma","id":172399,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/172399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma","html_url":"https://github.com/egamma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egamma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/9","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/9","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/9/labels","id":1414257,"number":9,"title":"Nov 2015 -

It seems that in some cases Code will corrupt the buffer in odd but deterministic ways.  \n\nI haven't been able to pin down the exact incorrect behaviour, but two example:\n\n_Example 1_\nBefore text: \n\n```\npackage caddy\\n\\nfunc main() {\\n\\tfmt.Println(\"Hello World! :)\")\\n}\\n\n```\n\nThen replace the full range with:\n\n```\npackage caddy\\n\\nimport \"fmt\"\\n\\nfunc main() {\\n\\tfmt.Println(\"Hello World! :)\")\\n}\\n\n```\n\nThe result will be \n\n```\npackage caddyimport \"fmt\"func main() {\\n\\tfmt.Println(\"Hello World! :)\")\\n}\\n\n```\n\n_Example 2_\nBefore text: \n\n```\npackage caddy\\n\\nfunc main() {\\n    fmt.Println(\"Hello World! :)\")\\n}\\n\n```\n\nThen replace the full range with:\n\n```\npackage caddy\\n\\nimport \"fmt\"\\n\\nfunc main() {\\n\\tfmt.Println(\"Hello World! :)\")\\n}\\n\n```\n\nThe result will be \n\n```\npackage caddy\\n\\nimport \"fmt\"\\n\\nfunc main() {\\n\\tfmt.Println(\"Hello World! :)\")\\n}\\n\n```\n\nNote that the only difference between these examples is the `\"\\t\"` vs `\"    \"` in the original text.  The result in Example 1 has corruption in the string result in a seemingly random location.\n\nTwo question:\n1. Is this a bug in the extension API, or am I somehow calling it wrong?\n2. If it's a bug, is there any workaround?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/143","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/143/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/143/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/143/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/143","id":117735786,"number":143,"title":"Request
