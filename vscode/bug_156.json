looked at the multi-root workspace implementation and noticed that the internal API differentiates between a \"single-folder workspace\" (an opened folder) and a \"multi-folder workspace\" (a workspace with possibly multiple roots that can be persisted to a file). Depending on the kind of workspace, different code paths are taken in multiple places.\r\n\r\nWhen a user has a folder open and wants to add a second one, he is prompted with this dialog:\r\n\r\n![Upgrade Workspace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/900690/28367923-f06008be-6c92-11e7-8c53-bd07f0a7cc56.png)\r\n\r\nThis makes the UX heavier than in e.g. Sublime, where you can just open a single folder, then drag-and-drop other folders to add them to the workspace without having to reload.\r\n\r\nNew \"multi-folder\" workspace already don't need to be explicitely saved in VS Code, there is a concept of an untitled workspace and VS Code is able to restore even untitled workspaces from a previous session.\r\n\r\nI am wondering whether it would be easier to not differentiate between \"single-folder\" and \"multi-folder\", but let single-folder just be an untitled workspace with a single folder in it. That way\r\n- a user could add more folders without having to \"upgrade\" the workspace and reload\r\n- the internal API becomes a lot simpler (smaller bug area, e.g. #31142)\r\n\r\nUsers who don't want to use multi-folder workspaces would not notice the change. The single folder would always be opened in the \"default\" untitled workspace. File -> Open Folder would just replace the `roots` array with a new array that only contains the new folder. This would also provide the ability to change folders completely without reloading the window once extensions handle the `onDidChangeWorkspaceRoots` event.\r\n\r\nWould love to hear your thoughts!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31147/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31146","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31146/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31146/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31146/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31146","id":244428217,"number":31146,"title":"Settings

Steps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a script to a `package.json` file or add a npm task to `tasks.json` with or without an identifier.\r\n2.
