VSCode Version: 1.13.0\r\n- OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n\r\nWhen word wrapping is enabled, the editor should only break lines at space characters.  (More precisely, I suppose it should break lines at any of the Unicode space characters which are not specifically designated as non-breaking.)  Unfortunately at the moment it also breaks lines between alphabetic characters and adjacent Unicode quotes.  For example, it will not break **don't** because it only contains an ASCII quote.  However, it will break **don’t** because it contains U+2019, the right single quotation mark.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Turn on word wrap in a buffer, with the \"editor.wordWrap\" configuration option.\r\n2. Enter a word with a Unicode quote, for example by copying **don’t** from the paragraph above.\r\n3. Enter more text to the left of the word **don’t** until it wraps.\r\n4. Observe that it first wraps by moving the **t** onto the next line, leaving the rest of the word behind.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28426","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28426/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28426/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28426/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28426","id":235009386,"number":28426,"title":"NPM module autocomplete (Mocha) turns on only after creating a jsconfig.json file","user":{"login":"stoberov","id":5932031,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5932031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoberov","html_url":"https://github.com/stoberov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoberov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoberov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoberov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoberov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoberov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoberov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoberov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoberov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoberov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-10T15:34:32Z","updated_at":"2017-06-13T00:46:24Z","closed_at":"2017-06-13T00:46:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey,\r\n\r\nI've noticed some odd behavior whilst using **mocha** inside a React app. In fact, I've noticed this on other modules, too, but I'm providing the **mocha** example here.\r\n\r\nInitially, some modules (mocha) do not provide any intellisense.

Haxe extension, I noticed that the explorer sometimes crashed (not displaying any content until VSCode is reloaded). This seems to happen whenever an extension with a tree view is activated while the explorer hasn't been shown yet.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Check out and build the [tree-view-sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/tree-view-sample) extension.\r\n2. Add `*` to the `package.json`'s `activationEvents`.\r\n3. Select \"Launch Extension\" in the Debug menu.\r\n4. Expand one of the contributed tree views.\r\n4. Switch to any view other than the Explorer (Search, Debug, ...).\r\n5. <kbd>F1</kbd> -> Reload Window\r\n6. Switch back to the Explorer - it doesn't display anything, and there's an exception in the dev console:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<pre><code>Cannot read property 'setActions' of undefined: TypeError: Cannot

VSCode Version: 1.13.0\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 x64 v1703 build 10.0.15063\r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Use `AutoHotKey` v1.1.24.5 to map Right Alt Key `RAlt` to the MenuKey:\r\n``` ahk\r\nRAlt:: Send {Appskey}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. This hotkey works well on Windows Explorer, Notepad, Microsoft Word, Chrome, Notepad++. Software's context menu is showing when Right Alt key is released (keyup).\r\n\r\n3.  This hotkey **usually fails to work** on VSCode:\r\n- 1. VSCode shows its context menu (which seems to be correct)\r\n- 2. press 'ArrowDown' to select the `Shift+F12` (search all references), and then press Enter\r\n- 3. then VSCode **shows the same context menu again**, which is not expected\r\n      (although sometimes it shows reference view correctlly)\r\n- 4. repeat action 2\r\n- 5. **sometimes VSCode shows a \"plain\" context menu** only including cut/copy/paste/delete, or it just hides the second context menu\r\n- 6. if step 5 shows a plain menu, then `Esc` will close it.\r\n- during step 4, if you press `Esc` instead, VSCode may hide the menu and show what I want.\r\n\r\n4. This problem seems to happen depending what action runs firstly, and if you fail to reproduce it, please close VSCode completely and re-run it for several times, or you may repeat step 1-3 again and again. I'm sure this is a bug and I've met it for days.\r\n\r\n# What's in Developer Tools:\r\n\r\nVSCode and Chrome both gets such events: `keyup.Alt`, `keydown.ContextMenu`, `keyup.ContextMenu`, but **VSCode shows context menu at once on `keydown.ContextMenu`**. In my tests, many common softwares including Notepad, Explorer, Word, will show a context menu only on a `keyup` event.\r\n\r\nI've tested the newest `Electron` demo application (Win x64, downloaded from https://electron.atom.io/), and it also responds only to `keyup`. So I think VSCode should change this behavior to keep the same as others.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28414","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28414/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28414/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28414/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28414","id":234993388,"number":28414,"title":"OSX shell directory is appearing twice in Integrated Terminal","user":{"login":"vikas027","id":6998650,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6998650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikas027","html_url":"https://github.com/vikas027","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikas027/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikas027/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikas027/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikas027/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikas027/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikas027/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikas027/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikas027/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikas027/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-06-10T10:06:46Z","updated_at":"2017-06-13T12:28:36Z","closed_at":"2017-06-12T17:13:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Versions\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.13.0\r\n- OS X Version: 10.11.2\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nCurrent working directory is appearing twice in after upgrading to 1.13.0.

is a feature request for a new user interface component which is responsible for showing and interacting with Suggestions and Hints.\r\n\r\nCurrently, a user has two options for interacting with Suggestions and Hints: have them pop-up automatically as they type, or to trigger them manually with a keystroke (excepting a [bug](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28393) for Hints).\r\n\r\nThere are problems with both approaches, and I believe there could be a happy compromise between the two. First, the simple problem with *manual* triggering is that it takes extra effort to get the information that a programmer wants. Ask anyone who relies a lot on auto-suggestions or hints and they will tell you how useful it can be to *always* have this information on their screen, with no extra effort on their part.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are problems with the auto-suggestions:\r\n\r\n* At the most basic level, they can be visually distracting with constant movement in a variable part of the screen\r\n* They can cover up other code that you'd like to be able to see while you're typing\r\n* They also often take control of various keyboard inputs, though in most cases this can be disabled.\r\n\r\nI think it would be great to have a panel (say, taking up a portion of the left sidebar, at the bottom, underneath the Explorer/Search/SCM/etc content), which stays in a fixed position on the screen and displays this context-aware information, without covering up any of the Editor.\r\n\r\nThis feature request is filed due to my own interest and the recommendation of @mjbvz at https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28380#issuecomment-307544736.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28409","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28409/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28409/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28409/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28409","id":234982973,"number":28409,"title":"Add \"line_padding_bottom\", \"line_padding_top\" like sublime text","user":{"login":"pixieaka","id":17777237,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17777237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixieaka","html_url":"https://github.com/pixieaka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixieaka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixieaka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixieaka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixieaka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixieaka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixieaka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixieaka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixieaka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pixieaka/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":425577013,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor-core","name":"editor-core","color":"c5def5","default":false},{"id":272689392,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/feature-request","name":"feature-request","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/8/labels","id":1412124,"number":8,"title":"Backlog","description":"Work not yet planned for a specific release.","creator":{"login":"chrisdias","id":1487073,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1487073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2719,"closed_issues":2387,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-11-15T10:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:24:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-10T06:01:10Z","updated_at":"2017-08-11T02:51:49Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"\"Line height\" property In Code is make cursor indicator bigger ,, In Sublime Text\r\n{\"line_padding_bottom\", \"line_padding_top\" } is much better actually\r\n\r\nAll the best ...
