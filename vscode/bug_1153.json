https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostLanguageFeatureCommands.ts#L55 to retrieve the same list of completions the UI would show.\n\nIt would be great to know where the CompletionItem is pointing to (which file and which line number) if available locally of course.\nThis could help extensions to display a function, or to go to that function, or to analyse the function to add more info for example when available ...\n\nIt could apply to provideHover, so when the text is hovered one can add info regarding the function pointed with an extension.\n\nI hope this could help others.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1165","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1165/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1165/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1165/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/1165","id":121452440,"number":1165,"title":"Joh/commands
