cool how the in-box themes are able to change the colors of the UI surrounding the editor control.

It would be up to the author of the theme package to choose which keys/colors to use for the UI element colors.

@alefragnani on November 18, 2015 1:38_\n\nI would like to replicate the behavior of **Go to Symbol** command, where I give a list if items and the user can use UP/DOWN keys to navigate between them. Each now focused item, it scrolls the editor to the position where that piece of code is located. My intention is to use the _line number_ to navigate.\n\nI was thinking to use `vscode.window.showQuickPick`, but didn' find how to do this (no event, for instance).\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n_Copied
