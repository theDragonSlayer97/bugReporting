It's great that the new setting (\"window.newWindowDimensions\": \"inherit\") was added to preserve the window size.\r\n\r\nBut, the new window overlaps exactly on the existing window. It might be a little bit confusing. A user may think that the previous window was closed. Or, was replaced by a new one. I think it should follow the behavior of widely used applications such as Windows Explorer or Firefox, both of which cascade the new window a little bit so as to differentiate it with the previous one.\r\n\r\nProbably a new configuration setting such as, \"window.newWindowPosition\" with options, \"same\" and \"cascade\" could be added.\r\n\r\nIt's a feature request.

VSCode Version: 1.9.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 (Version 1511, Build 10586.545)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open VS Code.\r\n2. From File menu, select \"Open File\" (or \"Open Folder\", or \"Save As\").\r\n3. Try to create a new folder by clicking \"New Folder\".\r\n4. The new folder does not show up.\r\n5. Press F5 to refresh.\r\n6. The new folder shows up.\r\n7. Now, try to rename the folder.\r\n8. When you hit enter after renaming the folder, it still shows as \"New Folder\".\r\n9. Hit F5.\r\n10. Now, it shows as the renamed folder.\r\n\r\nIt may be a bug in the common library being used for development for Microsoft products. I verified using Firefox and Notepad. In Firefox, the behavior is alright. I can create new folder and rename it without having to refresh. But, in Notepad, the above mentioned issue is present.\r\n\r\nProbably, the developers/maintainers of this project know best where to forward this issue in case it needs to be fixed by some other team at Microsoft.\r\n\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21543","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21543/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21543/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21543/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21543","id":210705366,"number":21543,"title":"Show

For example, in my settings:\r\n```json\r\n  // Controls the wrapping column of the editor when `editor.wordWrap` is 'wordWrapColumn' or 'bounded'.\r\n  \"editor.wordWrapColumn\": 80,\r\n\r\n  // Width to word-wrap to when using gq.\r\n  \"vim.textwidth\": 80,\r\n```\r\nI want to keep the values of both the variables consistent. It would be nice to have something like:\r\n```json\r\n\"vim.textwidth\": @\"editor.wordWrapColumn\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure if JSON has a standard way of referencing previous objects, but this would be a nice feature to have at least within VS Code. YAML doesn't support referencing directly either, but at least you can define node anchors and then reference them later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21533","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21533/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21533/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21533/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21533","id":210676482,"number":21533,"title":"firstLine

Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: \r\n```\r\nVersion 1.9.1\r\nCommit f9d0c687ff2ea7aabd85fb9a43129117c0ecf519\r\nDate 2017-02-09T00:26:45.394Z\r\nShell 1.4.6\r\nRenderer 53.0.2785.143\r\nNode 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n- OS Version:\r\nWin 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI am using the C# extension to reproduce this, but it should be visible from any debug adapter.\r\n\r\n1. Use the C# Extension to debug a .NET Core console app with the following code:\r\n```cs\r\nusing System;\r\n\r\nnamespace ConsoleApplication\r\n{\r\n    public class Program\r\n    {\r\n        public static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            int i=1;\r\n            i++;\r\n        } // BP Here\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Turn on debugger logging by adding the following block to launch.json launch configuration:\r\n```\r\n            \"logging\": {\r\n                \"traceResponse\": true\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n3. Set a breakpoint on the line indicated and start debugging\r\n4. View the debug console to see tracing output\r\n5. Evaluate `i++` in the Watch area\r\n\r\nExpected: `i++` shows 2 in the watch expression (it is post decrement so it should return 2)\r\nActual: `i++` shows 3 in the watch expression, because it is being evaluated twice\r\n\r\nThis is also shown in the debugger log output:\r\n```\r\nC evaluate: {\"expression\":\"i++\",\"frameId\":1000,\"context\":\"watch\"}\r\n R: {\"success\":true,\"message\":null,\"request_seq\":12,\"command\":\"evaluate\",\"body\":{\"result\":\"2\",\"variablesReference\":0,\"type\":\"int\"},\"running\":false,\"refs\":null,\"seq\":0,\"type\":\"response\"}\r\nC evaluate: {\"expression\":\"i++\",\"frameId\":1000,\"context\":\"watch\"}\r\n R: {\"success\":true,\"message\":null,\"request_seq\":13,\"command\":\"evaluate\",\"body\":{\"result\":\"3\",\"variablesReference\":0,\"type\":\"int\"},\"running\":false,\"refs\":null,\"seq\":0,\"type\":\"response\"}\r\nC
