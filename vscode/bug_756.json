This is a real problem as you can imagine.  All of the sudden my code/servers just crash because vscode replaced chunks of code it wasn't supposed to.  What's worse is it doesn't always change the entire file, sometimes just parts of it are changed which means time wasted on debugging.  Usually Ctrl z can reverse this pretty quickly but the file changes are very disturbing.
