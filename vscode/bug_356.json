This is too small. As in the comment in that line, showing images may consume too much resources. However, if resource is not a problem (e.g., 32 core and 512G mem), could it able to utilize these resources to show large size images (e.g., a 20M gif)?\r\n\r\nSo this is a feature request. A configurable ``MAX_IMAGE_SIZE`` is great.

discovered with [Python debugger extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python). Usually, it passes `debugOptions` array to its python counterpart `visualstudio_py_launcher.py` from `launch.json`, joined with comma, like so:\r\n\r\n**launch.json**:\r\n`\"debugOptions\": [\"WaitOnAbnormalExit\",\"WaitOnNormalExit\"]`\r\n\r\n**launch command**:\r\n\r\n> python C:\\Users\\...\\.vscode\\extensions\\donjayamanne.python-0.6.3\\pythonFiles\\PythonTools\\visualstudio_py_launcher.py working_dir 51686 34806ad9-833a-45248cd6-18ca4aa74f14 **WaitOnAbnormalExit,WaitOnNormalExit** file.py\r\n\r\n However, when `debugOptions` is empty, no argument is passed. As `visualstudio_py_launcher.py` relies on position of its arguments, it breaks, as `file.py` is now taking place of `debugOptions`.\r\n\r\nI tracked this issue to `TerminalSupport.prepareCommand` not properly escaping empty argument: it should pass `\"\"` instead of empty string for it.\r\n\r\nWith this fix, launch command for empty `debugOptions` looks like:\r\n\r\n> python C:\\Users\\...\\.vscode\\extensions\\donjayamanne.python-0.6.3\\pythonFiles\\PythonTools\\visualstudio_py_launcher.py working_dir 51686 34806ad9-833a-45248cd6-18ca4aa74f14 **\"\"** file.py\r\n\r\nand successfully works.\r\n\r\nTested only with `cmd.exe`, but in my understanding should be the same for other shells, so I changed that too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25097","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25097/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25097/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25097/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25097","id":223194406,"number":25097,"title":"Treat

VSCode Version: 1.11.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 Anniversary Update\r\n\r\nThe bug I'm experiencing has two parts:\r\n1. When moving down using the down commands (vim `j` in normal mode, or keyboard down arrow in insert mode), the cursor is moved to the end of the line (the fold marker) for lines which have a fold.\r\n2. When the cursor is left on a fold marker for longer than a few hundred milliseconds, the fold expands.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Create a fold\r\n2. Starting from the top line of the fold, move the cursor down with the keyboard (I moved it down twice in the gifs)\r\n\r\n## Expected Result\r\nThe cursor treats folded lines as it treats any other lines (you can move up, down over a folded group as though they were all a single line)\r\n\r\nHere's the expected behavior, in atom (I apologize for my poor gif quality):\r\n![atom fold](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3342777/25251472/19d5e9ca-25df-11e7-8c19-f0b0d4fcb121.gif)\r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\nHitting down moves the cursor to the end of the line, atop the fold indicator.\r\nThe fold expands.\r\n\r\nHere's the actual behavior, in VS Code:\r\n![fold](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3342777/25251488/248452da-25df-11e7-9549-f455cb27281d.gif)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nI'm using the vim extension in VS Code and vim-mode-plus in Atom. In both cases, it doesn't matter whether I use `j` or `down arrow`.\r\nI'd love to see a setting to disable the auto fold expansion, assuming it's working as designed. I'd much rather toggle the fold myself with a keybinding.\r\nI'd also love to see a toggle fold command. It appears VS Code only has expand and collapse commands.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4196","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"9E68:366F:C577D2:1812D3C:59D9375B","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=357>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=355>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"e537011055f1b395c32e8a6a47c7f293\"","status":"200 OK"}}
