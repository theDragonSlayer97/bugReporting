VSCode Version: `Version 1.5.0-insider (1.5.0-insider)` 1de4d832ccb061c13cf70eaf0221fbaa86abfbdd\n- OS Version: `OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.6 (15G31)`\n\nI'm working on a new extension to provide CodeLens for Git across most supported vscode languages (assuming they implement a DocumentSymbolProvider. But I've run into a few bugs as well as API (and UI) limitations.\n\nYou can find my [GitLens](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens) extension on GitHub with the latest release [here](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens/releases/tag/0.0.3). I haven't yet wanted to publish it to the marketplace until I get some of these issues resolved.\n\nHere are a couple of screenshots to give you an idea of the UI:\n\nProvides CodeLens with the author and date of the last check-in.\n\n> ![CodeLens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eamodio/vscode-git-codelens/master/images/preview-codelens.png)\n\nClicking on a CodeLens opens a blame \"explorer\" with the commits and changed lines in the right pane and the commit (file) contents on the left.\n\n> ![Blame Explorer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eamodio/vscode-git-codelens/master/images/preview-blame.png)\n\nLet me first say that I know I am really stretching the limits (read: hijacking) the reference UI, but I think it does come pretty close to something pretty cool for this.\n\nThe first biggest issue I've been running into is using a `TextDocumentContentProvider` to provide the content for a reference location url seems to time out after a minute or so -- seems like it is getting garbage collection, but I'm not sure how to stop that.\n\nNext issue is I would like to provide decorators (blame line indication) for the content provided by my `TextDocumentContentProvider`. I've been able to hack this the first time the my [GitBlameContentProvider](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens/blob/master/src/gitBlameContentProvider.ts) is loaded for a particular uri, but once it is cached there doesn't seem to be any published event that I can trap to trigger a decoration. It would be really nice if there was an even when a reference was selected in the reference UI. It would also be great if there was a way to officially find a particular uri in the visible set of editors -- right now I have this[ awful hack](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens/blob/master/src/gitBlameContentProvider.ts#L75).\n\nI would also love to be able to control the order (and initial selection) of locations provided to the reference UI -- right now they are sorted alphabetically, so I am resorting to crafting my uris with an [embedded index](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens/blob/master/src/gitProvider.ts#L140) -- which is less than ideal. Also the initial selection of the reference UI seems to be the location closest to the trigger point in the document, but I would love to be able to control that -- even for real references it is arguable if that is ideal.\n\nI thought I was also seeing race conditions with the Omnisharp-vscode extension, where the C# `DocumentSymbolProvider` wouldn't respond when my CodeLens would try to execute `vscode.executeDocumentSymbolProvider`. I haven't been able to really reproduce this lately, so it could be gone now.\n\nThank you for the awesome product that vscode is and I would greatly appreciate any help or guidance on these issues!\n\nThanks,\nEric Amodio\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11359","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11359/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11359/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11359/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11359","id":174416137,"number":11359,"title":"Keyboard word selection does not include the space and is inconsistent with other editors","user":{"login":"landofjoe","id":3289513,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3289513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/landofjoe","html_url":"https://github.com/landofjoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landofjoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landofjoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landofjoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landofjoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landofjoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landofjoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landofjoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landofjoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landofjoe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":294817667,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/editor","name":"editor","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-01T01:26:55Z","updated_at":"2017-04-11T13:54:22Z","closed_at":"2017-04-11T13:54:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: any\n- OS Version: Windows\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

Here are some of my initial thoughts:\n- The _actual_ selection should _always_ be the selection color defined in the theme - this is the primary reason I sometimes lost my selection.\n- Find matches should _not_ use the selection color defined by the theme.\n- Some of these states have colors that differ by so little they lose information and make the UI look sloppy. We should reduce the number of possible colors by reducing the amount they can stack with each other.\n- Is it useful differentiating symbol highlight and selection highlight?\n- Is strong symbol highlight useful? We already have a color to indicate symbols and they can't both show at once.\n  - I'm quite perplexed by it, especially when things like this happen:\n    \n    ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2193314/18150034/ef49b940-6f98-11e6-8b92-760f40dd5c4d.png)\n    \n    Why are both `userEnv` variables highlighted with the strong symbol highlight below but not above?\n    \n    ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2193314/18150039/fd69d172-6f98-11e6-83f4-b495607ae9ca.png)\n  - The blue looks bad in my theme, is there a way we can get a more suitable color using existing colors?\n- The line highlight color doesn't work when a range is selected.\n- Can we use a border to indicate find matches or something? That would make the distinction very clear.\n- Since 95% of themes are just imported from Sublime `.tmTheme` files and not adjusted to work better with vscode, we should make an effort to have the defaults work and only add additional tmTheme properties if they are absolutely necessary.\n- `findHighlight` is defined in many themes, why don't we adopt that since Sublime uses it?\n\nPersonally I think something like below would be more usable despite being so simple (this is to illustrate my point, I'm not proposing this):\n- Selection is always the `selection` color from theme\n- All symbol and word highlights are `selection` color at 50% opacity\n- Find matches use white with 50% opacity\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11354/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11353","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11353/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11353/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11353/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11353","id":174404991,"number":11353,"title":"\"More
