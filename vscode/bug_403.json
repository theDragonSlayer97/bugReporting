VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 1607\r\n\r\nVSCode is forcing the wrong version of `npm` to be used within git integration, linting pre-commit hooks.

App@1.1.0 pretest: `npm run lint`\r\nnpm ERR! Exit status 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI have a package.json that uses ghooks configured like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"config\": {\r\n    \"ghooks\": {\r\n      \"pre-commit\": \"npm run lint\",\r\n      \"pre-push\": \"npm run test\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though my npm is updated generally, VSCode seems to be forcing the use of the wrong version of npm, though powershell, dev cmd, and cmd all resolve the correct one.  I'm sure this test case can be simplified, but actually I couldn't think of how.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17498172/24527343/ab43231c-156f-11e7-9f6c-b7c23e8136ef.png)\r\n\r\nI don't recognize any relevant user or workspace settings for this problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23700","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23700/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23700/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23700/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23700","id":218303488,"number":23700,"title":"Word Wrap state is lost after switching tabs","user":{"login":"freMea","id":22337329,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/22337329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/freMea","html_url":"https://github.com/freMea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freMea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freMea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freMea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freMea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freMea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freMea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freMea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freMea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freMea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexandrudima","id":5047891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5047891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima","html_url":"https://github.com/alexandrudima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexandrudima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-30T19:30:30Z","updated_at":"2017-03-31T07:59:02Z","closed_at":"2017-03-31T07:58:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: Win 10 x64 pro\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

Using symbol search palette doesn't necessarily give what you need. Please help us improving that and speed up the process.\r\n\r\nThe best way I see to resolve this issue is to organize your code with comment section to be able to quickly jump through ToC items.\r\n\r\nIn _Sublime Text_ there is an extension named [Table of Comments](https://github.com/kizza/Table-of-comments).\r\n\r\n![Image](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/dbb8910ec51af12b0874103c8b61a07628962930/687474703a2f2f696d6775722e636f6d2f754968735138412e676966)\r\n\r\nYou just need to add a heading line in your comment with a special prefix symbol and it will be considered as a new ToC entry. For each new special heading you add in comments in your file, the ToC summary at the top is updated showing all available entries.\r\n\r\nBut the best is the ability to show a ToC menu in palette presented as a tree of headings entries.\r\n\r\nPlease add such a feature and make the ToC tree available in a new code panel like asked in #5605","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23698/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23697","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23697/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23697/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23697/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/23697","id":218298308,"number":23697,"title":"Can I extend / merge language gammars?","user":{"login":"eppz","id":1779614,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1779614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppz","html_url":"https://github.com/eppz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-03-30T19:09:51Z","updated_at":"2017-04-05T02:48:45Z","closed_at":"2017-03-30T19:43:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm making a C# theme, now I want to add some framework dependent keyword scopes (that I can color later on).\r\n\r\nIs there a way to **extend the default [`csharp.tmLanguage`](https://github.com/dotnet/csharp-tmLanguage)** with some additional rule?
