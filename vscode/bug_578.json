Although this might be useful for some clients I think the majority is not interested in ANSI Control characters since the interpretation is not easy. I therefore suggest that the terminal provide two different listeners.

Closed Every single thing on my PC like Plank, Spotify and Background Processes like Redis Server, Mongo Server etc. \r\n3.

starts rotating at fairly high speeds(Don't have the exact numbers, But it's faster than usual). \r\n\r\nI don't know how to check this, but I am certain that Vscode is probably using a lot of GPU

Generally, this is a good thing, especially for newer users that don't want to configure too much or do not have too strong feelings about their shortcuts or as an easy way to recommend a shortcut that makes sense.\r\n\r\nAs an advanced user with **very** strong own opinions what my keyboard should do I have to reconfigure a lot of them. Usually that's not a problem, setting shortcuts is straight forward. But from time to time other default VSCode shortcuts are overwritten that I want to keep, so I have to unbind the extensions default first and set my own afterwards – sometimes for multiple commands per extension.\r\n\r\nThis process bloats the settings file and raises its complexity, I'm already at 300 lines after using VSCode for only a couple of months.\r\n\r\n## From an extension developer perspective\r\n\r\nWhen building my own extensions, I am aware of my own pain point above. On one hand, I want to provide my own opinionated shortcuts and set defaults, so that new users don't have to configure them or figure out what works. After all, great user experience matters and the simple one-click-install of extensions is exactly that.\r\n\r\nBut I also don't want to pollute the settings of other advanced users. And I'm fully aware that some of my opinions only make sense with my own setup, so it is quite hard too even come up with a sane and useful default that works for everyone. Should I rather set no default shortcut at all to please the advanced user group more? Hmmm…\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nI thought a lot about it, and the only viable solution I could come up with is introducing a setting to ignore / skip preset shortcuts from extensions. The current default behaviour (extensions can set defaults) should be kept.\r\n\r\n## TL;DR\r\n\r\nA setting like `\"extensions.ignoreContributedKeybindings\": false` solves 2 problems at once.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18441/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18440","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18440/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18440/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18440/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18440","id":200323584,"number":18440,"title":"`ext install <extension name>` not working","user":{"login":"kumarharsh","id":760112,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/760112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh","html_url":"https://github.com/kumarharsh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":386618042,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-01-12T09:58:47Z","updated_at":"2017-01-12T15:02:55Z","closed_at":"2017-01-12T14:20:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.9.0-insider\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
