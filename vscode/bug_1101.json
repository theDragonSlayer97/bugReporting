are quiet some extensions out there to handle setting synchronization between multiple computers. And in my opinion they are very important: Since vscode is very customizable with settings, keyboardshortcuts and extension it is very hard to synchronize those things between multiple workstations. And all those extensions are not really clean solutions, because vscode does nearly nothing to support them (for example the paths vscode uses are not exposed, see #2741).\n\nSo here some ideas to make synchronization clean and extensible:\n- add a contribution point for synchronization extensions\n  - Those extensions should not have to gather all the files that have to be synced. vscode should do this and then pass them to the extensions\n  - Such an extension's job is only to upload/download the files, passed to them (so we can have the `gist upload`/`svn upload`/`git repo upload`/`dropbox`/`filesystem`/`onedrive`/`ftp`/`other services`.\n  - Or maybe gather all settings into one big json object and pass that.\n  - Support versioning and non versioning extensions\n- add a remote_settings.json to build on top of the workspace-settings/user-settings stack.\n- allow automatic and user triggered synchronization\n\nOk... just some ideas :smile:

https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2679 https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/229\n\nI strongly feel that 'code' or 'Code' is a bad choice as executable name, the former is extremely ambiguous and is asking for conflicts with other packages (existing ones or future ones, or organization-private tools), the latter being rather unconventional on Linux platform to start with capital letter.\n\nSince the community seems to already nickname the product VSCode, why not change the executable to 'vscode', preferrably before GA since sooner is better than later?\n\nAlternatively, if the products name is supposed to be Code (and Visual Studio isn't considered a real part of the name), I'd go with 'mscode' (as in \"Code, the one from Microsoft and not something else named Code\").\n\nReasons to change asap:\n- The more time goes by, and especially once VSCode gains more command-line options, the more external software will bank on a specific executable name, making a switch more problematic.\n- Less post-installation hassle or downright conflicts (especially installing from packages) will mean faster adoption.\n\nReasons why not to change:\n- Other packages have similar problems, like Imagemagick 'convert', 'display' or 'import' (yikes) for example, so no need to make a fuzz about it.\n- Some utilities already assume the executable name being 'code', for example dotBunnys VSCode Unity integration plugin.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2722/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2721","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2721/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2721/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2721/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2721","id":131481337,"number":2721,"title":"Cursor

Note that I have provided a value for the `module` property:\n\n```\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"es5\",\n        \"module\": \"system\",\n        \"noImplicitReturns\": true,\n        \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n        \"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch\": true,\n        \"preserveConstEnums\": true,\n        \"sourceMap\": true,\n        \"outDir\": \"./src/scripts/compiled\",\n        \"rootDir\": \"./src/scripts\"\n    },\n    \"exclude\": [\n        \"node_modules\",\n        \"jspm_packages\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nI've tried other values for the property, such as `amd` and `commonjs` without any luck.  I've also restarted the IDE several times.\n\nThe code compiles with no errors when I compile from the command line.  (I'm using [gulp-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-typescript) for TypeScript compilation.\n\nI have TypeScript 1.8 beta installed globally via `npm`, although this problem was also present when TypeScript 1.7 was installed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4899","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507415105","x-github-request-id":"E235:366E:798144:1002BE1:59D947FF","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1102>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1100>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"7eb1619592760cd1370b0902f6b01411\"","status":"200 OK"}}
