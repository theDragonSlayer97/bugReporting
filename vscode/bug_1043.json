VSCode Version: 0.10.11\n- OS Version: OSX\n\nI am in the process of writing a html select ui element (I will be opening a PR for this eventually), however I am having an issue getting the value of the dropdown on a change event.\n\nThe onchange function is below.  This issue is e.target.value is null because it is not defined on `EventTarget`.  I have tried fetching the changed value via `this.$select.attr('value')` but that returns null as well.  Is there a better way to structure this or what am I doing wrong here or can we update the core EventType to have the property `value` on it?\n\n```\n this.$select.on(['change'], (e: Event, b: Builder) => {\n    console.log(e.target.attr('value'));\n});\n```\n\nChanging it to the following works and the value of the select is returned but the linter throws errors on it because `value` is not defined on `EventTarget`.  I guess a dirty hack here would excluding it from the linter, what would be the correct syntax for this?\n\n```\n this.$select.on(['change'], (e: Event, b: Builder) => {\n    console.log(e.target.value);\n});\n```\n\nI also tried the following but the property value is not defined on HTMLElement.\n\n```\nthis.$select.on(['change'], (e: Event, b: Builder) => {\n    this._opts.onChange(b.currentElement.value);\n});\n```\n\nThe code I have for the dropdown is below.\n\n```\n/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n *  Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

VSCode Version: 0.10.11\n- OS Version: win10 10586.164\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. open folder containing clone of remote origin master\n2. click on git branch status area in bottom left corner, or enter ctrl+p or f1+>Git: Checkout, and enter name of remote origin branch you want to local copy to reference.  the git ouput window shows \"git checkout -q -b someTopicBranch\" and \"git fetch\" were executed.\n3.  folder doesn't contain copy of remote origin topic branch so from command line enter \"git.exe config -l --local\" where you'll see that branch.someTopicBranch.remote/.merge entries are not present\n4.  from command line enter \"git branch -u origin/someTopicBranch\" or \"git branch --set-upstream-to=someTopicBranch\" to update local config to contain branch.someTopicBranch.remote/.merge entries\n5.  from vscode you can now use git | ... | pull == \"git pull\" to retrieve the contents of the remote origin someTopicBranch that already existed\n\nMy thinking is that steps 3 thru 5 should be automated for you in case where you are not looking to create new topic branch and optionally later push it into remote origin but rather create local repo topic branch into which you sync the details of remote origin copy of topic branch that already exists.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/4459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4957","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507415105","x-github-request-id":"C914:2B9B:805B45:105A75F:59D946EE","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1044>;
