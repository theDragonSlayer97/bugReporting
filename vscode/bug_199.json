would be great if each of you can familiarise yourself with smoke test area that you are responsible of (this involves code review, general automated smoke test operation). Smoke test areas are defined as here - https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Smoke-Test.\r\n\r\nThis is required to ensure we reduce any potential flaws in our smoke tests. Moreover, going further you may need to implement some tests if you add new feature to VS Code, or redesign some of existing smoke test parts due to any UI changes. Hence, it is important that you are familiar with the way automated smoke test is working now.\r\n\r\nHere is a general readme on the code - https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/test/smoke.\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing your area make sure you understand:\r\n- Code architecture\r\n- What to do when smoke test fails (looking it up on VSTS website, downloading test artifacts after build has finished, debugging)\r\n- Weak points\r\n\r\nAlso think of the way you would improve the smoke test, and write your thoughts here. Please check yourself off once you became familiar with it.\r\n  - [ ] @alexandrudima\r\n  - [x] @weinand\r\n  - [ ] @chrmarti\r\n  - [x] @tyriar\r\n  - [ ] @dbaeumer\r\n  - [x] @bpasero\r\n  - [x]
