true\r\n\r\n\r\nI think the problem is caused here ,i change the  value of \"typescript.check.tscVersion\" as false, but\r\nit still check,so  I want to change the value of  \"typescript.tsdk\", but  I cant get the correct value。

computer to open VSCode\r\n- Create a `console.log('Hello, World!');` JavaScript file\r\n- Launch as node application from the VSCode Debugger view\r\n\r\nProduces error: `Cannot find runtime 'node' on PATH`\r\n\r\n**Given:**\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n- My launch.json:\r\n\r\n<!-- language: lang-json -->\r\n\r\n    {\r\n    \t\"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n    \t\"configurations\": [\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t\"type\": \"node\",\r\n    \t\t\t\"request\": \"launch\",\r\n    \t\t\t\"name\": \"Build\",\r\n    \t\t\t\"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/build.js\",\r\n    \t\t\t\"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\"\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t]\r\n    }\r\n\r\n- I have moved nodejs to within 2048 characters of my PATH variable.\r\n- I have restarted my computer.\r\n- I have restarted VSCode.\r\n- `node -v` gives `v6.9.5`\r\n\r\n*From both CMD and the Integrated Terminal (tried both sysnative/cmd and PowerShell):*\r\n\r\n- `PATH` contains `D:/Program Files/nodejs`\r\n- `where node` returns `D:/Program Files/nodejs/node.exe`\r\n\r\n*From the Google Developer Console:*\r\n\r\n- `process.env.PATH` contains `D:/Program Files/nodejs`\r\n- Running the following code produces `D:/Program Files/nodejs/node.exe`:\r\n\r\n<!-- language: lang-js -->\r\n\r\n    (function(){\r\n        const cp = require('child_process');\r\n        const env = Object.assign({}, process.env, {\r\n            ATOM_SHELL_INTERNAL_RUN_AS_NODE: '1',\r\n            ELECTRON_NO_ATTACH_CONSOLE: '1'\r\n        });\r\n        const result = cp.spawnSync('where', ['node'], {\r\n            detached: true,\r\n            stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', process.stderr],\r\n            env,\r\n            encoding: 'utf8'\r\n        });\r\n        \r\n        console.log(result.stdout);\r\n    })();\r\n\r\n**Additional (Maybe Related)**\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n- Also .NET-Core applications behave identically - terminal and cmd works, `dotnet` is on the path, but Launch from VSCode debugger view fails to find CLI Tools on the path.\r\n\r\n- Attaching to an existing `dotnet` process produces a different error:\r\n`Please set up the launch configuration file for your application. command 'csharp.listProcess' not found`\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\n\r\nI've been doing some debugging, and it looks like the following code produces `Command Failed: echo test`:\r\n\r\n<!-- language: lang-js -->\r\n\r\n    require('child_process')\r\n    .execSync('echo test', {cwd: workspaceRoot, env: process.env});\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, it winds up calling\r\n\r\n<!-- language: lang-js -->\r\n\r\n    require('child_process')\r\n    .spawnSync('cmd', ['/s', '/c', '\"echo test\"'], {cwd: workspaceRoot, env: process.env});\r\n\r\nThe command it builds under the hood is `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /s /c \"echo test\"` which I tested *outside* of VSCode, and does indeed print `test`.\r\n\r\nInside VSCode, the `spawnSync` call reveals that the exit code is `3221225477`.\r\n\r\nIn fact, every time I use `child_process` to execute something via cmd, the exit code is `3221225477`. I can get `spawnSync` to start other processes aside from cmd, though. This works:\r\n\r\n<!-- language: lang-js -->\r\n\r\n    require('child_process')\r\n    .spawnSync('node', ['build.js'], {cwd: workspaceRoot, env: process.env});","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19995","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19995/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19995/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19995/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19995","id":205470346,"number":19995,"title":"open
