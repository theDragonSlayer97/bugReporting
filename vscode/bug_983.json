User open the command palette and search for Acme extension then click Install.\n\n**Expects:**\nVSCode should install Acme v1.7.0 instead of Acme v2.0.0 since the Acme extension's developer might use newer API calls that are not exist in VSCode v1.0.0 which can leads to extension crash.\n## Potential Solutions\n1. Let VSCode query only compatible version of the extensions upon install, update.\n2. Allow developers to specify minimum VSCode version on each extension submission (potentially `packages.json`).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6288","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6288/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6288/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6288/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6288","id":154257489,"number":6288,"title":"[git] File is shown under `Changes` even when all changes have been staged","user":{"login":"kumarharsh","id":760112,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/760112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh","html_url":"https://github.com/kumarharsh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarharsh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":296835379,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/git","name":"git","color":"1d76db","default":false},{"id":256129998,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/question","name":"question","color":"708090","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-05-11T14:27:44Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T08:37:17Z","closed_at":"2016-05-13T10:48:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.1.0-inside\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
