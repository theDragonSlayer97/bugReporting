You can then just drag back up and go back to the single pane edit at any time. This is much easier than having multiple windows open in the same file, and would be greatly appreciated.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22744","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22744/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22744/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22744/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22744","id":214753011,"number":22744,"title":"TS

up from https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12448. We now no longer open 2 different files when using different casing for a file path (macOS, Windows) but we can do better and prevent wrongly-cased paths altogether. \r\n\r\nWe should identify the places where paths are coming in that we cannot trust in terms of casing (e.g. output from the terminal) and then convert this path to the real path when opening in the editor. \r\n\r\nFinding out the real path as it is on disk is unfortunately not possible with node.js APIs. We have a helper method ([here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/base/node/extfs.ts#L383)) that walks each parent folder until the file is reached to find out the actual casing.\r\n\r\nA better approach would be to write a native module that does this in one call ideally. We could try to use [`uv_fs_realpath`](https://github.com/libuv/libuv/pull/531), keeping in mind the [caveats](https://github.com/saghul/libuv/commit/6938f6b0bdbcfd40d7e0cdd3ff298cf46b3dca0d) though. \r\n\r\nnode.js once [used](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/3594/files) `uv_fs_realpath` inside `fs.realpath` but took it out again due to the issues documented.\r\n\r\nA [wrapper](https://github.com/isaacs/fs.realpath/blob/master/index.js) exists to deal with the error cases.

I have a very unpleasant bug with reexporting default submodule export in index files. It is a very common case for me and it works with current bundler (Webpack), but looks broken in the editor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create `submodule.js` file with following content: \r\n\r\n```\r\nexport default function DefaultExport () {}\r\nexport function TestExport () {}\r\n```\r\n2. Create `index.js` with reexports:\r\n```\r\nexport default from './submodule1.js';\r\nexport TestExport from './submodule1.js';\r\n```\r\n\r\nVS Code highlights reexports as syntax errors and breaks \"Go To Definition\" logic, which is very useful.\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/654461/23992643/b930af3e-0a4e-11e7-96fc-47f87e55b3ee.png)\r\n\r\nHere is my jsconfig.json file:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n        \"target\": \"ES6\",\r\n        \"jsx\": \"react\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"exclude\": [\r\n        \"node_modules\",\r\n        \"build\",\r\n
