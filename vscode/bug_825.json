You end up with\n\n``` JavaScript\n<script>\nvar testVar1 = \"\\\"sometext\\\";\nvar testVar2 = \\\"sometext\\\";\n</script>\n```\n\nThis may not be the best example, but it shows that typing with multiple cursors has the potential to not do what the user expects (the entered text being the same at all cursor locations) and break things. I think other editors work around this by disabling the context detection when there are multiple cursors.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11026","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11026/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11026/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11026/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11026","id":173467370,"number":11026,"title":"Fake

VSCode Version:1.4.0\n- OS Version:Windows 10\n\nSteps:\nFirst of all, thank you for this good editor. It's nice and I enjoy using it.\nThe Find box has some minor issues:\nSuppose you want to search for a certain phrase and make some modifications near that phrase.\nEg: Consider this text:\n\n```\nx = process(\"cat\");\ny = process(\"mouse\")\n... ...\nz = process(\"dog\");\n...\n```\n\nSay you want to change it to this:\n\n```\nx = process($(\"cat\").getId());\ny = process($(\"mouse\").getId());\n... ...\nz = process($(\"dog\").getId());\n...\n```\n\n(for whatever reason),\n\nYou'd hit Ctrl+F and type in \"process\" in the Find box. \nProblem 1) Once it highlights the first occurrence of the word 'process', the Escape key does not close that Find box. I have to visually locate the highlighted word, and take my mouse to click near that word and position my cursor there.\nContinuing with the example, I reach `x = process(\"cat\");` and position my cursor after the opening curve bracket `(` and type in `$(` and then move to the `\"` following `cat` and type in `).getId()` to change it to `x = process($(\"cat\").getId());`. \nThen, to avoid typing in `).getId()` again, I select the word `).getId()` that I just typed, copy it and then I want to continue my search for `process`.\nProblem 2) There's no way to continue my previous search now. Hitting Ctrl+F while this is selected automatically overwrites my Find box's contents `process` with `).getId()`. There should be a switch to disable this behavior.\nProblem 3) The Next Match and Previous Match arrows on the Find box don't work. Clicking them doesn't do anything. There aren't any keyboard shortcuts on them either.\nProblem 4) The find box shows a misleading \"No Results\" in red background even when it actually finds some results and highlights them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11012","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11012/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11012/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11012/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11012","id":173427113,"number":11012,"title":"Some
