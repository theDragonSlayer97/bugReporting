It happens sporadically, but it has happened on 2 different computers for me (both mac OS sierra). Randomly, vscode will stop registering cmd + c or cmd + v. I've confirmed by attempting to paste the text in a different app, so it didn't even copy in the first place. IT also will not paste text copied from outside vscode. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, vscode will randomly stop accepting keyboard input. I can't type anything (and also can't copy paste while that is occurring). \r\n\r\nI can fix the second problem by restarting vscode. But often i have to restart 2 or 3 times for the first problem to be resolved.\r\n\r\nI also took a picture of my vscode `Problems` panel while this was going on, and the only errors are typescript

VSCode Version: 1.12.1\r\n- OS Version: OSX 10.12.4\r\n\r\nIf the `files.watcherExclude` preference includes a pattern such as `**/mysymlink/**`, and the target of that symlink does not contain an actual directory named `mysymlink`, then the files will not be excluded.\r\n\r\nThis, in combination with the way the [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) build tool works, results in my org's builds occasionally failing on OSX if VSCode is open, because the OS has hits its limit on how many files can be open. In our build, Bazel created thousands of directories in its working directories, and I had tried to tell VSCode's watcher to ignore those directories, but it didn't, since they were actually symlinks, not directories.\r\n\r\nLike I said, we use [Bazel](https://bazel.build/); Bazel creates several symlinks with names like `bazel-out`, `bazel-bin`, etc. On OSX, those map to `/private/var/tmp/_bazel_<username>/...'`\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download and expand [example.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/files/984863/example.zip). This is a small sample project that builds with Bazel.\r\n2. Download and install the [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) build tool.\r\n3. Start Visual Studio Code, pointing at this directory.\r\n4. Notice that .vscode/settings.json is configured with:\r\n\r\n        \"files.watcherExclude\": {\r\n            ...,\r\n            \"**/bazel-*/**\": true\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    This is because, as mentioned above, Bazel will create several symlinks in the root with names that start with `bazel-*`, and will put all of the build artifacts into those directories.\r\n5. Save a list of all file handles that VSCode's `Code Helper` program has open: `lsof | grep '^Code' > lsof-before`\r\n6. From the command line, compile the project: `bazel build //...`\r\n7. Now repeat step 5, saving the new list of file handles: `lsof | grep '^Code' > lsof-after`\r\n8. Compare the two lists of files handles. You will notice that the second list of file handles is longer, and that it includes several handles for files/directories of the form `/private/var/tmp/_bazel_<username>/...`.\r\n9. Let's fix it. Tell it to ignore those files:\r\n\r\n        \"files.watcherExclude\": {\r\n            ...,\r\n            \"**/_bazel_*/**\": true\r\n        }\r\n\r\n10. Exit VSCode\r\n11. `bazel clean`\r\n12. Repeat the test.\r\n\r\nIn the above scenario, since this is a tiny sample project, you will only see a small number of newly-opened directories, so it's not a problem. But in my company's real build system, before compiling, Code Helper had 921 handles open, and after, it had 6,767, so OSX hit its handle limit and my build failed.\r\n\r\nIn general, I think I would argue that people would expect a pattern like `**/mysymlink/**` to work, and that they wouldn't want to have to think about the name of the directory that is pointed to by the symlink.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26247/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26246","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26246/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26246/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26246/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/26246","id":227199678,"number":26246,"title":"Switch
