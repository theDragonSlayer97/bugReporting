It's not trivial to configure your build project to generate the correct source maps, and it's difficult to understand if, and when they are wrong.\n\nI'd be amazing if you could add better diagnostic tools so it'd be easier for the users to debug these kind of issues. For example, you could add a new feature that when you put a breakpoint on TypeScript, if you hover over it you'll see a tooltip that shows you a snippet from the mapped JavaScript code, and where was the breakpoint put exactly on the JavaScript code. You could also have a \"More info\" button on that tooltip, that would decode the values that are included in the source map, and show you exactly how the source map says the characters around the breakpoint should be mapped to the source code.\n\nWe've also noticed that sometimes if you put breakpoints and the source map is not completely valid, the breakpoints might disappear completely, or appear at the end of the file. It'd be nice if you could also have more validations around this (for example check that the breakpoint line should be less than the total lines of the file where you are putting that breakpoint), and show a nice error message with diagnostic information when something doesn't appear to be right, instead of just \"ignoring\" that breakpoint or error silently.\n\nFor more information you can see an issue that was created against our extension: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-native/issues/206#issuecomment-209109389\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5203","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5203/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5203/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5203/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5203","id":147885593,"number":5203,"title":"Not able to perform folding action on <HTML> tag.","user":{"login":"v-pavanp","id":17735796,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17735796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp","html_url":"https://github.com/v-pavanp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v-pavanp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aeschli","id":6461412,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6461412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli","html_url":"https://github.com/aeschli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeschli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-12T21:55:13Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T06:59:25Z","closed_at":"2016-04-22T06:59:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.0.0-alpha\n- OS Version: Windows10\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
