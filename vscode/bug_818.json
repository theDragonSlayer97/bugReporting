for macOS's `NSFindPboard`, which is a global shared find buffer.  Which allows one to put text into the find buffer from other native apps like Chrome, TextEdit, Safari, Sublime, etc. and then switch to other Cocoa apps and use `cmd-g` to find next matching text.\n\nI suggest binding this new action to `cmd-e` for ux sensibility on macOS.\n\nfrom https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3431#issuecomment-239508682\n\n> Based on actions.find in VSCode, each open buffer seems to have it's own (non-shared) find pasteboard. So actions.find works fine in a single buffer, but I can't cmd-e some text in one file, then cmd-g it in my next file...\n\nWe need to add a new action/function such as `editor.action.addSelectionToNextFindMatchInGlobalBuffer` which may work in other systems as well, but initially for macOS.\n\nElectron will likely need modifications to expose an API capturing the `NSFindPboard`. \nref: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4650#issuecomment-130619175\n\nAlternatively, we can execute a shell script to gain access to the global find pasteboard in macOS with `pbpaste -pboard find`.\n- VSCode Version: 1.4.0\n- OS Version: macOS\n\n/cc @bpasero

with errors will flicker while the user types and errors are recomputed.\n\nThis is especially a problem for `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` errors, which by their nature can't be immediately fixed, if you are in the middle of writing a function and haven't needed to use some locals yet.\n\nTo reproduce:\n\n```\nmkdir repro; cd repro\ncode-insiders .\n```\n\nMake a `tsconfig.json` of:\n\n```\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"noUnusedLocals\": true,\n        \"noUnusedParameters\": true\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen open `a.ts` and type out (don't paste):\n\n```\nfunction f(a: number) {\n    const b = 1;\n    const c = 2;\n    const d = 3;\n    const e = 4;\n    const f = 5;\n}\n```\n\nYou'll notice that the red underlines under `a` through `f` flicker while you type.\nThis is hard to see for this example, but much more noticable for a large project, where updating errors takes longer (increasing flicker time).\n\nAs a side note, we are drawing attention to unused locals that aren't really an error until you've finished writing the function that would use them. A good solution to that would be another issue, but eliminating flickering would greatly reduce the distraction.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11228","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11228/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11228/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11228/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11228","id":174056119,"number":11228,"title":"Editor does not open when working offline","user":{"login":"sanjayojha","id":3258151,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3258151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjayojha","html_url":"https://github.com/sanjayojha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjayojha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjayojha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjayojha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjayojha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjayojha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjayojha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjayojha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjayojha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjayojha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-30T15:49:44Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T16:43:37Z","closed_at":"2016-08-30T16:43:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.4.0 (6276dcb0ae497766056b4c09ea75be1d76a8b679, 2016-08-04T16:45:31.680Z)\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.10586\n\nI am trying to edit some php, html, css and js file on my local development machine, while working I had turnoff the internet.
