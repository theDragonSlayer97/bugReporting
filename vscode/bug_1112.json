we have the ability to specify a `preLaunchTask` in `launch.json` configurations.  This is extremely helpful in running a task that should kick off before launch.\n\nConversely, there could be **post** launch tasks that would be helpful to automate their execution.  An example of a post launch task would be to, after the launch of the application, open a browser window with a specific URL to the current application.\n\nIn summary, a `postLaunchTask` would be helpful as `preLaunchTask` is.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2405/reactions","total_count":15,"+1":15,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2404","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2404/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2404/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2404/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2404","id":128985271,"number":2404,"title":"Add React Native workspace detection","user":{"login":"susanshi","id":8160956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8160956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanshi","html_url":"https://github.com/susanshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susanshi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"SofianHn","id":2146228,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2146228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn","html_url":"https://github.com/SofianHn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"SofianHn","id":2146228,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2146228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn","html_url":"https://github.com/SofianHn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SofianHn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-01-27T00:19:15Z","updated_at":"2016-01-28T18:27:15Z","closed_at":"2016-01-28T18:27:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"A typical react native project will have the following characteristics, in the order of how accurately it indicates that this is a react-native project. \n1.
