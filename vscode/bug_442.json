Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version:  1.10.2\r\n- OS Version: Mac OSX (10.11.6)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open VS Code integrated terminal\r\n2. Echo a relative path (eg. ```echo \"src/app.js\"```)\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nLet's say you have a build system that outputs a stack trace on a build error or failed test. If this was run from the integrated terminal, the file paths in the output should be included as clickable links which can be clicked to open the file in VSCode.\r\n\r\nHowever, this only works if the path is either an absolute path (e.g. ```~/work/project/src/app.js```) or a relative path that begins with \"./\". \r\n\r\nMany build systems and tools output file paths relative to the directory the command was run, without the leading \"./\", Karma for example. So the output would be something like: ```src/app.js```, not ```./src/app.js```. The first is not matched by VSCode as an openable path, but the second is.\r\n\r\nI believe that what is determined to be a path comes from the Regex in \"terminalLinkHandler.ts\"\r\n\r\nIs there a reason why relative paths of this form (e.g. no leading \"./\") are not included?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22527","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22527/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22527/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22527/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/22527","id":213755045,"number":22527,"title":"rename
