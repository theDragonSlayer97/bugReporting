I will need another window to put the other tab even though it's under the same folder, maybe it's not a problem i i have the same monitor resolution, but currently, i am using one laptop monitor (1366x768) and additional lcd monitor (1920x1080) which give problem if i try to display the editor under resolution (3286x ????) just to compare codes.\n1. There is no option to let the editor tab float as independent window\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5217","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5217/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5217/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5217/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5217","id":147973613,"number":5217,"title":"Windows
