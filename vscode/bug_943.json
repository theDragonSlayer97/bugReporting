Notice that common breakpoint operations are not available\n### Justification\n\nVS Code does a great job of allowing the user to stay away from the mouse and have a keyboard-only experience.  There are common breakpoint operations (delete all breakpoints, disable all breakpoints, etc.) that developers use frequently to debug.  I believe that these common operations should be available in the command palette and also have configurable key bindings.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7489","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7489/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7489/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7489/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7489","id":159466463,"number":7489,"title":"Timeout due to certificate error during \"ext install\"","user":{"login":"KeithBallard","id":19842971,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19842971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeithBallard","html_url":"https://github.com/KeithBallard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeithBallard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeithBallard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeithBallard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeithBallard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeithBallard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeithBallard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeithBallard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeithBallard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeithBallard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joaomoreno","id":22350,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno","html_url":"https://github.com/joaomoreno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaomoreno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-06-09T17:39:59Z","updated_at":"2016-06-14T22:15:42Z","closed_at":"2016-06-13T17:56:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: 1.2\n- OS Version: Windows 7\n\nI realize that this has been brought up tangentially in a few other issues (#69 and #155).  However, the issues resolved in both of those are not my current issue.\n\nAt my company, market.visualstudio.com is issued a certificate after the https traffic is intercepted.  It seems that VS Code uses the IP 191.238.172.191 when trying to browse/install extensions, which causes a cert problem because the cert was issued to market.visualstudio.com, causing a mismatch.  If I browse to 191.238.172.191, IE and firefox complain, but market.visualstudio.com works just fine.  The computer does not use any proxy settings so the \"http.proxyStrictSSL\": false setting does not help.  Why is the IP address being used in the first place instead of the hostname?\n\nAny
