Install this vsix file: http://s3-test.spring.io/sts4/vscode-extensions/snapshots/vscode-concourse-0.0.2-201705052220.vsix\r\n2. Create a text file called 'pipeline.yml' and put this text in it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresources:\r\n- name: fff\r\n  type: foo\r\n  <*>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `<*>` marks the spot where to put the cursor. So delete it, and put your cursor there.\r\n\r\nPress CTRL-SPACE to invoke content assist.\r\n\r\nThe order of the content assist items that appears in vscode 1.11 is like this and is the correct order:\r\n\r\n- check_every\r\n- source\r\n- ← groups\r\n- ← jobs\r\n- ← resource_types\r\n- ← - name\r\n\r\nAfter updating to vscode 1.12 today, the order changed to this:\r\n\r\n- ← groups\r\n- ← jobs\r\n- ← resource_types\r\n- ← - name\r\n- check_every\r\n- source\r\n\r\nThe completion items my extension produces explicitly sets a `sortText` to get exactly the desired ordering. Somehow, it seems like VScode 1.12 no longer consults the sort text but instead just uses the label for sorting. I double-checked that my extension indeed sets the sort-text. Below is some log output showing `${sortText}:${label}` for these completion items as 'proof'.\r\n\r\n```\r\n00000: check_every\r\n00001: source\r\n00002: ← groups\r\n00003: ← jobs\r\n00004: ← resource_types\r\n00005: ← - name\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26095","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26095/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26095/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26095/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26095","id":226718869,"number":26095,"title":"Out-of-the-box
