There is a problem that inside package class that implements `CompletionItemProvider`, `provideCompletionItems` method doesn't fire when I type `-` inside _import/require_ string and this results in empty completion list. When you type next letter e.g. `d` it filters completion items JUST by this letter. It should still take the whole string into account.\n\nThis issue somehow references this [issue](https://github.com/ChristianKohler/NpmIntellisense/issues/10) from NpmIntellisense package.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n\nInstall [NpmIntellisense](https://github.com/ChristianKohler/NpmIntellisense) package. Prepare project with `package.json` that have `react` and `react-dom` extension installed (and saved!!!).\n1. Create some JS file.\n2. Type `import React from 'react-'`\n3.
