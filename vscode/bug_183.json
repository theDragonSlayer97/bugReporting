VS Code already has language support for Javascript (built-in) and Python (extension); creating language server extensions for other languages should be relatively straightforward. The procedure for [writing a debugger extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/example-debuggers) is well-defined; I imagine it should be possible to write an extension to LibreOffice that would convert it into a debugger adapter.\r\n\r\nI realize it would require an extension installed into LibreOffice, but the issue here is what would be required on the VS Code side (built-in, or via an extension).\r\n\r\nI think there is one major hurdle. LibreOffice by default uses files in the OpenDocument format, which are ZIP files with text files as contents (they inspired Office Open XML). Script files are stored within the ZIP file, under `/Scripts/<language>`. VS Code is highly oriented to files and folders on disk. Is it possible to bridge this gap? I can see two approaches:\r\n\r\n1. **Mount the entire ZIP file to a filesystem mountpoint, then VS Code will be able to create, edit, and save documents normally.** This is problematic, because the Solution Explorer will expose the entire contents of the file, not only the scripts/macros. While this theoretically _might_ be useful in certain scenarios, there is the danger that the user could edit different parts of the file contents in various ways unsupported by the OpenDocument format.\r\n2. **All interactions with the scripts would be through the application's API** -- Solution Explorer would display the tree hierarchy returned by the API, creating/editing/deleting files would also be done through the application's API. Does VS Code support this kind of scenario?\r\n\r\nNote: Solving this problem would open the way for other applications to easily use VS Code as their script editors.  Specifically, there is a highly-voted UserVoice item for [using Python or R embedded in Excel](https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304921-excel-for-windows-desktop-application/suggestions/10549005-python-as-an-excel-scripting-language). If VS Code could be leveraged in this way, then it would allow any language/debugger supported by VS Code to be similarly embedded in Office documents.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30306","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30306/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30306/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30306/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30306","id":241517367,"number":30306,"title":"Can't
