When using the `import` syntax in JS and TypeScript, VSCode doesn't display the types filename correctly.\r\n\r\nGiven the file hierarchy:\r\n<img width=\"208\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-09-24 at 6 08 10 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4955582/30788090-85aed14e-a153-11e7-806b-80c034495462.png\">\r\n\r\nThe file `main.ts` contains the code:\r\n```typescript\r\n\r\n\r\nimport Rect from './shape/Rect';\r\nimport Fill from './fill/Fill';\r\n\r\nmain();\r\n\r\nfunction main(){\r\n  let startRect = new Rect(20, 20);\r\n  let matrix = startRect.render(true);\r\n  Fill.getPoints(matrix);\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe compiled javascript file also displays the error:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\"use strict\";\r\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\r\nconst Rect_1 = require(\"./shape/Rect\");\r\nconst Fill_1 = require(\"./fill/Fill\");\r\nmain();\r\nfunction main() {\r\n  let startRect = new Rect_1.default(20, 20);\r\n  let matrix = startRect.render(true);\r\n  Fill.getPoints(matrix);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Inside of VSCode** the file renders `'./fill/Fill'` as `'./filFill'`.\r\n\r\nThe filepath still resolves correctly and the missing `l/` characters are still deletable (nothing happens on-delete, they act as invisible characters\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nReproduces without

have a problem with the multiline problemsMatcher and word wrapped results in the terminal console. \r\n\r\nWhen I integrate jasmine error reports to vscode \"problems\" tab and my vscode window is small, the reported error lines are cut at the visual width of the terminal window. Because multiline pattern matching works line by line, those wrapped lines doesn't contains whole information and  are not consistent any more with my pattern matching regex expressions. \r\n\r\nIs there any way to disable word wrapping in the terminal window or do you have any other workaround maybe ? \r\n\r\nI tested with two different terminals (Git Bash and win. PowerShell), because both have the same behavior I think the wrapping is at the vscode side ?   \r\n  \r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI describe whole integration between jasmine and vscode in [this blog article](http://bisaga.com/blog/programming/testing-typescript-node-app-with-jasmine/) \r\n\r\n1. create project with jasmine tests, run jasmine in the terminal successfully, then \r\n2. create task with the content: \r\n{\r\n    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558\r\n    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format\r\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n    \"command\":

maximized size of the terminal window , pattern matcher does recognize errors and create problem in the problems tab\r\nAn error line (where the last regex pattern looks for file, line and column) looks like: \r\n\r\n`\r\n        at UserContext.it (c:\\Bisaga\\Workspaces\\learning\\mytest\\spec\\myapi-spec.ts:16:32) \r\n`\r\n\r\n4. run the task with very narrow size of the terminal window, pattern matcher does not recognize errors any more because the error line reported from the jasmine is now in 3 lines ...\r\nAn error line from jasmine is now in the 3 lines instead of the one : \r\n\r\n```\r\n        at UserContext.it (c:\\Bisaga\\Worksp\r\naces\\learning\\mytest\\spec\\myapi-spec.ts:16:\r\n32)\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check.

say I'm applying 2 decorators to the following string: `foo bar foo`, the first one changes the color of the whole string to green, the second makes `bar` red.

For instance if I apply the `red` decorator after the `green` one, it should take precedence and make `bar` red, while still keeping the rest green.\r\n\r\nThis kind of logic can already be implemented in an extension, but it seems low-level and general enough to deserve to be implemented in VSC itself.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34905/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34904","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34904/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34904/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34904/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34904","id":260085674,"number":34904,"title":"connected variables can not be modified properly with snippet function","user":{"login":"mkitby","id":15389150,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/15389150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkitby","html_url":"https://github.com/mkitby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkitby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkitby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkitby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkitby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkitby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkitby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkitby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkitby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkitby/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":409283388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/caused-by-extension","name":"caused-by-extension","color":"E2A1C2","default":false},{"id":295276395,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/VIM","name":"VIM","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rebornix","id":876920,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/876920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix","html_url":"https://github.com/rebornix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rebornix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2017-09-24T13:51:12Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T07:21:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.16.1 (27492b6bf3acb0775d82d2f87b25a93490673c6d, 2017-09-14T16:38:23.027Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.15063\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\nExtension|Author (truncated)|Version\r\n---|---|---\r\ngitignore|cod|0.5.0\r\narm|dan|0.1.2\r\npython|don|0.7.0\r\ncpptools|ms-|0.12.4\r\nsnippet-creator|nik|0.0.4\r\nvim|vsc|0.10.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
