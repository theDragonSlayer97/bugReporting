test plan for the December iteration plan #917.\n### Debug - long text wraps in repl\n- [x] win @alexandrudima \n- [x] mac @jrieken\n- [ ] linux @SofianHn  \n\nVerify that long text now nicely wraps across multiple lines in the debug repl both for evaluation requests and for output text.\n### Debug - breakpoint state\n- [ ] win @alexandrudima \n- [x] mac @jrieken\n- [x] linux @aeschli \n\nWe have changed breakpoints states and now show it differently in the UI. Verify:\n- new UI properly and intuitivly reflects if breakpoints are enabled, disabled, verified or deactivated. \n- breakpoints get hit / not hit depending on their enablement state\n### Debug - extension debugging\n- [ ] win @dbaeumer \n- [ ] mac @SofianHn \n- [x] linux @aeschli \n\nExtension debugging is now using a new strategy to attach the debugger to the extension\n- verify you can debug your extension as before\n- verify you can restart debugging from the debugger side and the debugger reconnects properly\n- verify you can change folders or refresh on the extension development side and the debugger reconnects\n- verify closing the extension development side stops debugging\n- verify stopping the session from the debugger closes the extension development window\n### Update - channel from settings\n- [ ] win @alexandrudima \n- [x] mac @joaomoreno \n\nVerify you can change the update channel from settings.\n### View - persisted zoom settings\n- [ ] win @dbaeumer \n- [x] mac | linux @weinand \n\nVerify you can change and persist the zoom factor for windows. \n- negative and positive values work\n- the zoom actions are still working as before but do not persist\n- the change is live\n### Quick open - Path and Fuzzy matching\n- [x] win @aeschli \n- [ ] mac | linux @isidorn \n\nUnless you include a path character in your query or enabled fuzzy matching, quick open for files should work as before:\n- results are sorted properly with most relevant ones to the top\n- editor history always comes first on top of matching file results\n- if you narrow down a search, subsequent matching is fast and does not go to the disk (verify with a larger workspace)\n\nVerify the new support to match on paths if included in search\n- using the native path separator in the search enables matching on (workspace relative) paths for both editor history results and file matching\n- more relevant results are still sorted to the top\n- results are highlighted properly also in their path segment\n\nVerify the new support for fuzzy file matching\n- find and enable the new setting to enable fuzzy matching for quick open. this will only enable fuzzy matching for file search, it should not have any impact to other quick open providers, nor the editor history search\n- verify results from file searches match on the entire (workspace relative) path of the file without having to use the native path separator\n- verify matching happens in substrings of the path, not requiring the characters to be in sequence (e.g. \"fr\" would match \"**f**oo_ba**r**\")\n- more relevant results are sorted to the top\n### Extensions info in status bar #1123\n- [ ] win @bpasero \n- [ ] mac @egamma \n- [ ] linux @SofianHn  \n\nVerify that the extensions status shows up in the status bar if you have extension errors. Verify clicking on the status bar shows all the error / warning messages to the user and that you can uninstall the extension via action in message.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1095","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1095/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1095/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1095/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1095","id":120952319,"number":1095,"title":"Failed

basically need a permalink to the latest VSCode distributable.**\n\nI was trying to write a Python installation script which will download the latest release, unzip it, make symlinks, copy a VSCode.desktop I have written ([here](https://github.com/hashhar/vscode/tree/hashhar-desktop/resources/linux) as a fork of VSCode) into /usr/share/applications to register a launcher into Unity and GNOME.\n\nI have stumbled upon an issue though. Since no releases are being done (not the source files, the actual installation zipballs which are downloaded from the website) I cannot use the GitHub Releases API (I wrote a preliminary proof of concept [here](https://github.com/hashhar/vscode/blob/hashhar-desktop/resources/linux/install.py)).\n\nI also wasn't able to trigger a click on the download page. (I can do it with Mechanize but that is a dependency and I want the script to be as self sustained as possible).\n\n**So how do I go about this? I basically need a permalink to the latest VSCode distributable.**\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1083","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1083/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1083/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1083/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1083","id":120863968,"number":1083,"title":"error while processing request ' _request ' (exception exception ) ","user":{"login":"thibault1907","id":16197112,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16197112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibault1907","html_url":"https://github.com/thibault1907","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibault1907/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibault1907/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibault1907/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibault1907/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibault1907/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibault1907/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibault1907/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibault1907/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibault1907/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-12-07T20:46:26Z","updated_at":"2015-12-09T08:03:12Z","closed_at":"2015-12-09T08:01:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This is the error that comes up when i try to launch my first program.
