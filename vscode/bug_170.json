issue is about enabling a multi-root workspace to launch and debug extensions via extension host debugging.\r\n\r\nWe have code in the extension host to broadcast messages to that window which launched the extension host. We use the simple extension development path as a way to find the target window. This cannot work anymore once you are in a multi-root workspace where you can have multiple paths (and you can have multiple windows with the same path).\r\n\r\nAfter talking to @weinand we think that the best approach would be that the broadcast message is send to simply all windows and that it includes the debug session ID. With that information we can do the correct thing where we receive the message (in https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/parts/debug/electron-browser/debugService.ts#L162). \r\n\r\nI have pushed the change to broadcast to all windows and I added some workaround for now to enable EH debugging by simply checking if a EH session is active.
