there,\r\n\r\nI'm the maintainer of the [Dracula theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula) for vscode and I've been consistently hitting a singular annoyance: Highlighting light-colored text with a light color (as is the norm for dark themes) creates a really bad contrast situation.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5240018/26027577/4e0530f0-37de-11e7-889b-ec5a8ab8e8d4.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5240018/26027589/662fd022-37de-11e7-88db-3924d2a10f76.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to add in the ability to give highlighted text a shadow color so that contrast can be greatly enhanced. Example: https://codepen.io/dsifford/pen/GmdYvL\r\n\r\nThanks for considering! 😄 \r\n\r\n**Edit:** Another idea would be to automatically apply a shadow color to the text the same color as the editor background color. 👍 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26600","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26600/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26600/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26600/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/26600","id":228486277,"number":26600,"title":"On Save Focus moves to end of Line in jsx files","user":{"login":"pungggi","id":5635709,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5635709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pungggi","html_url":"https://github.com/pungggi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pungggi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pungggi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pungggi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pungggi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pungggi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pungggi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pungggi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pungggi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pungggi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-13T17:07:22Z","updated_at":"2017-05-13T17:11:26Z","closed_at":"2017-05-13T17:10:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code - Insiders 1.13.0-insider (5057c95e6b5a43ddecee0d6f663764b7c80f6c95, 2017-05-11T06:11:50.856Z)\r\n- OS Version: Windows_NT ia32 10.0.14393\r\n- Extensions: \r\n\r\n|Extension|Author|Version|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|vscode-styled-jsx|blanu|0.1.1|\r\n|vscode-exports-autocomplete|capaj|0.4.9|\r\n|vscode-npm-source|dkundel|1.0.0|\r\n|auto-close-tag|formulahendry|0.4.0|\r\n|auto-rename-tag|formulahendry|0.0.11|\r\n|code-runner|formulahendry|0.6.16|\r\n|rest-client|humao|0.14.3|\r\n|node-module-intellisense|leizongmin|1.3.0|\r\n|vs-color-picker|lihui|0.6.0|\r\n|PowerShell|ms-vscode|1.0.0|\r\n|debugger-for-chrome|msjsdiag|3.1.1|\r\n|color-highlight|naumovs|2.1.3|\r\n|rcgenerator|ngSoftware|0.0.3|\r\n|sort-imports|peterjuras|2.3.1|\r\n|vscode-template-literal-editor|plievone|0.8.4|\r\n|code-settings-sync|Shan|2.7.0|;\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

previously used file extensions to determine which files it handles or not. This was not great because it duplicates information and also fails to account for `file.associations`.\r\n\r\nFor the upcoming work on TS server plugin work, I switched to use `openTextDocument` for this check instead. However Dirk pointed out that this brings its own problems: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/26413#issuecomment-301010494 . I don't see any ways around this using the current api, and I also don't see how we can fix the `file.associations` issue using the old file extensions based approach\r\n\r\n**Fix**\r\nAdd a new `getLanguage` api to VSCode. This api returns the language normally associated with a resource (uri). It does not take into account any language mode that a user has explicitly changed or the first line based language detection (since the goal was to avoid opening the resource in the first place).\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me if the current implementation based on openTextDocument will actually cause any problems.
