When there are active selections and the cursor type is a block cursor, the column that the cursor is shown to occupy is supposed to be considered part of the selection.\n### STR\n1.

Move the cursor over the \"b\" in \"bar\"\n5. Using Shift+Right Arrow, select the entire word\n### Expected Results\n\nPasting in step 3 pastes the entire word \"foo\", and selecting the word \"bar\" with the keyboard in step 5 should leave the block cursor blinking over the \"r\", or alternatively, leave no visible trace of the cursor at all, while the selection is active.\n### Actual Results\n\nThe paste step in 3 only pastes \"fo\", and using the keyboard for selection in step 5 hints towards why: after selecting \"bar\", the block cursor is shown hovering over the space that follows instead of the \"r\" at the end of the word.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2996","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2996/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2996/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2996/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2996","id":133445223,"number":2996,"title":"Switching
