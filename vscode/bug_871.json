Or while testing, it would very helpul to be able to switch them on and off. \n\nAlso, it would be nice to have the disabled ones to NOT check for updates automatically while disabled.

settings (for example, I cannot provide symbols location if the user does not enable sourcemaps for the parser).\n\nWhen this happens, I'm showing a `warning` message, which is totally ok. Obviously the space there is limited; therefore I wanted to provide a `More Info` button which, when clicked, it will open a webpage (potentially a Github wiki) with a more detailed explanation of the problem.\n\nTo do that, I'm using `sendNotification` from the server sending the interested URL but, unfortunately, I didn't find any way to open an `http` URI from the client application. It looks like `vscode.previewHtml` does not support `http/s` schemas.\n\nWhat would be the best way to do

However, some tools might enforce options in a way that inferring could possibly be difficult (says me, a pretty serious JS newbie).

VSCode Version: Version 1.4.0-insider 01a3f868552dc8011adf4e79bee8cfb09babfe31\n- OS Version: macOS El Capitan\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. \"Edit\" > \"Find\"\n2.  Type in something to find in the current editor\n3. When it finds the string in your document a lineHighlight is added.\n\n<img width=\"1108\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-07-22 at 10 32 23 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11839736/17066295/3c0d0dc6-4ffb-11e6-8dfd-6a7fbc4aa229.png\">\n\n@alexandrudima, since this does not also occur in our Search viewlet, it feels inconsistent to me.  Also, this line highlight reduces the contrast of the highlighted found text, making it harder to see what is found.  Visual Studio IDE also does not use the lineHighlight for this.\n\n<img width=\"674\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-07-22 at 10 59 00 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11839736/17066315/57738a54-4ffb-11e6-82b6-1a159e5c199b.png\">\n\nAfter looking issue #2792, I can see the underlying problem that was trying to be solved with helping users find the active highlight, but perhaps it would not be needed if we had a stronger highlight color contrast.  At a minimum we should increase that highlight contrast anyway since it would be beneficial with or without the line highlight.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Keep the lineHighlight** (also add it to Search for consistency) and increase contrast on the highlight for found text.\n- **Remove lineHighlight** and increase contrast on the highlight for found text.\n- **Darken the lineHighlight color** so it can be stronger in contrast (may be detrimental to the experience of \"Go to line\", making the found line be less obvious).\n\n@stevencl do you have any thoughts on this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9630","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9630/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9630/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9630/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9630","id":167096584,"number":9630,"title":"Shortcut

I know that you may say fonts render with many shading so the final coloring may be changed and that's why I tried every color that I specified and even the background colors rendered incorrectly. \n\n<img width=\"477\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-07-22 at 9 04 58 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2157285/17064117/204cf27c-5050-11e6-8a72-cc64a568a370.png\">\n\nI don't know if it's a feature (which if it is, it's really a bad one) or a bug. If this is a bug I really hope that this issue helps you. But if it's part of the architecture; how it applies to colors and how can I choose a color in a way that after your filter it looks the way I want?\n\nThanks a lot\nPouya \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9629/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9628","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9628/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9628/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9628/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9628","id":167078496,"number":9628,"title":"Scroll highlight text within integrated terminal","user":{"login":"Healthfundr","id":6273435,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6273435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Healthfundr","html_url":"https://github.com/Healthfundr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Healthfundr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Healthfundr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Healthfundr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Healthfundr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Healthfundr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Healthfundr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Healthfundr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Healthfundr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Healthfundr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":366106217,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"E2A1C2","default":true},{"id":362694632,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/integrated-terminal","name":"integrated-terminal","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Tyriar","id":2193314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2193314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tyriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tyriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-22T16:03:57Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T21:55:44Z","closed_at":"2016-09-06T21:55:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Code 1.3.0 (e724f269ded347b49fcf1657fc576399354e6703, 2016-07-07T16:52:42.674Z)\n- OS Version: Darwin x64 15.5.0\n\nProblem:\nUnable to highlight and copy content that is longer than viewable terminal window.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
