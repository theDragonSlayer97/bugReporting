Download and install VS code on Windows 7 32 bit\r\n2. Runs fast first time after installation and opens up to the welcome screen\r\n3. Close, go to command prompt and run again Code --disable-extensions\r\n4. Nothing happens, open task manager and it's showing Code.exe and cpu is pegged at 99% \r\n5. Start a stopwatch, wait 10 minutes cpu varies between 99% and rarely dips to 97%.\r\n6. Give up.  No visible Code editor onscreen anywhere, just the task manager process is the only evidence it's doing anything; stop the process.\r\n\r\nI left it to start one time as I had to go out, came back about half an hour later and it was opened so at some point it *does* actually complete the startup but I have no idea how long it took.\r\n\r\nSame thing happens when I run it without disabling extensions by the way and I've tried it through several reboots uninstalls etc.  \r\n\r\nReproduces without extensions: Yes\r\n\r\nI've used Code on Linux previously (64bit Debian in virtual machine on same host computer) and it runs very fast and is very useful, however I wanted to consolidate all my work to my windows dev machine and ran into this issue.\r\n\r\nThis is a clean install, I'm guessing my difference from others may be that I have vs 2012 installed already?

it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29797","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29797/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29797/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29797/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29797","id":239287922,"number":29797,"title":"I
