For example: connect to remote hive in the terminal meanwhile write some hql script in text window. Or some thing like writing python script meanwhile connect to ipython in terminal. I have to keep coping from text and pasting into terminal all the time\r\n\r\nI think send selected text directly to current terminal maybe a better way to achieve REPL and inteactive

I'm not sure whether I am doing something wrong, so here are the steps to reproduce those issues and the changes I had to make along the way to get it working for me.\r\n\r\n**1.** Copy **lsp-sample** directory from repository https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples\r\n\r\n**2.** Open **lsp-sample** folder in vscode\r\n\r\n**3.** In the integrated terminal run **npm install**\r\n\r\n**3.** Press F5 to start the **Launch Client** debug session\r\n\r\n**4.** Observe the error: \"Could not find the preLaunchTask 'Client Watch'\".\r\n\r\n**5.** Modify launch.json preLaunchTasks to **watch:client** for **Launch Client** configuration, and **watch:server** for **Attach to Server** configuration.\r\n\r\n**6.** Press F5 again to launch the **Launch Client** debug session.\r\n\r\n**7.** Observe that it works this time.\r\n\r\n**8.**  Attempt to start the **Attach to Server** debug session\r\n\r\n**9.** Observe the error: 'Cannot connect to runtime; make sure that runtime is in 'legacy' debug mode.\r\n\r\n**10.** Change protocol value from **legacy** to **inspector** for **Attach to Server** configuration in launch.json\r\n\r\n**_Note_**: at this point the launch.json looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n  // List of configurations. Add new configurations or edit existing ones.\r\n  \"configurations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"Launch Client\",\r\n      \"type\": \"extensionHost\",\r\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\r\n      \"runtimeExecutable\": \"${execPath}\",\r\n      \"args\": [\r\n        \"--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceRoot}/client\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"stopOnEntry\": false,\r\n      \"sourceMaps\":

Server\",\r\n      \"type\": \"node\",\r\n      \"request\": \"attach\",\r\n      \"port\": 6009,\r\n      \"sourceMaps\": true,\r\n      \"outFiles\": [\r\n

_debugOptions_ line in **client/src/extension.ts** to the following:\r\n```javascript\r\nlet debugOptions = { execArgv: [\"--nolazy\", \"--inspect=6009\"] };\r\n```\r\n\r\n**12.** Re-launch the **Launch Client** configuration and **Attach to Server** configuration\r\n\r\n**13.** Observe that there are now no longer any errors and you can debug both the client and server code.\r\n\r\n<!--

is a feature request. It would be nice if user could specify the following things in preferences for paths that are copied to clipboard when you use \"Copy path of Active File\" command:\r\n\r\n- *separators type*: Windows style i.e. backwards slashes or Unix style - i.e. normal slashes. \r\n- *base*: currently paths begin from file system root (e.g. C:\\Users\\...). It would be nice to specify that when you are copying paths to clipboard you want it to start from project folder root or from a folder where git repository is based.\r\n\r\nUse case:\r\n=====\r\n\r\nI'm on Windows. I use VCS, namely git, from integrated terminal. When I want to perform git commands on opened files (like for example `git blame` ) I have to get hold of file path. But git expects file paths to start from project root, not from File system root. It also only understands normal slashes. So now every time I want to do simple git blame or git log on a certain file I have to do a lot of work:\r\n\r\n1. Copy file path\r\n2. Insert it somewhere in the opened editor\r\n3. Open \"Replace\" command\r\n4. Replace all occurances of \"\\\\\" to \"/\"\r\n5. Select part of the path that starts from project root folder and copy it to cpipboard\r\n6. Return focus to terminal and insert my file path\r\n\r\nI have to do quite a lot of this during my day, and honestly it isn't much fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35084/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4528","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"C767:366F:C2857A:17B24D1:59D9317B","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=25>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=23>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"33767edd2fe97eef6e7ac3cdb3b81680\"","status":"200 OK"}}
