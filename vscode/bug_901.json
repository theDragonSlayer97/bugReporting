VSCode Version: 1.3.0-insider\n- OS Version: Windows 10\n\nI have been running into some issues with the the auto-fetch and other polling git operations. My general workflow is that I:\n*Edit files as necessary\n*Switch to the command line and do whatever git magic I need to do\n*go back to using VSCode\n\nHowever, since VSCode performs git actions at least every 10 seconds which means that if I am perfoming a long string of git operations in my terminal, then I often run into the `fatal: Unable to create 'C:/path/to/repo/.git/index.lock': File exists.` error. The only way to ensure this doesn't happen is to close out of the editor and reopen when I am done with whatever I am doing with git.\n\nThe editor really shouldn't have to be running full-on locking git operations every time it wants to check up on a file. This is a problem I haven't had with Atom, so I will look into what they are doing, and post that below in this issue. There are definitely other options on determining the file changes.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open a repository in VSCode\n2. Try switching between branches\n3. Every third (or so) operation will result in the `fatal: Unable to create 'C:/Users/Austin/Documents/rust-on-gpu/.git/index.lock': File exists.` error\n\nNote: It might be more likely to occur with more expensive git operations.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8744","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8744/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8744/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8744/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/8744","id":163766842,"number":8744,"title":"Saving

Will the whole extension folder just be deleted, and all those additional files will be gone? That would actually be my preferred option. Or is there any other implication of such a design? Should I really store those additional files somewhere else?
