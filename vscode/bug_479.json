VS Code \"shell\" opens and freezes (about every 2 - 4 times, especially with 2+ projects open)\r\n\r\nNot sure how to reproduce for you but about every 2 - 4 times I open VS Code, it simply freezes (it will open the VS Code shell but the sidebar, my files, etc won't show up. Just the shell, where it freezes.) and sometimes I have a hard time force-quitting it. The only way to get it working again is to force quit, but then I quit out of all of my other open projects. I have tested it out on both iTerm and Terminal but the issue still persists. It is worse if I have 2+ apps in other VS Code windows open. It's been going on for about 1 - 2 weeks. Let me know if I can provide anymore details and/or what I can do to resolve this issue if it's on my end. Thanks guys.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21424","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21424/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21424/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21424/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21424","id":210260046,"number":21424,"title":"Typescript 2.2 Auto Import and Tslint Formatting","user":{"login":"arciisine","id":1264175,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1264175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arciisine","html_url":"https://github.com/arciisine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arciisine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arciisine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arciisine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arciisine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arciisine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arciisine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arciisine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arciisine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arciisine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":286886536,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/upstream","name":"upstream","color":"708090","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-02-25T20:34:17Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T01:57:55Z","closed_at":"2017-03-01T01:57:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

Currently I have to do one of the following:\r\n\r\n- Open the \"source\" file directly which would allow users to clobber it\r\n- Copy the file to a temp file and open that and then remember to clean it up. Users would still have to \"save as\" to save it in a location that is useful to them\r\n- Use the new overload to open an untitled, empty text document and then use an edit to populate the contents.\r\n\r\nThe last one is the most viable but seems unnecessary.

Do you have a question? Please ask it on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode -->\r\n\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.9.1\r\n- OS Version: Windows 7\r\n\r\nThe issues title could be rename properly \r\n\r\nOk this on is a bit weird but it's a weird stuff I was doing\r\n\r\nIn fact, I was regrouping with the multiple line cursor\r\n\r\nFor the purpose I will give you a \"File\" (multiple line in the description)\r\n\r\nThe weird stuff happen with the lines with this KeyWord \"WeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine\"\r\n\r\nSo I give you the example that work well at first and after I will write the instruction that doesn't work as expected\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Double click on \"WhatEverStuff\" to select the keyword\r\n2. Ctrl + F (Open the find tools bar)\r\n3. Alt + Enter (Select all \"WhatEverStuff\")\r\n4. After select all, \r\n     * Press Alt + Arrow Up Multiple time until every \"WhatEverStuff\" is at the beginning of the files\r\n\r\n**For now every \"WhatEverStuff\" is regroup and no problem have happen right now !!!**\r\n\r\n5. Double click on \"WeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine\" to select the keyword\r\n6. Ctrl + F (Open the find tools bar)\r\n7. Alt + Enter (Select all \"WeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine\")\r\n8. After select all, \r\n     * Press Alt + Arrow Up until everything is at the beginning of the folder\r\n\r\n## But you will see that only the first \"WeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine\" of each 3 following Keyword has goes down\r\n\r\nSo you need to Restart step 7 and step 8 two times again to make it regroup and it's no more the same as I would expect to work (every 3 following keyword should goes down at the same time)\r\n\r\n\r\nFile Here : \r\n```\r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 1  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 2  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 3  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 4  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 5  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 6  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 7  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 8  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 9  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 10  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 11  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 12  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 13  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 14  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 15  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 16  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 17  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 18  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 19  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 20  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 21  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 22  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 23  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 24  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWorkingStuff        \r\n```\r\n\r\nFile result after doing step 1 to step 8 one time : \r\n```\r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 22  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 19  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 16  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 13  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 10  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 7  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 4  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 1  \r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWhatEverStuff\r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 2  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 3  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 5  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 6  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 8  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 9  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 11  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 12  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 14  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 15  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 17  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 18  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 20  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 21  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWorkingStuff         \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 23  \r\nWeirdStuffHappenOnThoseLine 24  \r\nOtherStuffUnneccessary        \r\nWorkingStuff         \r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4883","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"B9F0:366D:37397D:7CF425:59D939B7","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=480>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=478>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"c73a650227112d09d616bbbb29bc29f9\"","status":"200 OK"}}
