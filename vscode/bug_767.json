This is _very_ confusing, as you can accidentally, and very subtly, change the file you are editing from the one you thought it was. Code should use the path of files to disambiguate them, and allow having multiple files of the same name open at the same time.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

I have been reported several time in many issues here on VS Code repository, but @AurelioDeRosa managed to reproduce the issue and documented the steps [here](https://github.com/Zignd/HTML-CSS-Class-Completion/issues/12#issuecomment-246828941).\n\nI've managed to identify what could might be causing the issue, it basically happens here:\n\n[**src/extension.ts#L36-L63**](https://github.com/Zignd/HTML-CSS-Class-Completion/blob/master/src/extension.ts#L36-L63)\n\n```\nreturn async.each(uris, async (uri, callback) => {\n    try {\n        Array.prototype.push.apply(definitions, await ParseEngineGateway.callParser(uri));\n        callback();\n    } catch (error) {\n        failedLogs += `${uri.path}\\n`;\n        failedLogsCount++;\n        callback();\n    }\n}, (error) => {\n    if (error) {\n        console.error('Failed to parse the documents: ', error);\n        return reject(error);\n    }\n\n    uniqueDefinitions = _.uniqBy(definitions, (x) => x.className);\n\n    // ...removed to shorten the post\n\n    notifier.notify('zap', 'CSS classes cached (click to cache again)');\n\n    return resolve();\n});\n```\n\nAt this point the extension parse the found CSS files in asynchronously and in parallel. During debugging I managed to identify that at the beginning some files manage to get parsed, but then VS Code and the extension freezes. I'd like to understand what I'm doing wrong, so that I can fix the issue, but I have run out of ideas on how to resolve it.\n\nThanks in advance.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4595","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507411331","x-github-request-id":"D8E4:429A:85588B:166A13A:59D940E0","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=768>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=766>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"3311645cbe0423a6851cbe5ec8979695\"","status":"200 OK"}}
