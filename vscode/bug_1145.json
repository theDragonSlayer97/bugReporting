Here's a proposal that I wrote up with some initial ideas:\n\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/81\n\nThe core requirement for my extensibility model is to be able to add new commands to VS Code after my extension has already loaded, without also having to add them to my package.json.  This will allow my users to write new actions, analyzers, and code formatters which they could invoke using VS Code's great keybinding system.\n\nCurrently the API lets you register the ID of the command and the function to be called.  If we could also get parameters for the display name and category of the command it should be enough to accomplish full dynamic command registration.  As a bonus it would nice to have a parameter for registering a default key binding for the command, but it's OK if that comes later.\n\nI realize that there's probably a reason why you'd prefer to have commands be registered in package.json rather than completely in code.  My guess is that it allows the commands to be displayed before the extension is fully loaded.  The dynamic commands I'd like to have wouldn't need to be displayed until the extension is fully loaded anyway, so this doesn't matter as much to me.\n\nThanks for considering this!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1422/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1421","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1421/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1421/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1421/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1421","id":122754246,"number":1421,"title":"Allow

working on a compile-to-js language called [Skew](http://www.skew-lang.org/). Visual Studio Code's language services API has been really awesome so far and I'm impressed how easy it was to hook up my compiler to provide standard features like tooltips and diagnostics and so on. I tried to do the same thing in Atom and ended up needing to implement tooltips and squiggly underlines and stuff which was a bummer. So great job on the API!\n\nRight now the primary target language for the Skew compiler is JavaScript, so it makes sense to run Skew code with the node debugger target. I recently discovered that the debugger supports source maps so I'd like to focus on making Visual Studio Code the primary IDE for Skew. However, Skew is different enough from JavaScript that the values in the debugger panel don't make sense sometimes and the value tooltips often don't work. Some examples: the object context is called \"self\" instead of \"this\", enums show up as numbers instead of their textual names, function names in the call stack use their rewritten names instead of their original names.\n\nIs there a way to hook into the view layer of the debugger to provide better names, tooltips, and value visualizations for languages that compile to JavaScript? The debugger API seems to be at the wrong level. I want to leverage the existing node debugger, just change the view layer when the current file is Skew code. Doing this customization in the view layer also seems like the right place to me because it means debugging a project that uses multiple compile-to-js languages would be able to work. Other languages could benefit too. For example, tooltips currently don't work when debugging CoffeeScript for variables that use the \"@\" prefix to access instance variables.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1405","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1405/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1405/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1405/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1405","id":122683165,"number":1405,"title":"Format

working on the PowerShellEditorServices support and right now the ordering for cmdlet parameters is alphabetical.  In PowerShell this is typically not what you want as there are a dozen or so \"common\" parameters that automatically show up on every cmdlet i.e. PowerShell provides them for all cmdlets.  \n\nSo in editors like PowerShell ISE it is common to list the cmdlet-specific parameters first followed by the common parameters.  I thought I could use CompletionItem.SortText to get a custom sort order but it doesn't seem to be working.  Here's a log of the messages returned to VSCode for this list:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"label\": \"-FileVersionInfo\",\n    \"kind\": 10,\n    \"detail\": null,\n    \"documentation\": null,\n    \"sortText\": \"007-FileVersionInfo\",\n    \"filterText\": \"Regular Parameter\",\n    \"insertText\": null,\n    \"textEdit\": {\n    \"range\": {\n        \"start\": {\n        \"line\": 49,\n        \"character\": 12\n        },\n        \"end\": {\n        \"line\": 49,\n        \"character\": 13\n        }\n    },\n    \"newText\": \"-FileVersionInfo\"\n    },\n    \"data\": null\n},\n{\n    \"label\": \"-ErrorAction\",\n    \"kind\": 10,\n    \"detail\": null,\n    \"documentation\": null,\n    \"sortText\": \"008-ErrorAction\",\n    \"filterText\": \"Common Parameter\",\n    \"insertText\": null,\n    \"textEdit\": {\n    \"range\": {\n        \"start\": {\n        \"line\": 49,\n        \"character\": 12\n        },\n        \"end\": {\n        \"line\": 49,\n        \"character\": 13\n        }\n    },\n    \"newText\": \"-ErrorAction\"\n    },\n    \"data\": null\n},\n```\n\nKind should be CompletionItemKind.Variable.  I was experimenting with other kinds to see if they worked any better - no joy so far.\n\nAlso it is not clear from the documentation how you use FilterText and what it looks like in the UI.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1402","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1402/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1402/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1402/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1402","id":122672664,"number":1402,"title":"[html]
