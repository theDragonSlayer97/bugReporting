--disable-extensions`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Let's assume we have opened repo directory in Explorer with some directories inside:\r\n```\r\n/repo\r\n   |- /node\r\n   |   |- /routes\r\n   |   |   |- firstApi.js\r\n   |   |   |- secondApi.js\r\n   |   |   |- thirdApi.js\r\n   |- public\r\n```   \r\n2. In each *Api.js file we have line:\r\n`var m = require('../views/messages.json');`\r\nor\r\n`var m = require('../views/messages');`\r\n\r\n3. I want to remove these lines, so I am right clicking _node_ directory an choosing __Find in Folder__ and trying to match regexp `.*messages.*\\n?`\r\n\r\n4. VSCode writes: `No results found in './node' - Search again in all files` and `No results found. Review your settings for configured exclusions - Open Settings` when clicking __Search again in all files__.\r\nI also tried to set __files to include__ option to `./node/**/*.js` but it still doesn't find anything.\r\n\r\n5. This is wrong because I can match this regexp in each file respectively by:\r\n  * opening these files double-clicking it in Explorer (e.g. first and second Api.js files)\r\n  * hitting *Ctrl+F* and typing the same regexp `.*messages.*\\n?`\r\n\r\n6. With _firstApi.js_ and _secondApi.js_ still opened (but _thirdApi.js_ closed) I am repeating step 3 and now it still doesn't find anything but when clicking _Search again in all files_ or searching in `./node/**/*.js` it matches proper lines only in opened files (if we close second and open third Api.js file result will be only in these files then).\r\n\r\n7. Things are different when **I remove `\\n?` from regexp** as follows: `.*messages.*`\r\nWith this changed regexp I get results in every file (with _files to include_ set to `**/*.js` or blank, with any files opened or everything closed).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `\\n?` part is important for me because I don't want to leave empty line.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31117/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31116","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31116/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31116/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31116/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31116","id":244304409,"number":31116,"title":"Identation Problem in Workspace Menu Items of Menu \"File\" (Spanish translation)","user":{"login":"CarlosAzocar","id":18235355,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/18235355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlosAzocar","html_url":"https://github.com/CarlosAzocar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlosAzocar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlosAzocar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlosAzocar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlosAzocar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlosAzocar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlosAzocar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlosAzocar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlosAzocar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlosAzocar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":297952453,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/workbench","name":"workbench","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"danyeh","id":19785531,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19785531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh","html_url":"https://github.com/danyeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"danyeh","id":19785531,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19785531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh","html_url":"https://github.com/danyeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danyeh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-20T09:47:14Z","updated_at":"2017-09-27T15:38:13Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Do you have a question?

request: A way to specify the opening size/location of new windows, whether they are opened by shift-cmd-n (on Mac) or by an extension such as \"Project Manager\".\r\n\r\nWhen I open a new window on my Mac laptop, I need all the screen I can get. I always have to manually drag the corners of OS X's default, useless mini-window to the upper left corner under the menubar and to the lower right corner of the screen. (The taskbar is permanently hidden, so it really is the lower-right corner of the screen.) I wish I could specify this state in preferences so each time I opened a window it would open in this maximally useful size/position rather than forcing me to always drag it there.\r\n\r\nI'm NOT asking for the Mac's weird \"full screen\" state that creates an alternative desktop with no menu bars and doesn't work right with cmd-tab, etc. OS X totally screwed up the simple concept of \"full screen\" that Windows and older Macs had no trouble with, but if you want to include that as an additional option, fine, as long as \"normal\" fullscreen (just stretch the window under the menu bar from corner to corner) is also an option. Other options might be \"default\" (the current one), specific pixels (upper-left & lower-right), most-recently-closed, or whatever. All I would want would be old-fashioned \"full screen\" and, maybe, \"specified corners\" (which I might use on a jumbo monitor but might not).\r\n\r\nThanks. (I LOVE VS Code, BTW. I've been programming for decades, and I still need to use multiple editors, but VS Code has become my overall favorite.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31110","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31110/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31110/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31110/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31110","id":244286939,"number":31110,"title":"Intellisense

Moreover, we do not access the core Electron APIs in our tests.\r\n\r\nThis is not happening on consistent basis, therefore no idea how to reproduce.\r\n\r\n@joaomoreno I might need your help on this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31105","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31105/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31105/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31105/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/31105","id":244272116,"number":31105,"title":"tsserver.js high cpu usage","user":{"login":"teterovic","id":7413906,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7413906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teterovic","html_url":"https://github.com/teterovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teterovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teterovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teterovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teterovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teterovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teterovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teterovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teterovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teterovic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":291055694,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/typescript","name":"typescript","color":"1d76db","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mjbvz","id":12821956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12821956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz","html_url":"https://github.com/mjbvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjbvz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-07-20T07:41:18Z","updated_at":"2017-08-28T13:59:28Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- VSCode Version: Version 1.14.1 (1.14.1)\r\n- OS Version: MacOs 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
