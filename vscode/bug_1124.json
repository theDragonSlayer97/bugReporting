This PR should solve that by sorting extensions based on install count. \n\nThere was some concern about adding the \"install count\" filter to the API. Here is the profiling using a python script and [cProfile](https://docs.python.org/2/library/profile.html#module-cProfile). \n\n| Test Run | No Install Count | Retrieving Install Count |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 2.212 | 1.792 |\n| 2 | 1.792 | 2.193 |\n| 3 | 1.805 | 1.798 |\n| 4 | 1.755 | 1.856 |\n| 5 | 1.708 | 1.874 |\n| Mean | 1.854 | 1.903 |\n\nAs you can see there is a slight slow down. Seems trivial to me though. \n\nFeedback on the UI is appreciated. \n\nYou'll notice I made a trade off in the UI to remove \"days ago\" in favor of install count. I rearranged install count with version. I played around with adding \"installs\" next to the number, but decided against it only so as not to clutter the UI. \n\n![screen shot 2016-01-15 at 3 07 30

have a task defined that uses a problem matcher to create warnings. \n\nAssume it creates 5 warnings for file A and 2 warnings for file B. The total warning count shown in the status bar is now 7.\n\nNow follow these steps:\n- Open `View>Show Errors and Warnings` \n- Navigate to file A (do not fix any warnings)\n- Open `View>Show Errors and Warnings` again\n- Navigate to file B\n\nAt this point the warning count in the status bar drops to 2. This is confusing since without doing  anything the 5 warnings have disappeared. \n\nThe reason is that when I open file A from Errors and Warnings it isn't put into the working files. Then when I open file B, File A is closed and its markers get cleared.\n\nTo avoid this confusion I suggest that opening a file from Errors and Warnings puts the file into the 'Working files' section, that is, the file is kept open and the warnings do not disappear.  So the effect would be the same as if I double clicked the file from the explorer.\n\nAssigning to Jo as the owner of diagnostics and the Errors and Warnings quick box. @dbaeumer

we have the Monaco editor localized. This plan item captures how we get to a localized VS Code. \r\n\r\nWe need to localize both the `core` and the `extensions` we bundle.\r\n## Core + Helper Apps\r\n\r\nThe core includes the main process, renderer, and extension host. All these components use AMD and we will use the same localization approach as is used in the Monaco editor (`nls.localize`).\r\n\r\nThe core includes some built-in languages like PHP, CSS, JSON. Each of these languages comes with strings that are used as documentation for Intellisense or validation (PHP built-in functions, CSS attribute descriptions, JSON schema descriptions from http://schemastore.org/json/). We will not externalize and translate these strings initially.\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n- [x] Provide a tslint rule to check for non-externalized strings.  @dbaeumer \r\n- [x] Externalize the remaining strings. Major areas of the workbench are already localized, but there are gaps. @Microsoft/vscode\r\n- [x] Review the places where we expose exception messages directly to the user (e.g. editor, explorer, git, search) and ensure that a higher-level translatable error message is shown in the UI, which incluldes the raw error as detail in parenthesis. @bpasero \r\n- [x] Localize the Search App. @dbaeumer \r\n- [x] Localize the Git App @dbaeumer \r\n- [x] Plugin Host @dbaeumer \r\n- [x] Main @dbaeumer \r\n- [x] Renderer @dbaeumer \r\n## Extensions\r\n\r\nExtensions are implemented using the CommonJS modules and the AMD based externalization used in the Code cannot be use. The goal is to use the same file format for the language bundles used for the Core and extensions.\r\n\r\nAn extensions has contributes strings in the package.json and from the code.  We need a localization support for both.\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n- [x] Localization support for the package.json.\r\n- [x] Provide a node localization module that uses the same file format as for the core and that can be used by extensions..\r\n- [x] Provide nls-checking tool to check for non-localized strings for the bundled extensions\r\n- Externalize bundled extensions (with user visible strings)\r\n  - [x] TypeScript\r\n  - [x] JSON\r\n  - :question: others\r\n## Debug Adapters\r\n- [x] Support that messages from the debug adapter can be localized @weinand \r\n## Development Tasks\r\n- [x] Support pseudo localization for testing.\r\n- [x] Document the localization support so that the community can contribute translations.\r\n- [x] Tools to enable contributions of translations.\r\n- [x] Support install/update localized Code versions.\r\n## Roadmap\r\n- January\r\n  - Core + Apps is localized\r\n  - Demo Code in German (minus extensions)\r\n- February\r\n  - Bundled extensions are localized\r\n  - Bundled debug adapter are localized\r\n  - Demo Code in German with a localized extension\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2041/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2040","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2040/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2040/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2040/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2040","id":126842470,"number":2040,"title":"Debug:

double-clicking, people have different expectations across various languages.\nThe ability to define custom highlighting rules based on the selected text would simultaneously solve a lot of highlighting issues and increase the flexibility of the editor.\n\nMy motivation for bringing this up comes from my frustration with variable selection in PHP.\nWhen double-clicking 'foo' in '$foo->bar()' you will end up selecting '$foo-', my preference  would be 'foo'.\nI also noticed another issue regarding double clicking white-space where the user would like it to select all connected white-space.\nThese kinds of rules would be perfectly suited for on the fly user customisation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2035","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2035/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2035/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2035/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2035","id":126743084,"number":2035,"title":"Document
