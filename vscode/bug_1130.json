colleague showed me something interesting today.\n\nHe said he had multiple VS Code windows open (in Mac OS X) and installed an extension. He was notified that the installation was successful and that he should restart, so he clicked the restart button. As expected, the VS Code window closed and reopened and the extension was available.\n\nHowever, he then switched to another VS Code window and saw that his newly installed extension was unavailable.\n\nWe noticed it was because clicking the restart button only restarts the active VS Code window, not all of them. So you might still have other CS Code windows that do not get the extension until they are manually restarted.\n\nWhat might potentially make this more complicated is that VS Code has the session restore setting and the default is to restore only 1 window. So if you kill all code processes and relaunch code, and the user had multiple open when they installed the extension, then by default only 1 of them will \"restart\" and the rest will remain closed.\n\nIt might be an idea to temporarily change the editor setting to restore all, then kill all code processes and relaunch, then change the setting back... or maybe that's a terrible idea, but hey it's a suggestion!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1871","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1871/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1871/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1871/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1871","id":125595627,"number":1871,"title":"Linux:

`editor.insertSpaces` setting can autodetect if it should insert spaces or tabs. Some people like tabs more then spaces, but it's just personal preference.\n\nI think in Code < 0.10 it inserted tabs when the setting was set to `auto`. In Code >= 0.10 it changed to spaces. I'm more a tab guy, except for `json` files. So that's why I don't want to set it to `false` because I would have to change it forth and back when in a JSON file.\n\nThe setting should not be reverted, but maybe an extra setting like `editor.insertSpacesDefault` which can only be set to `true` and `false` and has a default of `true` (to not break the current behaviour). If `editor.insertSpaces` is set to `auto` and a new file is created, it will check the `editor.insertSpacesDefault` setting.\n\n@alexandrudima I guess you are the person for this as you wrote the tests regarding the `insertSpaces` autodetect

file, at the first ABC.  I hit Ctrl+F to show the Find dialog.  I type ABC.  The first ABC is highlighted.  I hit Esc to exit the Find dialog.\nThe cursor is now at end of the first line, with ABC on that line highlighted.  I hit delete to remove it and change the text to XYZ.   At this point the text editor looks like this:\n\n```\nXYZ\nABC\nXYZ\nABC\n```\n\nThe cursor is at end of the first line.\n\nI hit F3 to \"Find Next\" to find the next occurrence of ABC, but instead it searches for XYZ.  The reason is because hitting F3 changes what's being searched for.

I continue I just want to say thanks for all the hard work on making visual studio code a fantastic editor. I prefer it to WebStorm, Atom, Sublime and anything else!\n\nOk to the main point, I have noticed what I think is a bug.\n\nWhen editing simple JS files (although not tried with other languages), if I double click a word (to highlight it) and then start tying (i.e. to replace it), it sometimes ignores my typing.\n\nI'm using the standard dark theme and I have noticed that when this is the case, the highlight is a slightly different colour to the normal editable selected text highlight.\n\nI have also noticed that is happens more often if I double click quickly on a word, as opposed to if I double click more slowly.\n\nI have a feeling that because this is running on Electron and essentially some kind of web application, maybe there is a race condition of sorts where if I double click too fast, the electron framework detects a select \"span element\" as opposed to the editor detecting that I'm highlighting a word for editing.\n\nIt might be a bug in the underlying Electron framework and not VS Code itself, but I have no idea, just suggesting. I have asked a friend who uses Atom on the same setup as me (also uses Electron) and he says he can't replicate, but he did say he uses a plugin which highlights the same words as the selected word (https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected).\n\nFor additional information that might be of relevance in reproducing the issue, I am using VS Code 0.10.6 (latest release), Mac OS X (version 10.10.5), using the application in full screen mode (i.e. Command+Ctrl+F) and using an external USB mouse.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1849","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1849/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1849/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1849/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1849","id":125355646,"number":1849,"title":"[themes] More colorful default theme -

In December we decided to remove these again, to stay in sync with the classic Visual Studio Dark and Light themes.\n\nFrom reactions in #1270 and #1470 and other issues, we learned that we have fans of both the classic Visual Studio dark and light themes as well as the more colorful version, e.g., from [comment](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1470#issuecomment-166152680)\n\n> The `Dark` and `Light` default themes were very nice in 0.10.3, I'm already missing them.\n\nSo we decided to bring the colors back in new themes, 'Dark+' and 'Light+'.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6461412/12168352/e64004c0-b531-11e5-8e6b-2b90c16e4939.png)\n\nYou can currently try these out by installing the extension 'Colorful Default Themes'. The plan is to add them to the built-in themes in the January build.\n\nIn addition to 4 major colors in the Visual Studio themes (comments, strings, numbers and keywords) we now have again colors for\n- control flow keywords\n- type names\n- function names\n- parameter names\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6461412/12168372/fe1ae9c0-b531-11e5-8578-0de2ba719fab.png)\n\nWhen trying the new themes out, you will still find some keywords like 'import', 'module' nor correctly highlighted. These are issues in the tokenizer that we are working on. Please post your findings here, if possible add a code snippet and don't forget to mention for what language it is :-)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4870","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507415105","x-github-request-id":"A50A:429A:87A6F8:16CFA7B:59D94891","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1131>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1192>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/41881900/issues?state=all&page=1129>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d7d4c01a5fa4dc817badaa5069a07f41\"","status":"200 OK"}}
